Gold Loses Its Luster As an Asset

Good as gold isn't as good as it used to be.
Once the bedrock of the global financial system, gold is increasingly just another asset in a world full of
commodities, currencies and securities.
President Clinton reminded the world of that fact yesterday when he submitted his fiscal year-2000 budget
request to Congress. He told lawmakers he will ask them to allow the International Monetary Fund to sell $1.4
billion of its gold stash to finance debt relief for poor countries.
A few years ago that might have seemed careless. After all, the IMF is a financial backstop for 182 member
nations, and its huge gold reserve -- 103 million troy ounces -- is convincing evidence of its solidity.
But in today's low-inflation environment, the IMF's stock of dollars, euros, yen and other hard currencies
seems convincing enough. The administration calculates that a small risk -- selling five million troy ounces --
is justified by the potential benefit from helping the world's poorest countries escape crushing debts.
Gold's crumbling popularity led to a sharp price decline between 1996 and 1998, from which the yellow metal
still hasn't recovered. The front-month February futures contract trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange's Comex unit settled yesterday at $289.20 a troy ounce. That was up $2.90 from Friday's close but
still in the doldrums long term: In March of 1996, the front-month contract's price was more than $400.
"The original argument that central banks, governments and multilateral institutions like the IMF should hold
gold as a way of being prudent no longer holds much water," said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the
University of California at Berkeley.
Gold's decline in importance to international monetary policy began in 1971, when the U.S. abandoned its
long policy of buying or selling gold to approved central banks at a fixed price of $35 an ounce, and thereby
killed the last vestige of the gold standard.
"I think it's wrong to regard gold as being totally demonetized," said Philip Klapwijk, managing director at
Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd., a London firm that tracks the gold market. "But I think that's the direction
it's headed in."
Critical has been the Federal Reserve's success in conquering inflation, which is running about 2% a year.
Gold's appeal to investors long has been as a hedge against inflation.
"If the U.S. were to engage in a period of poor and erratic economic policies, people would say they need an
alternative," said Morris Goldstein, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington
think tank. "But people now are happy to hold dollars."
That's true of central banks and governments, too. Granted, the U.S. hasn't seriously considered selling its
ample gold reserve -- 262 million troy ounces -- and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is known to oppose such
a move. European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg, eager to win a reputation for prudence, hinted
just last week the ECB would hang on to its gold reserves.
But other countries -- including Australia and ECB member Belgium -- have liquidated some gold holdings.
For the past 10 years, central banks have sold an average of 9.3 million troy ounces of gold a year,
according to Gold Fields Mineral Services.

For now, the sale by the IMF as proposed by Mr. Clinton isn't likely to rattle markets because the idea has
been bandied about by government officials in several countries for some time. "To a large extent, the market
has discounted IMF sales, and the quantity isn't that significant," Mr. Klapwijk said.
But gold's decline as a reserve asset has made it a tempting target for politicians looking for resources.
"People look for pockets of finance that haven't been tapped yet and don't involve going directly to Congress
to ask for money," Mr. Goldstein said.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
WHEAT: Egypt's decision to purchase wheat from France and Australia instead of the U.S. sent futures falling
at the Chicago Board of Trade, according to brokers and analysts. The nearby March contract dropped 5.75
cents to $2.6975 a bushel. "The wheat market is finally realizing that there's no market for our [U.S.] wheat,"
said Steve Bruce, broker with ED&F Man on the CBOT floor. Egypt purchased 120,000 metric tons of French
wheat and 180,000 metric tons of Australian wheat over the weekend, with the French wheat selling for much
cheaper than the U.S. wheat. The French sold Egypt soft red wheat for $93 a metric ton, which is about $10
cheaper than U.S. offers for soft red wheat. Steve Koch, analyst with consulting firm and brokerage
Stewart-Peterson Group in West Bend, Wis., said the news of Egypt's purchase along with rains in the
southern Plains overnight pressured wheat prices. "U.S. wheat is so uncompetitive in the world that it kind of
shocked the trade," he said.
COPPER: London Metal Exchange warehouse stockpiles hit an all-time high of 646,675 tons yesterday,
another sign of continued oversupply in the market. Still, prices took a break from their long bear market, with
copper for three-month delivery at the LME rising $4.50 to end at $1,434.50 per metric ton. May futures at the
Comex gained 0.1 cent to settle at 65.45 cents a pound. Analysts at Macquarie Equities Ltd., reporting in their
daily commodities report, noted traders expect still more copper from Chile.
HOGS: Futures gained at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to foggy weather in the Midwest and buying
by speculators, analysts said. The February contract added 1.57 cents to 42.60 cents a pound. Producers
didn't feel safe driving hogs to market for slaughter given the weather conditions, said Dave Maher, analyst
with Securities Corp. of Iowa in Cedar Rapids.

The Journal is exactly right in its commentary on the IMF's role in provoking financial turmoil in markets from
Jakarta to Moscow ("What Did It Get Us?" Review & Outlook, Jan. 20). The problem goes beyond the Fund's
day-to-day operations to its fundamental lack of guiding principles. As you point out, it does not see what sort
of "coordinated system of money might best let markets work."
This isn't a recent phenomenon, however. In the nearly three decades since the Bretton Woods system
ended, the IMF has developed into a negative force. Countries that have come under its sway see it as an
agent of U.S. bankers and financiers. Since the early 1970s, the Fund has impoverished much of the
developing world through its mindless formula of increasing taxes to balance budgets and depreciating
currencies to promote going-out-of-business export sales. Despite promises to reform, the IMF continues to
inflict its damaging policies on countries already suffering from financial and economic collapse.
Who can deny that the IMF helped wipe out the savings of ordinary citizens and families in Mexico when it
supported the devaluation of the peso four years ago? The hope that NAFTA would bring about a new era of
prosperity that would raise the standard of living in such poor states as Chiapas was quickly dashed.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reportedly told the Senate Banking Committee at the time that
the impoverishment of Mexico would not have occurred if we were on a gold standard -- which would have
meant both the peso and the dollar were convertible into the gold at a fixed rate. The same is true of the
Asian crisis, which sent Thailand and Indonesia off track as the Fed's monetary deflation caused the dollar to
appreciate against gold and other commodities.
In today's global economy, the primary source of economic instability is an international monetary
arrangement of fiat currencies that float against each other -- with no anchor, no solid reference point.
Lawmakers must turn their attention to this root cause of financial turbulence and not allow the IMF to use
global market turmoil as an excuse to expand its power. The IMF should not become a global "lender of last
resort" to bail out private banks and corporations (as George Soros has suggested).
Judy Shelton, in a Journal editorial-page commentary ("Brazil's Monetary Illusions -- and Ours," Jan. 21),
called the IMF the "ultimate enabler" for giving its blessings to proposals that would seek to impart integrity to
money through government manipulation of currency markets. As Brazil has shown, managed-float regimes
amount to monetary folly and lead to the collapse of whole economies. What entrepreneurs need is "money
that functions as a meaningful unit of account and a reliable store of value," as Ms. Shelton notes. Central
bank intervention is no match against speculators in today's $1.5 trillion daily turnover global market for
foreign exchange.
The Journal has stepped up to the water's edge. It should now take the plunge and urge Chairman
Greenspan and our political leaders to adopt a new international monetary arrangement linked to gold. Such
an arrangement would be the very antithesis of the so-called new "international financial architecture" now
being pursued by Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who favors continued reliance on
government-managed fiat currencies and who would grant expanded supervisory and central bank-like
powers to that bureaucratic Leviathan, the IMF.
The great 30-year experiment in floating exchange rates has clearly failed; restoring world-wide currency
stability must be our first order of business. We need a new global monetary arrangement to serve as the
foundation for expanded economic growth and to maximize the gains from free trade. The system should be
formally linked to the price of gold, which remains the most useful barometer of monetary stability and
provides early warning signals of impending inflation and deflat

Gore Proposes IMF Gold Sale to Help Poor Nations
Gore Proposes IMF Gold Sale to Help Poor Nations

DAVOS, Switzerland -- Detailing his ideas for the global economy, Vice President Al Gore called on the
International Monetary Fund to sell gold for the first time since 1980 to help poor nations.
The sales would be small -- about five million ounces from the IMF's 103 million-ounce hoard. The IMF would
use the interest on the gold sale to help finance an IMF program to reduce debt burdens in poor nations,
mostly in Africa.
An IMF official said any sales would be made gradually to try to avoid undermining gold prices. Indeed, the
IMF is exploring whether it can lend the gold to an institution, which would convert it into interest-bearing
securities. Ultimately, the IMF would retake possession of the gold.
Germany has objected for years to the IMF selling gold because it feared weakening the IMF's balance
sheet. But the new German government is more sympathetic to the plan, U.S. officials said.
(Gold futures rallied Friday on indications that European central banks will hang onto their gold reserves.
See Commodities column).
Mr. Gore's gold proposal was part of a speech on Friday meant to establish his credentials on international
economic issues. He told the annual World Economic Forum here that balanced budgets or government
surpluses were essential to U.S. prosperity.
In an interview, Mr. Gore said the administration believed that the economic boost from fiscal probity and low
interest rates would help continue the U.S. economic surge. Deficit spending -- a hallmark of earlier, activist
Democratic administrations -- should be reserved for "national emergencies," he said.
"I've gained in my overall appreciation for various macroeconomic factors," said Mr. Gore, who had pushed a
variety of industrial-policy and technology projects when he was a member of Congress before being elected
vice president in 1992.
"We did serious damage to this country's economic reputation in the investment community and world at
large by running chronic, huge uncontrolled deficits for so many years," Mr. Gore said. "The only way to firmly
re-establish the confidence that our economy needs was to end those deficits and reassure folks that we
have the capacity to control our own destiny."
While he said he wasn't forswearing fiscal stimulus, he said "it is far better to concentrate on establishing and
maintaining the highest level of confidence in fiscal responsibility."
In his speech, Mr. Gore also made a forceful case for free trade, an issue that has deeply divided members of
his party. He dropped a reference to "fair" trade -- often a code-word for protection -- which appeared in a
draft of the speech. Instead, he argued that "we must resist narrow appeals to protectionism and isolationism,
which only walls us off from prosperity itself." He also warned that the world must "prevent the financial crisis
of 1998 from becoming the trade crisis of 1999."
Regarding poor nations, Mr. Gore's gold proposal dovetails with a White House initiative on debt relief that
will be unveiled today as part of President Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget.
Other elements of the plan include $50 million to forgive debt of nations that buy land in tropical rainforests
and prohibit development there. The U.S. would also contribute $50 million to a World Bank fund to help poor
nations reduce World Bank debt. Another $41 million would be allocated to help pay down debt in Nicaragua
and Honduras, which were devastated by Hurricane Mitch.

"Debt relief means . . . more resources for environmental protection and child survival," Mr. Gore said at
Davos.
All the proposals must be approved by Congress, which has been skeptical of proposals that amount to
foreign aid.

Gold Rallies as Duisenberg Parries Gore's Plan

Gold Rallies as Duisenberg Parries Gore's Plan

NEW YORK -- Gold futures rallied Friday, helped by comments by European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg indicating that European central banks will hang onto their gold reserves.
Mr. Duisenberg's remarks held sway over those of U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who proposed selling "a
small proportion" of gold held by the International Monetary Fund for a debt-relief fund. Mr. Gore and Mr.
Duisenberg were attending the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland.
In trading Friday at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the most-active April gold
contract rose $1.60 to $288.20 a troy ounce, while the February contract rose $1.50 to $286.30 an ounce.
Mr. Duisenberg said gold reserves held by central banks are "reserves to hold and not reserves to spend."
That helped placate some of the continuing concerns about sales by European central banks, which last year
drove prices to a 19-year low.
"The market had a near obsession with central-bank sales last year and the year before. That seems to have
diminished with the successful launch of the Euro," said Jim Steel, commodities analyst at Refco Inc. in New
York. Mr. Duisenberg's remark "brings transparency. It's good for gold," he added.
One concern in the market was that the central banks of the 11 nations involved in European economic and
monetary union would sell gold to meet the fiscal criteria for EMU. After EMU's launch on Jan 1., that
concern is redundant.
Robin Alssid, precious metals manager at Mitsubishi International Corp. in New York, said Mr. Gore and Mr.
Duisenberg almost canceled out each other's comments but that Mr. Duisenberg had more impact.
"The idea of using gold from the IMF to fund developing nations is something that I think we've heard so
many times before and will be overhanging the market, but until it happens, I'm not sure it's going to have any
effect," Ms. Alssid said, referring to Mr. Gore's proposal.
Refco's Mr. Steel also pointed out that gold prices had continued to rise Thursday and Friday despite
strength in both U.S. stocks and the dollar, factors that usually spell weakness for the precious metal.
Ms. Alssid said gold seemed to find strength after falling on Wednesday below $285 an ounce, recognized by
traders as a key level on price charts. She said buying came in at $282, giving the metal good support that
brought it up to Friday's high of $287.70 an ounce. However, she said it could be tough for gold to push
above its next key resistance area of $290 to $292 an ounce.
In other commodity markets Friday:
COPPER: Futures prices rose slightly on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after
earlier falling to a 12-year low Friday. The March contract added 0.15 cent to 64.50 cents a pound after hitting
an intraday low of 63.60 cents. Jim Steel, analyst at Refco Inc. in New York, said short covering -- the buying
of futures to balance previous sales -- started as participants became nervous about prices dropping below
64 cents.
SOYBEANS: Futures fell to an 11-year low for the fourth straight session at the Chicago Board of Trade. The
March contract dropped 3.50 cents to $5.0675 a bushel. "The big story continues to be the pretty much ideal
weather in South America," said Don Roose, analyst with U.S. Commodities in West Des Moines, Iowa.
"There's a chance for a record crop" there, he said, "and with the [slide] in the [Brazilian] real, they'll be
competitive."

BERLIN -- What do you do with a building that was erected by Hitler, used to store Nazi gold and then
became the headquarters of a communist dictatorship?
So runs the history of the Reichsbank, home of Hitler's central bank. For years, many Germans felt that the
best way to exorcise such demons was by demolishing the structure or making it a museum. But under the
Realpolitik of real estate, the German government can't afford to be too picky as it moves to its new capital,
Berlin, from Bonn. So it is converting the Reichsbank into the Foreign Ministry's new headquarters.
Beginning in November, envoys from Israel, Poland and Britain, among other nations, will meet with German
diplomats in the monumental structure, which had a bust of the Fuehrer in the lobby, friezes of idealized
ancient-Greek figures that served as a sort of pantheon of Aryan gods and gold seized from
concentration-camp victims in the basement.
As it moves east, the government is happy to exploit the fact that Hitler built good office space here. The
Foreign Ministry needs room, and the Reichsbank is one of Berlin's largest buildings. Elsewhere, Joseph
Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry will house the Labor Ministry. The Finance Ministry will take over the former
home of Hermann Goering's Luftwaffe, the air force. The Defense Ministry will get the old War Ministry
building, where the Nazis executed Count Stauffenberg after his failed attempt to assassinate Hitler.
Avi Primor, Israel's ambassador to Germany, supports the moves because they mean Germany is confronting
its history instead of suppressing it. "The buildings are part of this. It's important not to forget what they were,"
he says.
Others says the decision to move into a building like the Reichsbank, with so many ghosts, is as offensive as
wearing black jackboots. "It sends the wrong signal," says Werner Sewing, a sociology professor at Berlin's
Technical University.
The attitude harks back to the postwar era, when recycling Nazi buildings was unthinkable for the people who
rebuilt Germany. The architects who designed the government buildings in Bonn, when it became the new
postwar capital, argued that giant structures made of stone encouraged oppression, while understated
buildings with lots of glass -- a symbol of transparency -- could strengthen democracy.
But attitudes have changed. "You can also make the most catastrophic decisions in glass houses," says
Hans Kohlhoff, the architect in charge of the Reichsbank renovation.
Today's German government is comfortable with the Reichsbank move because the building is being
"democratized," in the sense that some of its fascist aspects will be obscured and some glass will be added.
Not much can be done about the outside of the sprawling five-story shoebox of tawny granite, with its row of
two-story columns marching across the front side and hundreds of windows perforating the otherwise
featureless facade. So the government is going to cover it up as much as possible by putting another building
in front of it. As for the interior, on a recent morning a crew of workers plied hammers and buzz saws as part
of a redecoration that hopes to soften the building's oppressive appearance with bright colors and green
plants in the courtyard.
Of all Berlin's existing Nazi-era buildings, the Reichsbank has the most complicated history. In February
1933, a month after Hitler took power, the bank held a contest to design a new building. The leading
architects of the day entered, including Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, two founders of the Bauhaus
school of architecture. Erich Mendelsohn, another German giant of modern architecture, was excluded for
being Jewish. "I expected as much," he wrote to a friend. Shortly afterward, Mendelsohn packed up his family
and left Germany.

Hitler, a frustrated architect himself, rejected all the plans in favor of one by the bank's in-house architect,
Heinrich Wolff, who didn't even enter the competition. Mr. Wolff designed a five-story structure with a stone
facade, a low-pitched roof and columns that evoked ancient Rome, a favorite Third Reich era.
At the 1934 ceremony to lay the cornerstone, more than 5,000 people attended as the Fuehrer offered his
salute in front of multistory swastika banners and Olympic-style torches raised on columns. Reichsbank
President Hjalmar Schacht, who went on to rid the German banking industry of Jews, made a speech.
Brownshirts helped with the construction.
The building was finished in 1940, after the war was already under way. One of its most advanced features
was in the basement, where a three-story vault would flood with water if someone tried to break in. Gold
seized from Jews and smelted into ingots was kept there. Above ground, bank officials plotted ways to
finance the Third Reich.
The war left the building largely intact. And like other prominent Nazi buildings, it fell into communist hands
after the division of Berlin. Because of its size and location, the communists used it as their headquarters.
Locals called it "Honecker's Castle" after East German leader Erich Honecker.
Then came the fall of the Berlin Wall, the decision to move the government back to Berlin and the huge need
for office space. With such a troublesome legacy, the German government initially balked at reoccupying the
Reichsbank and other Nazi buildings, worrying it might symbolize continuity with the past. But to build fresh
would cost too much. And if Nazi buildings were torn down, it would raise criticism that Germany was trying to
dodge its history.
But using the buildings raised other problems. For one, Hitler would have approved. He built for the ages,
believing that there was nothing better than a building to speak to the glories of heroic times. His architect,
Albert Speer, argued that there was no better way to inspire future generations than a building that, even in a
decaying state, retained its beauty.
Two years ago, former Building Minister Klaus Toepfer met with a Jewish group in Berlin to talk about this. In
his speech, he asked the audience whether using Nazi buildings validated Speer's position. Then he
answered his own question. "It's just the opposite," he said. Anyone who is reminded of Germany's history
will, instead of embracing totalitarianism, work to make sure it isn't repeated, he said.
Andreas Nachama, a historian who invited Mr. Toepfer to speak, says that is precisely why the government
should use Nazi buildings. "Every bureaucrat who goes into one of the Berlin buildings either has to look at
the past or look consciously away," says Mr. Nachama, who heads Berlin's Jewish community organization.
"That doesn't happen in Bonn."
The Reichsbank building was a mess when the Wall came down in 1989. Because of a glass shortage in
East Germany, windows had been bricked over and skylights covered. Routine repairs had been neglected.
But to restore the building to its original condition was impossible because that would be honoring the Nazis.
The government instead wanted to make it suitable for democracy much like it is doing with the Reichstag,
the old German parliament building that will serve as the new parliament building after the move from Bonn.
The Reichstag predates Hitler, but it was in the Reichstag that German lawmakers passed a law that put
Hitler in power. British architect Norman Foster "democratized" the building with a glass dome and a walkway
for viewers to look down on their lawmakers. An exhibit in the building details its dark history.
The government is taking similar measures with the Reichsbank because the building remains associated
with Nazis in the public mind. A few weeks ago, visitors could see the words "Epis against Nazis"
spray-painted on an outside wall. The Epis, a shortened form of Edelweiss Pirates, are members of a street
gang that fights skinheads. Foreign Ministry officials admit people will still refer to the building as the
Reichsbank long after they move in.
The ministry is using a variety of measures to exorcise or disguise the building. The most obvious is the new
building being put up smack in front of it, blocking the view of the Reichsbank to people passing on a main
street. Michael Wise, who recently wrote a book on Berlin architecture titled "Capital Dilemma," notes that the
new building will make it harder for television cameras to get a clear picture of the Nazi-era structure.
As for the Reichsbank itself, Mr. Kohlhoff, the architect doing the renovation, is giving it a lighter tone. He is
opening up bricked-over windows and giving the complex a cheerier atmosphere with rooftop gardens and
trees in the courtyard. Mr. Kohlhoff, a German architect who once taught at Cornell University, in Ithaca, N.Y.,
is lending "atmospheric freshness" to the building with color. The ceiling in the lobby will be painted sky-blue.
Every aspect of the project has been criticized, particularly within artistic circles. After a Swiss architect won
the jury competition for the new building to stand in front of the Reichsbank, with a boxy, monolithic design,
the Foreign Ministry rejected it as structurally inadequate. Others said it was just plain ugly. But the design
the ministry ultimately settled on, an airy structure with courtyards that has been likened to a Japanese

teahouse, looks a bit like a swastika from above. Foreign Ministry officials concede as much. But they and
Ivan Reimann, one of the architects who designed the new building, say the assertion that this was done
intentionally is laughable.
Then there is the art going inside the the Reichsbank. The artist whom Mr. Kohlhoff picked for the
assignment, Gerhard Merz, has been accused of making Nazi references in his works. "I'm not saying he's a
Nazi," says art critic Hans-Ernst Mittig. "But he plays around with the symbols."
Finally, Mr. Kohlhoff is himself a controversial figure. His designs often reflect classical influences, and he
isn't afraid to use stone, despite its fascistic connotations in Germany. He has repeatedly had to defend his
works in the architectural and mainstream press. Not surprisingly, his Reichsbank renovation has spurred
more debate. Mr. Sewing, the Berlin professor, takes issue with Mr. Kohlhoff's choice of chandeliers in the
building's conference room. "It looks like the 1930s," he says.
Peter Conradi, a former member of the German parliament, likes the Reichstag renovation because it alters
original features to give distance to the past. The Reichsbank renovation doesn't go far enough, he says. "It
shouldn't be reconstructed as if nothing happened," he says.
Mr. Kohlhoff counters that Mr. Conradi's position means giving up too much. He says he is tired of
accusations about having a right-wing agenda. "That's nonsense," he says.
While the work moves steadily toward a conclusion, the question about how to present the building's history
remains open. Mr. Primor, Mr. Nachama and others want the building to have plaques, exhibits or other
fixtures to tell visitors what happened. Officials under Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer have no plans other
than perhaps a booklet to give to visitors. The Berlin city government will probably put up a sidewalk plaque
that gives a short history of the building.
Mr. Kohlhoff's view is that he doesn't want a walk through the building to be an "educational tour." If people
notice design details that remind them of different periods in the building's history, that's enough. "We're
trying to start a dialogue, nothing more," he says. "When that happens, we've achieved our goal."

Brazil's Monetary Illusions -- and Ours
Brazil's Monetary Illusions -- and Ours
By Judy Shelton

Brazilian officials went into last weekend stating that they would announce their country's new
foreign-exchange policy on Monday. After the prior week's horrendous bout with money meltdown, they were
contemplating three options: (1) setting up a currency board similar to the one in neighboring Argentina that
would require one-to-one convertibility with the dollar; (2) widening the trading range for the value of the
Brazilian currency, the real, against the dollar, with the central bank intervening in the foreign-exchange
market to support the real as necessary; or (3) simply allowing the real to float freely.
The official announcement came on Monday as scheduled. Surprise, they went with floating. In truth,
however, it is difficult to distinguish the third option from the second, as the new central bank president,
Francisco Lopes, also insists that the government will intervene in an "occasional and limited form" if there
are any "disorderly" exchange-rate movements. He also announced a surprise increase in interest rates --
the prime lending rate has now been raised to 41% -- in order "to minimize excessive exchange-rate volatility
and consolidate price stability."
Some observers have hailed the plan as bold. It isn't. It isn't even a plan. It is a mix-and-match approach to
manipulating the value of the nation's money that serves the interests of government at the expense of
citizens.
Intellectually, Brazil's new policy is shamelessly muddled. If the currency is to float freely, the government
should have a strictly hands-off policy. How can the market determine the appropriate value for the real if a
significant portion of the seeming demand for the currency is actually just the Brazilian government buying up
its own money, attempting artificially to prop up its exchange rate against the dollar? By hinting that it will
support the real without specifying the trigger points for intervention, Brazil's central bank has retained its
trading-band mentality; it just isn't showing its cards to consumers or investors.
As for raising interest rates, it's clear that in a country that long ago figured out how to index costs, higher
interest rates will feed inflation rather than combat it. The higher cost of borrowing will be passed along in
the form of higher prices for goods produced. The latest move has less to do with fiscal discipline than with
trying to wheedle skeptical outsiders into holding an undependable currency.
Even worse, the new monetary policy is morally bankrupt. Brazil's inflation rate in 1993 was 2,700%. The
Real Plan was adopted the following year as a radical measure to gain some semblance of economic sanity
by closely tying the value of the national currency to the dollar. The plan worked -- Brazil's inflation rate was
1.5% last year -- and a grateful citizenry re-elected President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was granted
near-hero status for making good on his promise to put the nation on a sound monetary footing.
Of course, political leaders routinely break promises. And the decision to sacrifice the credibility of the real
was no doubt painful for Mr. Cardoso. But it was clearly even more painful for Gustavo Franco, the former
central bank president, who strongly resisted devaluation in the face of attacks by businessmen, trade
unions and politicians -- before finally succumbing to pressure to resign. "People do not realize the extent of
the stress and solitude that comes from the defense of principles and policies directed at the majority, which
are opposed by powerful interests." he said.
Speaking of powerful interests, where does the International Monetary Fund figure in all this? IMF authorities,
together with U.S. Treasury officials, were initially miffed by Brazil's move to floating rates. After all, the whole
premise behind the $41.5 billion loan package arranged for Brazil in November was to provide conspicuously
sufficient reserves to intimidate speculators from making a run on the real. When they did anyway, cashing
out $4 billion worth in three days, the deterrent value of the financial war chest was obviously shot.
Not to worry. The ultimate enabler, the IMF quickly reconciled itself to being disregarded and moved to
embrace Brazil's new policy. After a weekend of meetings in Washington, IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus declared he was "satisfied" with Finance Minister Pedro Malan's "useful clarification" of Brazil's

objectives. This even though the 22% decline in the value of the real since last week means it will be that
much harder for private companies and the Brazilian government itself to pay back dollar-denominated debts.
What's more, the devaluation will undoubtedly worsen the recession that had already been projected.
What is truly worrisome is that the very exercise in monetary futility conducted by Brazil in global currency
markets last week -- attempting to stabilize exchange rates within a defined trading range through
central-bank intervention (or the threat of it) -- is now being pursued at the global level, one suspects with
the blessings of the IMF. Keizo Obuchi, Japan's prime minister, has been meeting with his counterparts in
Europe to enlist them in his push for "tripartite cooperation" between Japan, Europe and the U.S. to stabilize
exchange rates among the yen, euro and dollar through active government management.
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroe-der, already predisposed toward the concept of exchange rate "target
zones" promoted by his outspoken finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, is now suggesting that such an
arrangement should be seriously discussed at the scheduled June economic summit of the Group of Seven in
Cologne. "The basic principle that laissez-faire is not a correct policy for these markets has established itself,"
according to Mr. Schroeder, who asserts there is common agreement among the major powers on this point.
President Clinton's reference to the upcoming summit in his State of the Union speech, coupled with
proposals of his own for a new international financial architecture steeped in the Keynesian tradition of
government-knows-best solutions, provides an eerie echo on the global stage.
There is nothing wrong in wanting to put a human face on capitalism. But it should be the face of an
entrepreneur, not a bureaucrat. Entrepreneurs need money that functions as a meaningful unit of account
and a reliable store of value. The problem with schemes that seek to impart integrity to money through the
pronouncements and manipulations of government authorities -- including "crawling peg" approaches or other
complex formulas that fall into the oxymoronic category of managed float regimes -- is that they are based on
the rule of men, not the rule of law. They are thus vulnerable to political expediency.
Contrast the notion of managed exchange rates, trading bands and dirty floats with the straightforward
approach to money taken by Argentina. In 1991, led by former Minister of the Economy Domingo Cavallo,
Argentina passed a convertibility law that requires every new unit of money to be backed 100% by
currency-board holdings of U.S. dollars. Citizens can exchange pesos for dollars on a one-for-one basis; they
are interchangeable. Notice the critical difference? Individuals are empowered by the right to convert their
money at a fixed rate into a currency they trust. They are not passive victims of government fallibility in
monetary matters.
Instead of the keep-'em-guessing nature of discretionary monetary authority, as exercised by most
governments in the name of preserving "flexibility," Argentina has opted to permit its citizens to make
economic decisions free from monetary illusion. No stimulating of the economy through inflation, no
improving the "competitiveness" of exports through currency devaluation. Just money that works.
In comparison, for all the good accomplished in Brazil over the 4u years it enjoyed a stable currency, in the
end the Real Plan proved not radical enough. Certainly not as radical as transferring power away from
government and granting it to private individuals, who, after all, are the economic agents of productive
growth. Convertibility conveys choice -- the ultimate guarantor of democratic capitalism.
Now if only we could make the dollar as good as gold. Then we could start talking seriously about a global
monetary system based on fixed exchange rates.

Year 2000 Prompts a Shift To Gold by Some Investors

Robert McKeeman isn't a typical gun-and-bunker kind of guy.
But the 44-year-old Harvard Business School graduate has one thing in common with hard-core survivalists:
He recently upped his investment in precious metals because of the year-2000 problem.
Mr. McKeeman is entirely reasonable when he discusses the shift in his investments: It is a hedge, says the
Santa Rosa Beach, Fla., resident, something to protect his investments in case there are problems in the
financial markets. Specifically, he has increased the proportion of his portfolio allocated to gold and
gold-mining stocks to 20% from 5%.
"The rest of the world isn't taking the issue seriously," he says, noting that he arrived at that conclusion after
observing some other firms' Y2K preparations through his job. And while a spate of recent publicity for the
problem has heartened him, he says, "It's not going to be the end of the world, but it won't have zero effects
either."
That is a far cry from the sentiments of the people in 999, when the still-scattered peoples of Europe awaited
1000 in genuine fear of an apocalypse. But the old concern has an echo in the new, technological worry. And
faced with Y2K, ordinary people, many of whom work in high-tech industries, are joining the more paranoid in
turning part of their portfolios over to gold and other precious metals.
The year-2000 problem occurs when older computers that are programmed for dates with two digits
representing the year malfunction or shut down. While they now read "99" as 1999, for example, they could
interpret Jan. 1, 2000, as the year 1900.
There aren't any statistics available on how many investors are taking this tack, but perhaps it isn't just
coincidence that the U.S. Mint, which makes bullion coins from gold, silver and platinum, had a record year in
1998, selling more than 1.8 million ounces of gold American Eagle coins, the most since the program's
frenzied launch in 1986. And gold isn't the only coin selling well. The mint temporarily has had to stop making
its one-ounce silver coin because the unusual level of demand has overwhelmed manufacturing capacity at
the firms that supply the mint with blank coins.
Officials at Blanchard & Co., the country's biggest seller of investment-grade coins, say their business, too, is
benefiting. Christopher Holton, director of marketing, estimates between 20% and 25% of the New Orleans
firm's 112,000 individual-investor clients expressed concerns about Y2K last year. Since the beginning of
January, which brought many year-2000-related stories on television and in newspapers, he says, Blanchard
account executives report that 80% of the clients they talk to are worried about the computer problem. The
company recommends clients put 10% of total assets in gold, rare gold coins and other hard assets.
None of this has done much for precious-metals prices. In the past two years alone, the price of gold has
fallen more than $120 an ounce to historically low levels. The February futures price at the New York
Mercantile Exchange's Comex division settled at $287.50 an ounce yesterday, near its lowest level in
decades.
Gold buying related to the year 2000 is largely an American phenomenon, says Philip Klapwijk, managing
director at Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd., London. Most global gold traders are concerned instead with
the market's large issues, such as central-bank sales and lending of gold. Meanwhile, silver and platinum
prices, while not as weak as gold, haven't enjoyed any Y2K-related spikes either. Some analysts, aware of
year-2000-related gold buying, say Y2K investors, ironically, could spark further preciousmetals bear markets
if and when the problem is averted and investors turn around and sell.

"What we may find is that if you get into the end of January or February 2000 and nothing happens, you're
going to get a lot of that [Y2K] gold sold back into the market," says James Steel, a commodity analyst with
Refco Inc. in New York. But Mr. Steel says he knows a lot of year-2000-related gold buyers in Silicon Valley.
"That's like when all the doctors quit smoking. You knew it was really bad," he says.
He also points to the relatively high open interest, or number of open trading positions, in December 1999 call
options on gold at the Nymex. (Call options give their owners the right to buy the underlying commodity at a
specified price.) Exchange statistics show total open interest in the December calls at 99,512 contracts as of
Jan. 15, compared with 64,633 contracts for June 1999 calls and 31,856 contracts for June 2000 calls. Mr.
Steel says, "In a large measure, that's attributable to Y2K buying."
Options players aside, many of the Y2K precious-metals investors are part of the group that is buying
generators and stockpiling food. They say precious metals could serve as a stop-gap currency if networks fail
and people can't draw on their bank accounts with checks or ATM cards.
Julie Ehlers, a 31-year-old West Orange, N.J., housewife and former investment adviser, says she has
bought krugerrands, South Africa's gold bullion coins, and shifted most of her 401(k) plan into short-term
Treasury bills and a precious-metals fund. Gold is actually more attractive because it is at a historic low, she
says. If the investment proves unnecessary, she says, "all I'll have lost will be some interest at a bank, at
most. In some of the really ridiculous [Y2K] scenarios, this could save my life. That would be bizarre and
unlikely." But, she adds, "I'm spending less on this than on fire insurance."
In other commodity markets:
LUMBER: A surprisingly strong U.S. housing report helped to send Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures to
their highest level in 16 months, analysts and traders said. U.S. housing starts hit an 11-year high in
December, rising 3.5% in the month to an annual rate of 1.72 million units, the Commerce Department
reported. Economists had expected a more modest rise of about 1%. The feverish pace of the U.S. housing
market points to continued strong demand in a rapidly tightening lumber market, analysts said.
The CME's front-month March contract surged $10, its exchange-imposed daily limit, at the opening
yesterday in response to the housing report and held those gains to close at $348.70 per thousand board
feet, its highest level ever and the highest close for a nearby contract since September 1997. The May
contract rose its $10 limit, closing at $334 per thousand board feet.
In addition to the housing data, the market got a lift from a rallying cash market. Random Lengths, a Eugene,
Ore., newsletter considered the industry's bible for cash pricing, printed a benchmark cash price of $316 per
thousand board feet in its midweek report, up $8 from Friday and up $13 from a week ago. But by the day's
end, cash lumber sold for about $325 at the mill level, with some producers asking as much as $338, traders
said.
Yesterday was the second straight day in which March futures closed up their daily limit, as supply worries
intensify. "There's a whiff of panic in the air," said Graham Dallimore, vice president at Global Futures Corp.
in Vancouver, British Columbia.
SUGAR: World raw sugar futures on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange unit of the New York Board of
Trade fell, as speculative commodity funds continued the selling they began during Tuesday's fall. The March
contract dropped 0.17 cent to 7.52 cents a pound. Continued uncertainty about the latest economic upheaval
in Brazil, speculation that Russia won't be as big a buyer as hoped, and weakening premiums for Thai raw
sugar are contributing to the market's gloomy tone, said Anthony Compagnino, a trader with East Coast
Options Services Inc. in New York.
HOGS: Lean hog futures and pork belly futures rose by their limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to
talk of export business that couldn't be confirmed. The February hog contract rose two cents to 40.82 cents a
pound. "The hogs and the bellies traded on more rumor than fact," said Chuck Levitt, analyst with Alaron
Trading Corp. in Chicago. "The trade looked at stories indicating that Japan might be in the market for some
less expensive pork cuts, like bellies."

PEABODY, Mass. -- The stench of death rises from 16-foot-high piles of cow bones chopped up into
popcorn-size nuggets. Frank T. Angelakis, perched on a catwalk, grabs a fistful, rubs the pieces between his
fingers and grimaces.
"Not the best stuff," Mr. Angelakis says. "It's hard enough. Not porous. But it feels greasy."
This place of decay is actually part of Eastman Kodak Co., which quietly turns the stuff of marrow into
memories. Here, Mr. Angelakis is known as the Bone Man. Or Bonehead. His real title is bone-quality
coordinator, and he is in charge of making sure everything is rock solid with the 80 million pounds of bovine
skeleton that Kodak buys annually from slaughterhouses. The company turns the bones into gelatin used to
manufacture film.
Who knew that bones were used in film? "I hadn't a clue," says Paula Lerner, a professional photographer in
Boston.
It's unusual that such a plant could continue to exist at Kodak which, like many firms, has learned to contract
out functions that aren't a picture-perfect fit. Already, Kodak has farmed out its cafeteria and plant-security
operations, and may do the same with its painting and sheet-metal divisions. The company has also seriously
considered selling the bone works, known as Eastman Gelatine Corp. To survive, the ivy-covered plant is
learning to cut costs as close to the bone as possible.
"This is probably the biggest leadership challenge I've had," says Eastman Gelatine's general manager,
Wayne C. Jones. "We've scratched and clawed for pennies." Kodak is requiring plant management to find
double-digit cost savings annually, which it did -- barely -- with a 10% cut last year. About 20% of its work
force, or 50 people, have been laid off. Overall, Kodak has eliminated more than 10,000 employees and
slashed about $730 million in costs to be more competitive and improve the bottom line. But pressure is on to
slash more. Last week, the company's stock slid when its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.
The bone plant is feeling it from all sides. The average market price of cow bone, the plant's raw material, has
risen 25% in the past two years to about $400 a ton, driven by soaring demand for gelatin, now used in
everything from yogurt to vitamin-pill gel caps. There's something of a "frenzy for cattle bone," says Michael
Rempe, vice president of byproducts at Excel Corp. of Wichita, Kan., a major beef processor.
Kodak Founder George Eastman founded the plant in 1930 to have better control over the gel-making. He
had nearly been ruined after buying a batch of bones from cattle fed with mustard seed, causing his gel to
overexpose the film before pictures were taken.
Today, in this remote corner of Kodak's international empire, 400 miles from headquarters in Rochester, N.Y.,
the goateed Mr. Angelakis contemplates bovine economies in his cramped, fluorescent-lit office. Longhorns
graze on his computer screen-saver. A femur sticks out of a coffee cup. He jots notes on cow stationery. "I'm
not obsessed," he insists.
When the slaughterhouse deliveries arrive by rail in Peabody, just a few feet from his office, the bone chips
click along a conveyor belt to bubbling vats of hydrochloric acid. There, the bone percolates for a week to
remove calcium and phosphate minerals, which are sold as feed and fertilizer. It is then soaked in a murky
lime solution for about eight weeks, where it liquefies and is pumped through a series of water tanks and
filters, transforming into a syrupy state before it is cooled, like Jell-O in the refrigerator. Then it is dried,
ground into a powder and trucked to Kodak headquarters, where it is mixed with other chemicals to create a
photo-sensitive emulsion on strips of film.

It is a complicated process that can be slowed down by a screwy bone. (Not all bones are created equal.
Male is better than female; young is better than old; longer is better than short; drier is better than wet.) To
keep them coming in as bone-dry as possible, Mr. Angelakis, who monitors for grease, sinew and other
unwanted remnants, is pushing reluctant suppliers into buying expensive machinery that precleans the bone
before it is shipped. If the suppliers deliver greasy bones, which cost more to process, he exacts financial
penalties.
Two years ago, for example, Mr. Angelakis devised an incentive program for Kodak's main bone supplier,
Monfort Inc. of Greeley, Colo. If Monfort doesn't meet quality goals such as reducing grease and delivering
nuggets of the right size, it pays Kodak a penalty of up to tens of thousands of dollars. If the supplier meets
the goals, it gets a bonus of a similar amount. In the first year, Monfort paid a penalty, which encouraged the
supplier to get a better centrifuge-a piece of equipment that can cost up to $250,000-to remove grease.
Every quarter, Mr. Angelakis flies to Colorado and uses an overhead projector to show Monfort officials the
bone-quality performance of its various plants, ranked on such measures as moisture levels and the yield of
bone per head of cattle. "I'm trying to motivate everybody to be at the top," he says. Beyond bragging rights
and cash incentives, the winner gets a wood plaque with brass plates. "It's like the heavyweight belt," Mr.
Angelakis says.
The bone-to-gelatin process once created a lot of waste -- about two million to three million pounds of crusty,
mushy residue at the bottom of kettles that had to be thrown away each year. But as there is money to be
made in bones, there is money to be made in sludge. Alarmed by the rising costs of disposal, Mr. Jones, the
plant manager, came up with what he calls his "garbage-to-gold strategy" -- pumping the muck out of the
kettles by machine and turning it into edible gel that could be sold to food makers. For reasons that churn the
stomach, this sort of gel needs to be less pure than the kind used in film.
The result: The plant was able to add about 20% to gel production and sell it to third parties. Now the plant
has refined the process enough that it can use more than half of the recycled gel for making film. "It went from
a liability to an advantage," Mr. Jones says.
Such gains were fine, but the bone works was still bedeviled by rising bone prices. The number of
slaughterers equipped to produce chips was limited, and as demand for bone rose, "they had us," says Mr.
Jones. "We couldn't say no. We'd just say, 'How much?"'
But a year ago, he hired a consultant who found a company that handled dead cows and wasn't selling bone:
Anamax Corp., a food-waste recycling business in Green Bay, Wis. Kodak taught Anamax how to separate
cattle meat from bone, clean it and sell it at a lower price than current suppliers, thus giving the plant leverage
with its other bone dealers. Most of them agreed to price cuts late in the year.
As for other attempts to diversify sourcing, Kodak was able to grow genetically engineered bone in the lab --
but it proved too expensive. Pig bones are too greasy, chicken bones too small. "People say, 'Why can't you
just use rat tails?"' says Mr. Jones. "But there's not enough of them."

After 18 months of watching one currency after another succumb to global speculators, Argentina is talking
about taking the ultimate step: getting out of the national currency business altogether.
President Carlos Menem is asking his finance ministry to study the wisdom of forcing Argentines to rely
exclusively on the U.S. dollar for everything from paying for groceries to making mortgage payments.
To Americans, junking one of the most tangible symbols of nationhood is as unimaginable as flying another
nation's flag over the Capitol. But then, few Americans can comprehend the Argentines' horror of ever again
experiencing the hyperinflation of the late 1980s, and their willingness to pay a heavy price -- economically
and in national pride -- to avoid a recurrence.
President Menem's suggestion and the global financial crisis that prompted it highlight the shortcomings of
the existing hodgepodge of currency arrangements. Countries such as Brazil, which had hoped neither to fix
its currency rigidly to the dollar nor to let it float freely, have discovered that it may be impossible to maintain
the middle ground. Brazil failed to prevent the market from pushing its currency outside of a set range, and
now appears to be doing what Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia have had to do: letting the markets move
their currencies freely.
The allure of the other extreme is demonstrated in Europe, where Germany, France and nine other countries
this month formally began replacing their national currencies with the euro. "If European Monetary Union
succeeds, there probably will be a shift toward . . . more currency unions and fewer currencies," Stanley
Fischer, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, predicted earlier this month.
Having rigidly fixed the peso to the dollar and neutered its central bank, Argentina already has subjected
itself to all the economic disadvantages of lashing its economy to the U.S. and the Federal Reserve.
Argentina's central bank cannot cut interest rates to resist recession, and it cannot serve as a lender of last
resort to its banking system. That doesn't much matter to the Fed, given that it already has to worry about the
international ramifications of anything it does.
"It's a small nuisance to have people `central bank' to us as long as they decide that we make the
monetary-policy decisions and don't care about them," says Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist
and former Fed vice chair.
In fact, a decision by Argentina to declare the dollar its sole currency would make surprisingly little difference
to the U.S. Already, two-thirds of the $472 billion of U.S. currency in existence circulates outside U.S.
borders. That hasn't posed many problems for the Fed, which manages the money supply more by buying
and selling Treasury bills than by distributing currency. Technically, all the Argentine pesos on bank ledgers
and the like would instantly become U.S. dollars, but that wouldn't matter much to the supply and demand for
credit in the U.S., the Fed's primary concern.
Still, very few countries make the dollar their only currency. Panama adopted the dollar in 1904, and has
enjoyed one of the lowest inflation rates in Latin American for nearly a century as a result. The down side, of
course, is that Panama-like Argentina with its fixed exchange rate-is hostage to U.S. Fed decisions but has
no say in Fed policy. "It would be only a slight exaggeration to compare Panama's control over its money
supply to that of New Jersey's," says Fernando Monfredo, former administrator of the Panama Canal
Commission.
And Panama is vulnerable in ways that other small countries aren't: In 1988, the U.S. tried to block the flow of
new greenbacks to Panama to weaken Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. Panamanians got by with ratty,
worn-out bills, but a scarcity of dollars contributed to chaos and deep recession. (In 1995, faced with heavy

demand for physical dollar bills after Mexico devalued its peso, Argentina asked the U.S. Treasury for a
speedy shipment of $400 million in cash.)
For the U.S., the major logistical problem that would be posed by Argentina's adopting the dollar would be
exporting paper, but even that is manageable. The Fed's regional banks already ship tons of $100 bills to
other countries, usually working through commercial banks. Supplying Argentina would be relatively easy.
The country has about $16 billion of peso notes and coins in circulation today. The Treasury's Bureau of
Printing and Engraving this year plans to produce 11.4 billion new bills worth $261.5 billion.
Economically, the U.S. benefits modestly from the widespread use of its currency abroad. To get dollars from
the U.S., foreigners have to trade something of value -- marks, gold, oil, tequila. In return, the foreigners get
a piece of paper that costs four cents to manufacture. This swap amounts to an interest-free loan to the U.S.
government. It saves the U.S. government about $14 billion in interest payments, roughly the size of the total
U.S. foreign-aid budget.
If Argentina, which now holds interest-bearing U.S. Treasury bills, were to rely exclusively on the dollar, it
would have to buy paper currency (on which the U.S. pays no interest) by exchanging $16 billion worth of
Treasury bills (on which it does pay interest). That would save the U.S. another $750 million or so in interest
costs.
Argentina's history makes talk of adopting the U.S. dollar as its own more than just idle chatter. Disgusted by
its central bank's inability to prevent hyperinflation, Argentina eight years ago put the central bank out of the
business of printing money, created a new peso worth $1 each and passed a "currency board" law requiring
the government to hold enough dollars in reserves so that every peso can be exchanged for a U.S. dollar.
Inflation went from a peak of 5,000% in 1989 to roughly 1% today, an achievement as popular in Argentina
as a World Cup victory in soccer.
The walls of El Portugues, a Buenos Aires steakhouse, offer a quick course in the country's sorry economic
history. Framed on the wall are one-million-peso bills from the late 1980s that are worthless today, a
1,000-peso bill stamped "1 austral" on its face from an unsuccessful 1985 attempt to stabilize the currency,
and the austral bills themselves, bitter reminders of the hyperinflation of the late 1980s.
Mariano Gutierrez-Walker, the restaurant's 28-year-old manager, says it does seem strange to think of using
American dimes in Argentina. "But," he says, pointing to one of the framed bills on the wall, "I used to buy
things with this bill here and it doesn't even exist anymore."
Argentina's economy minister, Roque Fernandez, emphasized Friday that the notion of dollarizing the
economy was, for now, only being studied and that no immediate action was planned. But Mr. Menem's
earlier comment was no presidential slip of the tongue. Pablo Guidotti, the vice minister of economy who will
lead the inquiry, says, "This has been something we have been discussing with the U.S. Treasury since last
year." U.S. officials confirm that.
"One way to reduce volatility is for the world to converge to fewer currencies," Mr. Guidotti adds. "For us, it is
becoming clear that having a currency that is not a reserve currency has more costs than benefits."
Today, the U.S. dollar circulates alongside the peso in Argentina in the economic equivalent of a bilingual
society. Most automated teller machines give customers a choice of dollars or pesos when they make
withdrawals, spitting out crisp $50 or $100 bills to those who want them. Bank customers are asked, "Dollars
or pesos?" when they open an account or borrow money. About 54% of Argentine bank deposits and 63% of
loans are in dollars.
All government transactions, including tax payments, are still denominated in pesos, as are most salaries.
Cab drivers and shop clerks sometimes flinch when handed a U.S. bill instead of the more colorful Argentine
bills, such as the purple 100-peso note. But they accept the greenbacks. At the end of the business day,
roughly 5% of the money in the cash drawer in a store in Buenos Aires is U.S. currency; about 10% of the
$40,000 in cash that El Portugues collects every weekend is U.S. currency.
But change is always given in pesos, and no U.S. coins circulate. Shipping coins from the U.S. is costlier than
shipping bills. That may pose one problem in completely eliminating the peso. Panama solved it by minting
coins of its own while relying on U.S. dollar bills.
The fixed-rate, two-currency system is reasonably popular in Argentina, but the collapse of the currency in
Brazil, which buys 30% of Argentine exports, calls into question the country's ability to maintain the fixed
exchange rate.
With popular support, Mr. Menem insists he will avoid devaluation at all costs. But a tangible sign of market
doubts shows up in interest rates. Argentine banks lend each other money in both dollars and pesos. At the
beginning of last week, the interest rate on peso loans was about half a percentage point higher than the rate

--- Page 23 ---
Page 23 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
on dollar loans; that difference was, in effect, the fee lenders charged for taking the risk that the peso might
be devalued. At the end of last week, the spread had doubled to a full percentage point. Argentine officials
say dollarizing would eliminate that gap and might help reduce the level of interest rates by boosting global
investor confidence in Argentina.
Mr. Menem's latest suggestion isn't universally welcomed in Argentina because many believe the point of
pegging the peso to the dollar was to restore confidence in the national currency, not to destroy it.
"Dollarization . . . throws out the window all the effort after hyperinflation to restore confidence in the peso,"
Argentine newspaper columnist Julio Nudler wrote over the weekend. "It's as if Menem is now saying that all
this effort was absurd, and that it would have made more sense to adopt the dollar in 1990."
Mr. Menem's talk of embracing the U.S. dollar was carefully timed. It was a way to underscore Argentina's
resolve to avoid devaluation by sparking conversation about going in the opposite direction and making
devaluation even more difficult. But the markets won't long be impressed by idle rhetoric. Talking about the
merits of using the dollar may create expectations in the markets that Argentina will actually do so; if it
doesn't, fears of devaluation may spread.
"If you're really, really committed to the currency board, why not go all the way and remove any lingering
doubt? That's the argument," says Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology international
economist.
Actually, Mr. Menem has something more ambitious in mind. Early last year, he began talking publicly about
a single currency for South America, a notion that has never drawn much support in Brazil and draws ridicule
in Argentina from opposition politicians.
"The reason he is proposing the dollar," says economist Sebastian Edwards, a Latin American specialist at
the University of California at Los Angeles, "is that Brazil would never contemplate using the Argentine peso.
Brazil believes that in the future, maybe there ought to be four currency blocs: the dollar, the yen, the euro
and the Brazilian currency."
Unlike many of its neighbors, Argentina, by adopting a fixed exchange rate, already has sacrificed control
over its money supply; while that has snuffed inflation, there's plenty of skepticism among non-Argentine
economists about the wisdom of tying the nation's fortunes to Fed policy. "The problem for Argentina is that
the case for a dollar peg is itself not so strong," says MIT's Mr. Krugman. "Argentina is a long way from the
U.S. and is subject to all sorts of idiosyncratic shocks-like recessions and devaluations in Brazil. Being tied to
U.S. monetary policy is not exactly perfect."
Indeed, it might make more sense to dollarize the Mexican economy. After all, the country shares a border
with the U.S. and does 80% of its trade with its North American neighbors. People of Mexican descent in the
U.S. send dollars home, and Mexican residents have dollar-denominated bank accounts. Prices for
computers, houses and other big-ticket items often are quoted in dollars.
After The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Mexican authorities were privately promoting a debate
over replacing the freely floating peso with a currency securely fixed to the dollar, a Mexico City radio station
did an impromptu poll. By six-to-one, several thousand callers favored a dollar-backed currency. But even
that is years away, and full-scale dollarization is a long way from being a politically viable possibility.
So if any country is going to adopt the dollar in the next few years, it probably will be Argentina.
If it does so, there may be a silver lining for the U.S. Argentina doesn't have a one-peso note; it uses a
one-peso coin. The country might offer a market for the unsuccessful Susan B. Anthony dollar coin. Hundreds
of millions of the quarter-size coins were produced by the U.S. Mint between 1979 and 1981, but virtually
none of them actually circulate.

As a hair and makeup artist in New York's cutthroat beauty market, Mitchell Behr has faced down imperious
fashion editors, strong-willed models and demanding clients on their worst-hair days. But Mr. Behr's
confidence shrivels when it comes to some truly intimidating figures: three members of his book club.
"They are the meanest women I have ever met," says Mr. Behr, whose Long Island book group just recently
disbanded. "They're sarcastic and vicious and talk in Morse code among themselves." The women made Mr.
Behr terrified to admit he didn't understand certain books, and they joked about giving dish-washing duty to
members who didn't finish the monthly selection. "I'd never, ever, ever go without reading the book," says Mr.
Behr. "It's like being back in school again."
Out there among America's readers, it isn't always Oprah's book club. While the industry that has sprung up
around book clubs is booming -- with books on forming book groups, "facilitators" paid to lead them and
published guides to decipher bestsellers -- book groups themselves are undergoing a decided change in
character. No longer just friendly social gatherings with a vague continuing-education agenda, many of
today's book groups have become literary pressure cookers, marked by aggressive intellectual
one-upmanship and unabashed social skirmishing. In living rooms and bookshops across the country, clubs
are frazzling under the stress, giving rise to a whole new profession: the book-group therapist. What started
as rediscovery of the literary life has, for some, disintegrated into the tyranny of the book group.
Part of the problem is sheer numbers. With so many people joining book groups, breakdowns are inevitable.
In 1990, Barnes & Noble had just one in-store book group; now all of its 500 stores host at least one. The two
Tattered Cover megabookstores in Denver employ a full-time staffer to advise more than 400 groups in the
area. The Chicago-based Association of Book Group Readers and Leaders (ABGRL), founded in 1994, now
has 1,000 members nationwide.
Although clubs like these have the power to turn hardback sleepers like "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood" into paperback bestsellers, there are signs that the country's collective book-group morale is
breaking down. Readers who just a few years ago were seduced by the prestige of belonging to a book group
are suddenly discovering they don't want their book choices dictated by others. Many can't stand the
countless literary battles with alpha moms and type-A personalities. Some members seem to care less about
reading than about getting in with the right crowd.
"It's become a joke," says Rachel Jacobsohn, president of the ABGRL, who was just hired to improve group
dynamics and deal with troublemakers in clubs sponsored by Illinois libraries. "How do you get rid of bad
apples? Do you send out a questionaire? Do you have a hazing?"
In a culture where contentious television personalities and overzealous prosecutors have ratcheted up the
decibels of debate, it is no surprise that book groups have also grown acrimonious. Fifty years ago, times
were gentler. Many book clubs in that day were inspired by the Chicago-based Great Books Foundation, a
nonprofit organization devoted to the promotion of reading. The foundation was known for its nine-year
reading cycle of authors such as Homer, Shakespeare and Plato. At the foundation's peak in the early 1960s,
it had 40,000 participants who bought their excerpts in boxed sets and engaged in Socratic dialogue with
leaders who had completed training seminars. Today, the foundation's membership has dropped to between
15,000 and 20,000, according to Gary Schoepfel, director of adult programs. "Now people want to pick and
choose their own books," he says.
They also want a looser organization in their book groups -- a condition that can give rise to book tyrants.
Joan Steinberg, a Bethlehem, Pa., housewife, belongs to a club of women who know each other through a
local bookstore. The club's meetings are dominated by one woman "who knows everything about the authors
and everything about the books, and has the right answers," complains Mrs. Steinberg. This person rules by

fiat, swatting away the opinions of others with an attitude of "you can think that but you're wrong," says Mrs.
Steinberg. The members are hesitant to challenge the woman because she seems well-read and
opinionated.
Adding insult to injury, "the books she picks we hate," says Mrs. Steinberg. "She's the only one who
understands them." Recent offenders: books by British authors Virginia Woolf and Kate Atkinson. Worst of all,
for one recent meeting, the would-be leader didn't even show up. "That was the kicker," says Mrs. Steinberg.
"You had a roomful of women who hated the book and no one there to defend it. We wouldn't mind if she
wouldn't show up more often, but I'm sure she will."
By providing an open forum for people with arcane literary theories, book-group discussions often leave
members with highbrow headaches and personal grudges. Mr. Behr, the New York stylist, says his group's
examination of "Philistines at the Hedgerow," a book about social life on Long Island, devolved into a
screaming match about anti-Semitism, one of the book's themes. "It almost got to the point where there could
have been a fight," says Mr. Behr. The stylist knew he had gone too far when he told a fellow member "you
are not as ignorant as you sound."
Lisa Wells, a New York production artist, complains that her group's two-hour discussion of "Lolita" focused
narrowly on Lolita's complicity, a point Ms. Wells finds irrelevant. "I felt we wasted a couple of hours," she
says. Ms. Wells adds that this is a recurring phenomenon in her group. One member would always "latch
onto one of these points and another person would start to argue and that would be the whole discussion,"
she says.
Of course, you don't have to re-read "The Prince" to figure out how to depose a book-club tyrant. When one
woman in Ms. Wells's club kept strong-arming the discussion, for example, the group simply took the low
road. "We stopped calling her" to tell her about meeting times, she says.
More diplomatic approaches don't always work, says Virginia Valentine, who advises book-club patrons of the
Tattered Cover. For example, when she was approached by a local group whose sessions were being
railroaded by a strong-willed therapist, Ms. Valentine told them to "bring her in." But the private workout
session -- also attended by the member who brought the therapist into the group -- was "awkward," says Ms.
Valentine. Frustrated, the original member, not the therapist, dropped out of the group.
The easiest way to keep the peace may be to aspire for less. That is the hallmark of so-called book-report
clubs, in which one member reads the assigned book and simply reviews it orally, Cliffs Notes-style, for
everyone else. Catherine Gaines, a member of a book-report group in Orlando, Fla., says the arrangement is
ideal for less-literary types, like herself. "I'm not much of a reader, but I'll listen and talk to anyone," says Mrs.
Gaines, who once showed up with a bottle of vodka to review a book on Absolut's advertising strategy.
Although Mrs. Gaines says her group did manage to dig through "The Bridges of Madison County," a more
typical get-together involves nonfiction bestsellers. Recently, one member covered the Julia Child biography,
supplementing the presentation with a sampling of her pies and a clip from "Saturday Night Live" parodying
the cooking doyenne. "This ain't highbrow," Mrs. Gaines says, "We're not a bunch of literary majors."
Sometimes the simple process of picking a book every month sets members against each other. Journalist
Janet Ozzard says her New York book group fell apart a few years ago because of mutually exclusive
reading agendas. "One side of the group wanted to read American modern fiction, and the other wanted to do
the 600-page Russian novels they didn't read in college," explains Ms. Ozzard, who now lives in Paris. She
recalls one of the group's last meetings, when, in a fit of indecision, all six women repaired to Barnes & Noble
for inspiration. But cruising the aisles didn't help. To break the deadlock, each member wrote down two
selections on paper ripped from Ms.Ozzard's Filofax. With the folded slips cupped in her palms, Ms. Ozzard
approached "a total stranger and asked him to pick." The winner was "a horrible Jane Smiley book, one she
wrote 100 years ago," sniffs Ms. Ozzard. The group disbanded soon thereafter.
Another problem is that many people don't realize how much time is required for preparation and how difficult
it can be to discuss books intelligently. "It's not as easy as it looks," says the Tattered Cover's Ms. Valentine.
"It's easy to say, `Oh, I want a book club,' but it's not so easy to keep it up. It takes drive to finish a book." Ms.
Valentine says discussion guides put out by publishing houses are improving the quality of dialogue in some
groups. But such aids are of little use when members don't even bother to read the book. Ms. Wells, the
production artist, says one woman in her group frequently attends having read a book other than the selected
title. "When I confronted her, she said, `Yeah, you're right, I don't care about book club, but I don't want to be
left out,'" says Ms. Wells.
Such fractiousness has been a gold mine for book-group facilitators. Often ex-English teachers or Ph.D.s in
literature, these "professionals" are paid as much as $400 a session to choose a group's reading list, come
up with thought-provoking questions and keep testy members away from each others' throats. Facilitators
who go through the Great Books Foundation training workshop, for example, are unpaid but schooled in such

topics as "crowd control, how to talk to the subject and how to talk about the book instead of what our
grandchildren did last weekend," says Mr. Schoepfel, the director of adult programs.
While facilitators have been around for years, they are increasingly being called on not just to lead, but to
doctor ailing groups. Over the summer, Ms. Jacobsohn, the ABGRL president, says she was called in to
counsel three "groups in crisis" and spent "hours and hours" on group therapy. Carol Benet, a facilitator who
lives in Belvedere, Calif., says she has noticed a stepped-up commitment among members of the clubs she
assists. "When people pay for these things, they're much more serious about going and reading," say Ms.
Benet.
Mr. Behr, the New York hair stylist, tried a subtler form of therapy on the cliquish trio of women in his group.
In November, when it was his turn to choose a title, he selected "A Return to Innocence: Philosophical
Guidance in an Age of Cynicism," a book about "spirituality and kindness," he says. "I wanted to give [the
women] a message."
A few days before the meeting, however, the women balked: All three left voice mails saying they hadn't read
the book and weren't coming. Since then, the group hasn't had a single meeting, and the members have
barely spoken to one another. "It looks like book group isn't any more," Mr. Behr says.

Book-Group Favorites
`The Reader' by Bernhard Schlink
This novel, about a young man's affair with an older woman in Nazi
Germany, appeals to clubs because it combines sex and weighty themes.
`Snow Falling on Cedars' by David Guterson
This novel has the elements of a book-club hit. It's a mystery paired
with an interesting historical topic, the treatment of
Japanese-Americans during WWII.
`In Defense of Elitism' by William A. Henry
Not ideal for politically correct book groups. "You learn a lot about
other people's values," says a member of a Bethlehem, Pa., group.
`The Sparrow' by Mary Doria Russell
Sci-fi for the spiritually inclined, this book tends to prompt
ponderous chatter about topics such as "the meaning of God" and "how
God intervenes in your life."
`Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'
by Rebecca Wells
Readers either love it for celebrating sisterhood or deride it as
ersatz. Book clubs made it a bestseller.
`Little Altars Everywhere' by Rebecca Wells
Prequel to the Ya-Yas. Snapped up by groups that loved them.
`The Poisonwood Bible' by Barbara Kingsolver
After "Pigs in Heaven," even some Kingsolver fans were wearying of
her Southwest settings. This book gives them a whole new world, the
Belgian Congo in transition.
`84, Charing Cross Road' by Helene Hanff
Not a provocative story line for discussion -- it's the
correspondence between a New Yorker and a British bookseller--but
groups love the book-world setting. One even fashioned a road trip to
New York to visit the author's haunts.
`Beloved' by Toni Morrison
Beloved by readers, but dense language can be a turnoff. A
Pennsylvania group planned to see the movie, but got to the theater
and opted for "Practical Magic" instead.
`Ladder of Years' by Anne Tyler
A
fed-up wife goes out for a walk -- in her bathing suit -- and
doesn't come home. Fertile ground for wives of all stripes.
`In the Lake of the Woods' by Tim O'Brien
The big question -- did the politician kill his wife? -- can prompt
hours of wrangling.

Brazilian Troubles Rattle the Markets But Coffee and Sugar Finish High

Brazil's devaluation of its currency sent commodity markets on a wild ride, as traders scrambled to determine
whether another global financial crisis was imminent.
By the end of yesterday, traders appeared to shrug off their initial anxiety about Brazil. Indeed, some
commodity prices rose in the afternoon.
Prices for some raw materials with direct connections to Brazil, largely agricultural and tropical commodities,
were the most prominent examples of the seesaw phenomenon. Coffee futures fell by more than four cents in
morning trading on the New York Board of Trade's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, only to roar back later
to end the day higher. Sugar's movement was much the same.
Other commodities less directly related to Brazil reflected the uncertainty surrounding the effects of a change
in the nation's currency. Precious metals, continuing their plunge that began Tuesday, slipped again. Copper,
seen by many analysts as the most economically sensitive commodity, also fell in morning trading, but
recovered to settle just a bit lower than Tuesday's level.
"The general weakness in industrial markets is due to concerns over the global economy," said David
Rinehimer, director of futures research at Salomon Smith Barney. "Brazil has renewed the focus on the
vulnerability of the world economy and financial markets."
The major impact, of course, was on markets where Brazilian producers play a big role. March coffee at the
CSCE, after falling as low as $1.13 a pound, recovered on a positive report from influential market forecaster
Leon Yallouz to settle at $1.203 a pound, 3.15 cents higher than Tuesday's close. March sugar, which also
slipped on morning fears about Brazil, ended the day at 8.7 cents a pound, up 0.03 cent.
Traders' initial worries were that a cheaper real meant more Brazilian exports were likely to flood world
markets as the country sought foreign currency. Brazil is the world's largest producer of coffee and was
expected to export record amounts even before the devaluation.
But Mr. Yallouz's report put Brazil's coffee crop at between 23.7 million and 25.9 million 60-kilogram
bags-below earlier estimates-fueling the coffee market's strong finish. Traders said prices already had begun
to inch higher before the report emerged around midday.
William Darby, president and chief executive of Darby Trading Consultants, said the coffee market would
have recovered even without the report. "As far as I'm concerned, the devaluation was well anticipated," he
said. "Many markets overreacted from the get-go this early morning. Most professionals looked at the sharp
decline this morning as a good pricing opportunity."
James Steel, a commodity analyst at Refco in New York, also noted that gold failed to rally on the financial
uncertainty generated by Brazil's news. "There was no safe-haven buying anywhere," he said. "Gold is
definitely less of a financial tool for hedging against financial turmoil."

Gold Futures Fall as Dollar Gains Against Yen

Gold Futures Fall as Dollar Gains Against Yen

NEW YORK -- Gold futures came under steady selling pressure on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange as the dollar rose against the yen after Bank of Japan intervention.
Despite gold's modest rise Monday when the dollar fell to a 28-month low against the yen, it reacted strongly
yesterday to the dollar's rebound. Because gold is priced in dollars, dollar strength translates to higher prices
for consumers using other currencies.
The February Comex contract fell $4.30 to $289.30 a troy ounce.
"If you take away the buying power of the yen and the euro, all of a sudden everybody wants to walk through
the same door at the same time," said George Gero, senior vice president of investments at Prudential
Securities in New York.
But whether gold has returned to last year's inverse relationship with the dollar is yet to be seen. "It looks that
way today, but this is just one day," Mr. Gero said. "The jury's still out."
The dollar-yen ratio wasn't the only bearish factor in yesterday's gold sell-off, said Tony Caen, a senior
bullion dealer at Credit Lyonnais Rouse in New York.
Mr. Caen noted technical weakness -- what traders identify as key levels on price charts -- came when the
February Comex contract failed to close above $294 an ounce yesterday. He also said a report released
yesterday by an industry research group painted a bleak picture for gold in 1999.
Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. said gold prices are likely to be constrained by a buildup of inventories,
further sales from central bank coffers, and high mine production encouraged by currency depreciation in
gold-producing countries.
In other commodity markets yesterday:
SOYBEANS: Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade posted their weakest settlement since early October,
depressed by bearish government crop reports. The January contract dropped 7.25 cents to $5.3500 a
bushel. The USDA said U.S. soybean production in the 1998/99 crop year ending Sept. 1 would reach a
record 2.76 billion bushels and raised its estimates for South American soybean production. "The bottom line
is, we have more of everything," said John Zanutto, vice president with Merrill Lynch on the CBOT floor.
CRUDE OIL: Futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the market retreated from recent gains
and anticipated an inventory report due after the close of trading. The February contract fell 55 cents to
$12.89 a barrel. Analysts said they expect data from the American Petroleum Institute to show a rise from the
318.5 million barrels recorded in the week ended Jan. 1.

WILMINGTON, Del. -- Around 1800, a recent French immigrant went on a hunting trip hereabouts. Shocked
by the poor quality of American gunpowder, he resolved to go into business. The young man, trained as a
chemist, floated $36,000 in stock in America and in France, and set up a stone saltpeter mill in 1802 on a
swatch of farmland on the humid banks of the Brandywine River. Eight years later, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont
de Nemours was operating America's largest black-powder plant.
Ever since, there has scarcely been a trend in American business not affected by DuPont Co., believed to be
the nation's oldest big company. From its start selling gunpowder to the likes of Thomas Jefferson, DuPont
would become a giant of U.S. industry. Its explosives would supply firepower for five wars; they would open
gold mines, clear the way for transcontinental rails and blast a route for the Panama Canal.
As engineering feats of the 19th century gave way to molecular triumphs of the 20th, DuPont would rearrange
nature's palette to revolutionize daily life. The miracle of nylon emerged from DuPont's kitchen, like some
concoction from H.G. Wells; so did moisture-proof cellophane, Corian countertops and the chemical whitener
for Oreos' creamy center.
More broadly, DuPont's epic history is the story in miniature of the modern corporation. In March, when it next
pays a dividend, it will be for the 377th consecutive quarter. Along the way, it would evolve from a small
family business to a public company run by professional managers. It would expand from a single product to
hundreds, from local markets to the world.
Its ethos would change, too; once a paternalistic giant driven by the need for stability, DuPont would be
forced to adapt to a competitive world where profit was the overarching concern. Depressions would drive it
to the brink; politicians would try to break it up.
But like a synthetic creation from its lab, DuPont continually adjusted. It invented products and usurped them;
it expanded and shrank; it diversified and "focused"; it improved civilization and was a handmaiden to war. It
was a hot stock, a cold stock. After two centuries, 15% of its shares are, still, owned by descendants of the
first du Pont; three descendants sit on its board.
Like many business start-ups, however, the company barely survived its early years. Several times, the mill
blew up, with tragic loss of life. Each time, Mr. du Pont dug in his heels, held off his creditors and rebuilt. By
1827, he employed a then-remarkable 140 workers. Employee safety, a constant worry, fostered a
paternalistic spirit.
But Mr. du Pont was beset by money problems and sporadic complaints from distant stockholders -- it seems
they never change -- and succumbed to melancholia. After he died in 1834, the company was rechartered as
a partnership. The French and other original stockholders were bought out, the last in 1837, leaving the
founder's three sons and four daughters as sole owners.
DuPont weathered the depression of the 1840s, and greatly expanded capacity for the Civil War. Delaware
was boiling with secessionists, but Gen. Henry du Pont -- the second son of E.I. -- was vehemently
pro-Union, and cut off Southern customers even before the war began.
The general, a dashing horseman who rode about in a shiny stovepipe hat, dominated DuPont until the next
century -- an astonishing 97 years (with only slight interruption) of father-and-son rule. This rich genealogy
nurtured a long-term perspective at a time when American industry was highly dynamic and few businesses
outlived their founders.
DuPont thrived as America entered the machine age. Capitalizing on a new powerful explosive -- dynamite --
the company prepared the way for roads, tunnels, even the New York City subway. But, like other industrial
titans, DuPont was bedeviled by competition. Short of words but never of action, Gen. du Pont persuaded

rivals to form a Gunpowder Trade Association -- later known as the Powder Trust -- which brazenly fixed
prices and divided sales by region.
The general's death in 1899 left DuPont stricken. Tradition had become a vise; the company didn't even have
a telephone. More seriously, financial pressures had driven DuPont close to insolvency. Its aging stewards
put the company up for auction, but three young cousins -- great-grandsons of the founder -- made a
desperate bid to keep it in the family. The business was sold for $12 million. Pierre S. du Pont confessed at
the time, "We have not the slightest idea what we are buying."
Pierre had been a physically weak child, raised on the family estate, a manorial village that blended family
and company property. But having lost his father to a plant explosion, he grew up self-reliant, if rather
taciturn.
Though only 32, he quickly bought DuPont's main competitor -- in keeping with America's fin de siecle craze
for monopolization. More important, Pierre, a chemist, sensed the huge potential in a new explosive known as
smokeless powder, based on nitrocellulose. Cellulose, in other forms, could be coaxed into ready-to-wear
fibers and an array of amazingly malleable yet durable materials -- plastics.
Anticipating an era of scientific progress, DuPont in 1903 established the Experimental Station for research in
Wilmington. DuPont further expanded with a series of acquisitions in synthetic fibers and fabrics, heavy
chemicals, pigments, paints and dyes. Meanwhile, Pierre tended to organizational shortcomings. Within a
decade, management grew to 1,000; the staff, which a few years back had fit in four spare rooms, now lorded
over Wilmington from the stately DuPont Building.
This sudden scale required the forming of "departments" -- unknown to the small firms of the 19th century.
Also, DuPont broke new ground by establishing bonuses, pensions and a primitive stock-option plan.
Pierre consolidated his position at the top by fending off a suit from a resentful cousin who had tried to oust
him. But a second challenge -- from government trustbusters -- was more serious. In 1912, DuPont was
forced to part with a big piece of its explosives business. As luck would have it, though, DuPont got to keep
its entire military line -- right before the outbreak of World War I.
As chief supplier to the Allies, DuPont shipped an astonishing 1.5 billion pounds of explosives. By the war
years, there was an active market for DuPont shares, and the stock soared to $775 from $182. In an odd
way, the war forced Pierre to complete the diversification out of explosives -- or else the new factories built to
accommodate war needs would eventually be relegated to scrap.
The company soon invested in General Motors Corp., buying 27% of the troubled auto maker. In 1919, Pierre
gave the DuPont presidency to his brother Irenee, freeing Pierre to become GM's president and oversee a
rescue. But DuPont had troubles, too. In 1921, when the wartime boom gave way to recession, the brothers
(Pierre had continued as chairman) decided that DuPont's organizational form -- in which one department
handled purchasing for every product, another handled sales, and so on -- no longer made sense.
They hit on a radical solution: to reorganize DuPont along product lines. Now, one manager would be
responsible for everything to do with paints, another with plastics, and so on. As a byproduct, DuPont
liberated executives from static careers. Now, those with promise would be deliberately tested in many
divisions. The multidivisional format would soon become standard in the U.S.
Once again, DuPont's timing was superb; it answered the country's lust for consumer goods with an
avalanche of peacetime products. Its quick-drying finishes vastly shortened production time for autos; its
rayon and artificial leather sparked a revolution in apparels; its synthetic fluids created a boom in dry
cleaning. DuPont popularized Freon coolant, and solved the mystery of synthesizing rubber.
Lammot du Pont, brother of Pierre and Irenee and chief executive from 1926 to 1940, was an architect of this
renaissance, declaring (during the Great Depression, no less), "It is more important to carry out research than
to pay dividends," though dividends did indeed continue. In 1928, DuPont enlisted a team of scientists to
conduct "pure" research. The head of this effort, Wallace Carothers, a brilliant but moody Harvard chemist,
began to synthesize polymers -- the giant, interlocked chains of molecules found in nature. Mr. Carothers
invented nylon. Polymerization would lead to a new world of synthetics, including fabrics such as Orlon,
Dacron, bullet-resistant Kevlar and Lycra (Spandex).
DuPont executives blended a modern managerial spirit with intense family loyalties. As barons of a huge
empire, long after the age of robber barons, they led a surreal life, sheltered in some 24 lavish estates,
owners of a bank and of both Wilmington newspapers. Though anti-union, they indulged their workers,
offering pensions, rental housing, and modest death and disability support. In the Depression, they trimmed
the workweek to save jobs.

World War II brought a host of government contracts -- including one to make plutonium for the Manhattan
Project. But DuPont's relationship with Washington was troubled, and executives railed against intervention
even as they fed at the federal trough. Trustbusters repeatedly targeted DuPont, which was hit by 10 antitrust
suits in the 1940s and 1950s. Notably, the Truman administration sued to force DuPont to divest its holding in
GM, the source of 25% or so of DuPont's profits.
Pierre du Pont was greatly offended. According to Irving Shapiro, then a DuPont lawyer, Pierre failed to
realize that, politically, GM was too big for the government to allow such an alliance. As du Pont family
shareholders were personally named in the suit, DuPont supplied a picture of the youngest "conspirator" -- a
baby in a crib -- to newspapers, embarrassing the government, Mr. Shapiro recalls. But after a long battle,
DuPont had to divest. For a company that thrived on long-lived habits and cozy ties, the case was a first step
into a colder world in which markets mattered more than relationships.
Business boomed in the postwar years. DuPont developed plastic resins, polyester motion-picture film,
Teflon, Lucite and Tyvek (that almost tear-proof material in express-mail envelopes); it diversified into X-rays
and electronics. With Europe in tatters, DuPont made a major expansion overseas. "The cash flow was
enormous," Mr. Shapiro says. "We regarded ourselves as superior."
But by the 1960s, Europe and Japan were back on their feet. Competition intensified. Moreover, DuPont hit
fewer home runs in research. As patents expired and new ventures fell behind schedule, earnings growth
tailed off. DuPont was too inbred to see it coming -- not until 1967 did the last family CEO retire, and not until
the early '70s did the company accede to an outsider on its board. By then, chemicals were a maturing
business. When the price of oil skyrocketed, DuPont faced a crisis.
As it slogged through the '70s, DuPont had to face new, unfamiliar issues, such as the environment. Greens
said it was destroying the ozone layer with Freon (which DuPont long denied, though it finally dropped the
chemical in 1994). In 1974, the elevation to chief executive officer of Mr. Shapiro -- a former government
lawyer and a Jew -- signaled that the old, insulated DuPont was a thing of the past.
But momentum was hard to recapture. With inflation driving up costs, DuPont cut back on research, divested
old lines (including gunpowder) and diversified into new ones. In 1981, at the height of hysteria over oil
prices, DuPont spent $7 billion to buy Conoco -- then history's largest takeover.
But with so many new frontiers -- medical instruments, printing and publishing, electronic imaging -- DuPont
was becoming amorphous. Layers of management multiplied, as did bureaucratic fiefdoms.
"When growth slowed, the focus was to add other product areas," says Avi Nash, an analyst with Goldman,
Sachs & Co. in New York. "They became unwieldy." By 1986, the stock had fallen back to its level of 18 years
before.
In the late '80s, Unify Corp., a major customer, told Edgar Woolard, DuPont's CEO, that its polyester was no
longer competitive. That was the Rubicon. Setting a trend again, DuPont began a painful downsizing. Mr.
Woolard laid off 37,000 workers -- a quarter of the total. Most had assumed they had a job for life. "The
company thought it had several constituencies, like the Japanese did, and shareholders were way down the
list," says Harvard University's Alfred D. Chandler Jr., a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and distant du Pont
relative. But from then on, shareholders would be the only constituency.
In the '90s, its stock and profits hit new highs. DuPont divested inferior businesses and sold part of Conoco.
Fibers, pigments, polymers and chemicals are still core products. But the new chairman, 50-year-old Charles
O. Holliday Jr., has in mind a reinvention of the company to rival Pierre du Pont's. Mr. Holliday is focusing on
pharmaceuticals and bioengineering -- maybe corn that cuts the fat in pork, or bread that wards off cancer.
His dream is that life sciences will fuse with DuPont's materials business; perhaps the nylons of the future will
be synthesized from microbes rather than chemicals.
Just as notably, he is quickening DuPont's tempo. A company once driven by science now is driven by
marketing. Facilities have been moved closer to customers; automotive products are in Michigan; Dacron is in
North Carolina. Mr. Holliday, who spent seven years in Tokyo (the first CEO to work overseas), wants to
soften the lines between jobs, so that workers will think more flexibly. Discover what customers want, then
design it, could be his motto. "I want to solve problems -- not just make products," he says.
The Experimental Station is still here, its white-smocked scientists bent over test tubes and vats. But it is
unlikely to produce another Carothers. Research is oriented to processes, not to inventing bold new products.
In a sense, Mr. Holliday has little choice. With the family's ownership reduced, DuPont is in the hands of
impatient public owners. So long a trendsetter, DuPont has become a creature of the stock market, beholden
like others to its Wall Street masters. "They want consistent earnings -- I want the same thing," Mr. Holliday
says humbly.

Whether this can be meshed with the long-term thinking and ingenuity that once characterized DuPont, Mr.
Holliday and the world will have to see.

Since just after Christmas, the silver market has been visited by the ghost of rallies past.
Since falling below $4.70 an ounce on Dec. 2, its second trip to that low level since prices spiked in February
on news of Warren Buffett's interest in the market, silver has climbed fairly steadily. Last week it booked
increases every day but Monday, with the largest a 12.3-cent jump on Wednesday at the New York
Mercantile Exchange's Comex division. On Friday, the March contract rose 4.8 cents to settle at $5.288 an
ounce, the nearest-month's highest close since Oct. 1.
While that's still nowhere near last year's high of $7.28 an ounce, hit at the height of the buying frenzy
spawned by the Omaha investor's purchases, the current increase's timing echoes the price's move ahead of
Mr. Buffett's announcement last year. It's also well above the lows below $4 an ounce that the front-month
futures contract saw in the early 1990s. Silver, unlike gold, base metals and other commodities, hasn't been
anywhere near its historic lows recently.
That's not to say 1998 wasn't a rough year for the white metal. After the peak early in the year, silver prices
slipped steeply, traded in a range, then slipped again. And it isn't certain the rally will continue. Rumors about
Mr. Buffett shedding or adding to his large silver position constantly circulate on trading desks in New York
and London. A spokeswoman for Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett's firm, referred inquiries about the position
to the firm's written policy against discussing its investments.
Still, regardless of whether Mr. Buffett has bought more or sold, silver has held up well compared with gold's
long slide and the disastrous performance of its base-metal cousins.
One of the reasons for the silver price's relative hardiness is its hybrid status as both a base and precious
metal. That can be a double-edged sword: Neither group has been a bullish influence this year, with poor
Asian demand pressuring down basemetals prices and the weight of centralbank sales and waning investor
interest slicing into gold.
But because the prices for the two kinds of metals don't move up and down together, silver traders have two
sets of factors to look at when deciding whether to make a bullish or bearish bet. "It's predominantly an
industrial metal," says Jim Vail, who manages the Lexington Strategic Silver Fund, the only silver-stocks
mutual fund in the U.S. David Rinehimer, director of futures research at Salomon Smith Barney, added
Friday, "It's trading off its commodity fundamentals. The stock market is high and we've had good economic
numbers today. I don't think that's a negative background for silver."
However, silver also acts like a precious metal sometimes, which brings in the added factor of investment
demand. Traders and analysts note that one positive influence on silver prices recently arose from the
precious metals trade in India, a key demand center for both gold and silver.
The Indian government, citing gold's not-always-salutary influence on the country's foreign-exchange
balance, early last week said it raised the customs duty on imports of the yellow metal to 400 rupees, or
about $9.33, per 10 grams from 250 rupees, or $5.87. To the cost-conscious Indian investor interested in
precious metals, the duty on gold makes silver look like a better value. That gives a boost to demand.
Another, more straightforward factor buoying silver is the level of Comex stockpiles of the metal, Mr.
Rinehimer said. They now stand at about 76.9 million ounces, well below the year high of above 110 million
ounces. And technical traders, who buy and sell commodities based on price trends rather than
supply/demand factors, say historical charts have been working in silver's favor, helping propel the market
higher as key price levels were breached.

--- Page 35 ---

Some of the same traders caution that silver's rally may not last, particularly if the bullish technical signals
turn bearish and send the price back below $5.15 an ounce.
Meanwhile, gold, still trading in the doldrums between $285 and $300 an ounce, is scrambling to find some
news to follow and doesn't look likely to benefit from a continued rally in silver. "There's a lot of noise in the
market at the moment and we're trying to get beyond that to see what is really happening," says Kevin Crisp,
vice president at J.P. Morgan in London.
The gold market got some relatively positive news Thursday. European Central Bank officials said the
institution, which has surpassed the U.S. Federal Reserve as the world's largest holder of gold, doesn't plan
any sales of the metal "for the moment and for the foreseeable future." Central banks sales have exerted a
persistent downward pressure on gold prices in the last two years, and the ECB, a new player, has been a
wild card.
Mr. Crisp says the increase in recycled supplies due to such sales and bank leasing, coupled with the
increased subjection of gold to market forces, has changed the texture of the gold market. "Really, gold is
not a scarce commodity any longer," he says. "It lost a lot of its mystique as the market liberalized."
In other commodity markets Friday:
NICKEL: Futures jumped 13% on the London Metal Exchange after two producers announced cutbacks in
refined production totaling 26,000 metric tons as a result of a fall in prices. An overhang of excess supplies
totaling about 19,000 tons in 1998 caused nickel prices to plunge to an 11-year low of $3,772.50 a ton in
December. Nickel is used mostly for stainless steel, demand for which has shrunk because of economic
troubles in Asia and Russia.
The downtrend was at least temporarily reversed when Australia's WMC Ltd. shut its Kalgoorlie smelter for 70
days, reducing the smelter's annual output by 20,000 tons, and Greece's ferronickel producer Larco
announced that it will reduce output by 6,000 metric tons per year.
In an addition to the producers' news, traders said speculative investment funds began purchasing futures
contracts on the expectation that prices will move higher. As a result the price on the LME's benchmark
three-month contract jumped to $4,460 a ton from $3,947.50 a ton Thursday.
Robin Bhar, head of research at Brandeis (Brokers) Ltd., said the cutbacks announced within the first week of
1999 aren't far behind the 30,000 tons in cuts that were seen during all of 1998. But he added that more cuts
will be needed before the market moves back into balance. "We're not going to get a sustained recovery in
prices without future production cuts. These two cuts will erode the surplus, but we need another 10,000 to
15,000 tons to get the market back in balance," he said.
ORANGE JUICE: Futures rallied on the New York Cotton Exchange as funds bought futures to cover short
positions ahead of Monday's Agriculture Department report on the orange crop, and on talk that frost could hit
Florida Monday, traders said. The March contract rose 3.85 cents to $1.0375 a pound.

o, you think Bill Gates is rich? That he's building a palatial home? That he wields great power, and generates
adulation as well as fear?
Then you ought to meet Machmud of Ghazni. The ruler of a kingdom in central Asia at the beginning of the
millennium, Machmud resided in an opulent palace with legions of retainers, including 400 poets to entertain
him. He maintained a vast library of erotic manuscripts. His court offered so many temptations that renowned
mathematicians and scholars of the day declined invitations to live there -- worrying that they'd never again
accomplish anything of consequence.
The source of Machmud's riches? Plunder, mostly. He invaded India annually for 25 years, looting temples for
gold and jewels. In 1019, it is recorded, he took so many captives that prices of slaves plummeted for several
years.
The world has always been populated by the fabulously rich: from Machmud to the Medicis, from Rhodes to
Rockefeller, from Kublai Khan to Carnegie, from Arkwright to Astor, from Henry VIII to Philip II. They amassed
their fortunes in different centuries, in all regions of the world and from an astonishing array of goods and
services: gold and silver, of course, but also kingfisher feathers, silk, spices, embezzlement, taxation, slave
trading, money lending, cotton spinning, furs, timber, diamonds, railroads, steel, oil, shipping and computer
software.
It's also remarkable, with the perspective of 1,000 years, how fleeting wealth can be. The rich don't always
get richer. Some get a lot poorer, while some of the poor get a lot richer.
Moreover, it's clear that the effect of wealth has changed. Throughout the ages, the incredibly affluent have
been both envied and reviled, on occasion with good reason because their riches were built with devastating
effects on the poor. But while the wealthy sometimes still take advantage of the weak, the benefits of wealth
in recent centuries increasingly have spread beyond the wealthy.
"In certain senses, fabulously rich people are good for society," says Martha Howell, a professor of
socioeconomic history at Columbia University. "Some people imagine an ideal society is one in which there is
no hierarchy of wealth. But a very good argument can be made that hierarchies of wealth are not in
themselves bad. The question is, how much mobility is there in society, and how is wealth used?"
Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, a historian and author of the book "Millennium," agrees: "You can't achieve a
distribution of wealth unless you have wealth in the first place, which means that some people have to
accumulate it."
If the rich have always been with us, the fundamental nature of wealth accumulation, and wealth distribution,
has changed over the centuries, helping to transform the world economically. At the start of the millennium,
the problem -- at least for the rest of civilization -- was that the truly wealthy rarely created large amounts of
new wealth, except for themselves. The richest people were rulers who either controlled and exploited natural
resources on their own soil or conquered their neighbors to get what they wanted.
The richest man in Moorish Spain, one of the world's richest countries in the year 1000, took the name
Al-Mansur (Arabic for "the Conqueror") as a proud nom de guerre for the successful raids he led frequently
against Christian Spain -- sacking Barcelona, for example. Largely with the booty he took, Al-Mansur
amassed more than six million pieces of gold and built a fabulous palace called Madinat al-Zahira, "the
Shining City."
Many of the powerful found ransom was especially lucrative. When France's King Louis IX was captured in
Egypt in 1250 during the Crusades, the Mamluk dynasty enriched itself by exacting 240 tons of silver for his
release.

But pillage and ransom amount to a zero-sum game. "The basic assets of the world were static," says Ms.
Howell. "Wealth was accumulated largely by taking wealth from other cultures."
As the millennium progressed, economies increasingly were driven by a growing international commerce in
natural resources and rare goods, multiplying wealth in ways that would reverberate through society. Trade
was hardly a new way to make money; Phoenicians had plied the Mediterranean 1,500 years before the start
of the first millennium. But in the past millennium, traders began traveling greater distances from home,
beckoned by the opportunity to earn greater riches the farther they ventured. So, even as 11th-century
Byzantine Emperor Basil II became known as "Slayer of Bulgars" for his ruthless conquest of that nation, he
also reaped huge profits producing and trading silk.
It was a global trend. In 12th-century Cambodia, for instance, Suryavarman II found that there was big money
to be made exporting luxury items such as kingfisher feathers and elephant tusks to China. Much of what he
made, he spent -- lavishly. The monarch constructed Angkor Wat, perhaps the world's largest religious
monument. He rode in a gold carriage atop an elephant with tusks sheathed in gold, and his palace boasted
two towers of gold and one of copper, while a bridge of gold surrounded by golden lions marked its entrance.
In Africa, Mansa Musa I grew wealthy in the early 14th century from Mali's thriving gold trade. On a
pilgrimage to Mecca, his caravan carried gold worth about $115 million at today's prices.
Though rulers and governments exerted control over trade, commerce also created vast amounts of private
wealth for the first time among the merchants who had business savvy and an ability to find new markets.
Moreover, burgeoning international commerce also created an extensive need for credit; rather than
operating simply on a cash basis, merchants realized they could trade more goods -- and thus reap higher
profits -- if they could borrow money to finance their expeditions. Thus began an era of nouveau riche
financiers, who enriched not only themselves but others.
"There were many more opportunities open to many more people," says Jonathan Williams, author of
"Money: A History" and a curator at the British Museum. "In the ancient world, there was an oligarchical elite
ruling over the peasantry, and there was no access to capital for someone who had a good idea if he didn't
already have everything going for him."
Many powerful money men, like Filippo di Amedeo de Peruzzi of Florence, themselves started as merchants,
and got into finance as a lucrative sideline. In the late 13th century, the Peruzzi family traded spices, wool
and other precious goods, then used some of their earnings to finance other merchants. In addition, they lent
huge sums to monarchs such as Edward III of England, who needed the money to help pay bills during the
Hundred Years' War against France. (Alas, when England defaulted on its debts, the Peruzzis went broke.)
Jakob Fugger II of Germany, a financier who lived from 1459 to 1525, exceeded the Peruzzis in wealth and
influence. "The king reigns, but the bank rules!" proclaimed Fugger, who maintained banks in major European
cities. Fugger and his family also operated silver, gold and copper mines, and traded spices and wool.
Not all riches were accumulated from productive commerce, of course. Fugger benefited handsomely from a
contract for handling the Roman Catholic Church's income from the sale of indulgences (payments made by
the faithful for the remission of sins). Pope Alexander VI, who became a cardinal in 1456 and pope in 1493,
lived in luxury by siphoning off untold riches from church funds. Liu Jin, a eunuch during China's Ming
dynasty, also reputedly grew wealthy from graft before being executed in 1510 for abusing his authority.
If trade and finance -- and, occasionally, corruption -- helped create most great fortunes in the middle of the
millennium, industry would line the pockets of the rich in the centuries that followed. The fabled figures of the
industrial age set in motion a tectonic economic shift that changed not only how wealth was made, but also
how most people lived and worked. Industrialists transformed economies that had been largely agrarian into
an urban, mass-production world.
Perhaps most important, for the first time economic mobility became possible on a grand scale. Talk about a
millionaire next door: An early industrialist was an unlikely entrepreneur named Richard Arkwright, who was
born in 1732 into a poor family in Preston, England. Yet, at his death 60 years later, he was among the
wealthiest men in Europe. His tale shows how someone who wasn't born to money could go from rags to
riches with a good idea.
Arkwright, who trained to be a barber and wig maker, was inspired by a sailor he overheard discussing a
Chinese device that used water power. He invented a huge cotton-spinning machine, the water frame, that
used hydro power, allowing faster and larger-scale textile manufacturing than ever before. The equipment,
which not only reduced costs but also produced higher-quality cotton yarn, made Arkwright a rich man in just
a few years.
As wealthy as Arkwright was, he could hardly have imagined the unfathomable fortunes that would be made
by those who would follow him. Several American entrepreneurs -- such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford

and John D. Rockefeller, none to the manor born -- took industrial production to a new, higher level and
became as rich as kings in the process.
Carnegie, who was born in 1835 in Scotland to a poor weaver, revolutionized the steel industry with
more-efficient production methods. He made a fortune, but by the time he died in 1919, he had given an
estimated $350 million -- roughly $7 billion in today's dollars -- to various charities, declaring, "The man who
dies rich. . . dies disgraced."
A few people, of course, still get their wealth the old-fashioned way: rather than earning it, they inherit it or
they lord over a country blessed with natural resources -- or both, like the Sultan of Brunei, whose tiny Asian
nation has vast reserves of oil. Even at the currently depressed price of oil, the sultan is a billionaire many
times over.
Still, wealth has become even more democratized in latter part of the 20th century, as fortunes are made with
breathtaking speed in knowledge and service industries that don't need large capital investments. Bill Gates,
a virtually unknown college dropout just two decades ago, is now worth at least $75 billion, thanks to the
success of Microsoft Corp., the company he co-founded. But he's only one of a growing legion of
techno-parvenus -- such as Michael Dell of Dell Computer, Ted Waitt of Gateway Computer, Jeff Bezos of
Amazon.com -- billionaires all, and all still in their 30s.
Indeed, with more than 3.5 million millionaires in the U.S. alone, according to the government, being a mere
millionaire has little status today. Even being a $100 million-plus millionaire won't rank someone very high on
a "richest" list anymore; the number of billionaires world-wide is estimated to have swelled to several
thousand.
Mr. Gates, indisputably, is the richest of the bunch. But, is he the richest of the millennium?
Calculating and comparing wealth over a 1,000-year period poses problems -- starting with the fact that
estimates, at best, are just that, and at worst are wild speculation. It's easy enough to figure the value of Bill
Gates's Microsoft stock, but what about his other holdings that aren't publicly disclosed?
And the further back economic historians go, the harder it is to make anything more than a rough guess of an
individual's assets. Most references to imperial wealth in China early in the millennium are too vague for a
specific accounting. Inflation compounds the difficulty; it may be easy to translate the value of
early-20th-century riches into today's dollars, but it's a lot trickier translating 13th-century figures. Finally,
fortunes rise and fall during a lifetime; at what point should someone's wealth be determined?
Different techniques generate different rankings, as a Gates vs. Rockefeller face-off reveals. By one measure
-- inflation-adjusted net worth -- Mr. Gates is richer, with Rockefeller's $900 million of yesteryear the
equivalent of $15 billion in today's dollars, or just one-fifth of Mr. Gates's wealth. By another, Mr. Gates is a
pauper compared with Rockefeller. Mr. Gates's net worth equals 0.88% of America's current gross domestic
product of $8.5 trillion, well below Rockefeller's 2.5% of GDP in his lifetime. In today's economy, Rockefeller's
share of GDP would translate to $212.5 billion, or nearly triple Mr. Gates's wealth.
But if that's how the richest of the rich should be determined, what about monarchs of earlier centuries?
Those greedy enough could "own" their nation's entire wealth. Genghis Khan, the Mongol who conquered
much of Asia in the early 1200s, commanded unquestioned power and authority over both subjects and land
-- something that neither Mr. Gates nor Rockefeller can claim. Then there was Louis XIV, ruler of France from
1643 to 1715, who famously declared, "L'etat c'est moi" -- "I am the state."
Glyn Davies, author of "A History of Money" and retired professor of finance at the University of Wales, notes,
"In the sense that money is power, it's a relative thing. Wealthy people had tremendous power in medieval
times, even if in material terms they were less rich."
Then again, measured by worldly goods, even the wealthiest person of yesteryear couldn't buy at any price
many of the taken-for-granted luxuries that everyman enjoys today. "How do you compare the wealth of
Henry VIII of England with that of a Goldman Sachs partner today?" asks Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of
economics and international affairs at Princeton University. "What would Henry VIII have traded for
television?"

The Millennium---People:Rich & Richer---Fifty of the Wealthiest People of the Past 1,000 Years
The Millennium --- People: Rich & Richer --- Fifty of the Wealthiest People of the Past 1,000 Years

Corrections & Amplifications
CHINESE COMMUNISTS took control of mainland China in 1949; in an item on wealthy financier T.V. Soong
in the Millennium report published Monday, it was incorrectly stated that the Soviets captured China. In
addition, Chiang Kai-shek was Sun Yat-sen's successor, not his rival. (WSJ Jan. 14, 1999)
Throughout the millennium, and even before it, people have been fascinated by wealth and the wealthy --
who has how much, how they got it, how they spent it. And, of course, who has the most.
Who were the wealthiest people of the past 1,000 years? Potentates and popes, merchants and monarchs,
industrialists, inventors and investors. Some are famous to this day, others infamous in their day. Some lost
their fortunes after becoming wealthy; others gave their fortunes away. And there is only one woman on the
list, because for most of the millennium women were prevented from earning or inheriting large fortunes.
So here are 50 of the richest people of the millennium. These aren't necessarily the 50 richest; historians
have found that precisely measuring and comparing wealth over 10 centuries is a nearly impossible task. But
these 50, listed chronologically, were by any measure outrageously and unfathomably wealthy in their eras --
not only rich, but often powerful, and with lifestyles to match.
Al-Mansur (938-1002)
-- Occupation: Leader of Moors
-- Source of wealth: Sacking, plundering
-- Assets: Six million pieces of gold
-- Claim to fame: Named himself "the Conqueror"
The dashingly handsome Moorish leader, born Abu'Amir al-Ma'asiri, rose to power in 979 by wooing the
caliph's favorite concubine. That's also when he renamed himself Al-Mansur ("the Conqueror"). Every
summer, Al-Mansur raided Christian Spain and hauled his booty back to Cordoba, where he also collected
taxes from the prosperous citizens. He built a fabulous palace called Madinat al-Zahira -- the Shining City.
Sometime later, a witness to the sacking of the castle by mutineers said, "Devils play in what had once been
spaces full of luxury and melody. . . overspilling with jewels under vaults so splendid as to conjure heaven."
Basil II (958-1025)
-- Occupation: Byzantine Emperor
-- Source of wealth: Land confiscation, silk monopolies
-- Assets: 300,000 pounds of gold
-- Claim to fame: Nickname, "Slayer of Bulgars," was well-earned
Under Basil II, the Byzantine Empire became the most powerful kingdom in Europe. Basil annexed Bulgaria
by 1018, when he received the moniker "Slayer of Bulgars" and blinded thousands of Bulgarian prisoners. He
flourished by manufacturing and trading silk. During his reign, the Byzantine Empire held a monopoly on
royal-purple silk, a fabric prized by European monarchs. While his underground chambers held a vast store of
gold, Basil II lived simply, relative to other monarchs, always dressing in the same royal-purple silk cape and
purple boots.
Machmud of Ghazni (971-1030)

--- Page 40 ---
Page 40 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Occupation: Ruler of Afghanistan
-- Source of wealth: Plundering, slave trading
-- Assets: Gold, jewels, erotic manuscripts
-- Claim to fame: Filled poet's mouth with pearls
For 25 years, Machmud made annual invasions of northern India, pillaging temples, capturing slaves and
transporting his spoils home on elephants. One year, he returned with so many captives that prices in the
Afghan slave market plummeted. His court, the center of Persian/Islamic civilization, was decorated from floor
to ceiling with tapestries of hunts and banquets; his library held a large collection of erotic manuscripts. He
shared his palace with 400 poets, and he knew how to show his appreciation for the arts: He once filled a
bard's mouth with pearls three times to acknowledge a moving eulogy.
Tenkaminen (11th century)
-- Occupation: Caliph of Ghana
-- Source of wealth: Import-export
-- Assets: Gold
-- Claim to fame: Always grabbed the biggest hunks for himself
Tenkaminen exported gold, ivory and salt and then used his wealth to put glass windows in his palace in
Kumbi, where he also kept a menagerie of elephants and giraffes. He would wear only silk, and his horses
were tethered with gold rings. According to an Islamic traveler, "If gold nuggets are discovered in the
country's mines, [Tenkaminen] reserves them for himself and leaves the gold dust for his subjects. . . . The
king is said to possess a nugget as big as a large stone."
Al-Mustansir (1029-1094)
-- Occupation: Ruler of most of North Africa
-- Source of wealth: Trade
-- Assets: Gold, jewels
-- Claim to fame: Rode under a gold and bejeweled parasol
The wealthiest of the Fatimid caliphs, Al-Mustansir reportedly rode everywhere under a golden parasol
encrusted with jewels. Based in Cairo, he ruled most of North Africa and enriched his empire through
prosperous Red Sea trade routes. A Persian envoy of the late 1040s was dazzled by the wealth of Cairo
under Al-Mustansir's reign, writing, "I could see no limit to its wealth, and nowhere have I beheld such
prosperity as I saw there." However, Al-Mustansir's assets weren't safe from plague and famine; in 1070, the
caliph had to send the city's women to Baghdad to escape starvation.
Suryavarman II (died around 1150)
-- Occupation: Khmer ruler
-- Source of wealth: Import-export
-- Assets: Gold
-- Claim to fame: Commissioned Angkor Wat
Suryavarman is responsible for perhaps the largest religious monument in the world -- Angkor Wat, built with
stones weighing as much as 8,000 pounds each. When he traveled, the monarch rode in a lion-skin throne
atop an elephant with tusks sheathed in gold. Hundreds of young women flanked the carriage, bearing the
king's gold and silver plate, spears and shields. Suryavarman traded elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns and
kingfisher feathers for gold. The feathers, highly prized in China for bridal attire, may have been the empire's
chief source of income.
Enrico Dandolo (1107-1205)
-- Occupation: Ruler of Venice
-- Source of wealth: Trade, plundering

--- Page 41 ---
Page 41 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Assets: Opulent palazzo
-- Claim to fame: Financed the "rape of Constantinople"
Dandolo was elected doge of Venice in 1192 at the age of 85. At the time, Venice was the wealthiest city in
Europe because it controlled Mediterranean trade. Dandolo, who was blind, spearheaded the Fourth
Crusade, funding the army to capture Constantinople from the "infidels."
After the "rape of Constantinople," Dandolo pocketed some of the city's riches, shipping valuable marble to
his son for the construction of the Palazzo de Dandolo on the Grand Canal. He also stole four bronze horses
and placed them over the entry to the Cathedral of San Marco to remind Venetians of his power.
Innocent III (1160-1216)
-- Occupation: Pope
-- Source of wealth: Taxes
-- Assets: Cash
-- Claim to fame:
-- Oversaw the founding of monastic orders known for poverty
As leader of the Roman Catholic Church, Innocent controlled its coffers at the height of its power. The Church
squeezed taxes out of its subjects any way it could. And Innocent made himself solely responsible for
absolving most sins, charging an indulgence -- a fee in exchange for a pardon. Innocent III oversaw two
crusades, further fattening the Church's treasury. As revenue grew, he hired Italian merchant bankers to
manage the papal funds. Yet despite his staggering wealth and power, Innocent espoused frugality. One of
his enduring achievements was sanctioning the Franciscan and Dominican orders, both known for apostolic
poverty.
Genghis Khan (1162-1227)
-- Occupation: Conqueror
-- Source of wealth: Looting
-- Assets: Almost five million square miles of land
-- Claim to fame: Lived to humiliate his enemies
If wealth were measured by lands conquered, Genghis Khan would rank as one of the wealthiest people ever.
He began his career by uniting feuding Mongol tribes and then went on to seize almost five million square
miles covering what is now China, Iran, Iraq, Burma, Vietnam, and most of Korea and Russia. Genghis Khan,
whose name means "Universal Ruler," conquered as much for the sheer fun of it as for the spoils. He rode a
horse and slept in a tent. "The greatest joy," he proclaimed, "is to conquer one's enemies, to pursue them, to
seize their property, to see their families in tears, to ride their horses and to possess their daughters dand
wives."
Kublai Khan (1215-1294)
-- Occupation: Conqueror and heir
-- Source of wealth: Inheritance
-- Assets: Gold and jewels
-- Claim to fame: Inspired Xanadu
Kublai Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, failed in military campaigns against Japan, Southeast Asia and
Indonesia, but he established the Yuan dynasty in China and built a sumptuous court of gilded cane at Ta-tu
(now Beijing). Marco Polo marveled at the jeweled splendor of Kublai Khan's summer palace, Shang-tu -- the
inspiration for the "Xanadu" of English poet Coleridge's work. Polo was also amazed by the indulgent feasting
and hunting, and by Kublai
Khan's ships, which were large enough to carry 1,000 men and "made the passengers feel as if they were on
dry land."

Kublai Khan zealously promoted paper money, forcing its use under penalty of punishment and confiscating
everyone else's gold and silver.
Filippo di Amedeo de Peruzzi (died 1303)
-- Occupation: Banker
-- Source of wealth: Sales, money lending
-- Assets: Ships, hotels, chapel with Giotto frescoes
-- Claim to fame: Hitched wagon to wrong star
Leader of one of the first great Florentine banking families, de Peruzzi rose to prominence in 1275 and soon
had bank branches in Naples, Paris and London. The Peruzzi clan underwrote business ventures throughout
Europe; they also bought wool, spices, jewelry and silk wholesale, and owned ships and hotels from one end
of Europe to the other. At their palazzos, they welcomed many monarchs and popes of the time, who came to
borrow enormous sums of money.
But when Edward III of England defaulted on his debts after losing the Hundred Years' War,the Peruzzis went
bankrupt.
The victorious king of France exiled them from Florence and confiscated their goods for lending money to the
wrong side.
Mansa Musa I (ruled 1307-1337)
-- Occupation: Ruler of Mali
-- Source of wealth: Trading gold
-- Assets: Gold
-- Claim to fame: Executed people who sneezed in his presence
Although the Mansa claimed his gold grew from the ground like carrots, it most likely came from Africa's
Niger, Gambia and Senegal rivers. The Mansa loved to build, and he commissioned grand mosques, paying
his architects in gold dust. At his court, he was entertained by poets dressed in thrushes' feathers with
wooden heads and red beaks; he sentenced to death those who dressed in sandals or sneezed in his
presence. In 1325, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca with 60,000 porters; 80 camels carrying 300 pounds of
gold each; and 500 slaves clad in brocade and Persian silk and bearing golden staffs. According to an Arab
chronicler, "He appeared amidst his companions magnificently dressed and mounted, and surrounded by
more than 10,000 of his subjects."
Jacques Coeur (1395-1456)
-- Occupation: Financial adviser
-- Source of wealth: Wheeling-dealing
-- Assets: Gold
-- Claim to fame: Put too much faith in a valiant heart
Coeur, chief financial adviser to Charles VII of France, ran a variety of businesses -- selling luxury goods like
armor and spices, trading salt, and dealing in wheat and wool. Coeur bankrolled Charles's wars with the
British, lending him 200,000 ecus -- nearly a ton of gold -- in 1449. He built a Gothic mansion at Bourges with
his family motto etched in stone: "To valiant hearts nothing is impossible." But in 1451, rivals charged Coeur
with poisoning the king's mistress, Agnes Sorel. Although Sorel had actually died in childbirth, Charles
confiscated Coeur's properties and sent him to jail. Coeur escaped, fled to Rome and died several years later
fighting the Turks.
Cosimo de Medici (1389-1464)
Occupation: Merchant banker
Source of wealth: Catholic Church
Assets: Gold

--- Page 43 ---
Page 43 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Claim to fame: Head of Europe's richest, most powerful family
The Medici family traded wool, silk and other luxury items from Asia; monopolized the alum trade (a fixative
for dye); and lent money to popes, monarchs and merchants at hefty interest rates. Their most profitable
client was the Church, for which they served as world-wide tithe and tax collectors. But Cosimo de Medici's
power ruffled other Florentine families, and in 1431 he was arrested for "having sought to elevate himself
higher than others." Using well-placed bribery, de Medici reduced his sentence from execution to banishment.
When his absence led to a financial crisis in Florence, however, he was quickly invited back. After de Medici's
death, the family fortune was squandered by his son, Piero (1416-1469), nicknamed il Gottoso, or "the Gouty
One."
Nyatsimba, Mwene Matapa (late 15th century)
-- Occupation: Chief of Zimbabwe Empire
-- Source of wealth: Ravaging, plundering
-- Assets: Gold, porcelain
-- Claim to fame: Protected by women warriors
Nyatsimba conquered the middle Zambezi Valley, a land rich in gold, textiles, salt and elephants, and built
imposing stone citadels at Great Zimbabwe, the empire's capital. He became known as "Mwene Matapa" or
"Monomotapa" ("Lord of the Plundered People" or "Ravager of the Lands"), and true to his title, he plundered
(as well as legitimately traded) gold jewelry, jeweled ironwork, enormous copper ingots and even Chinese
porcelain brought across the Indian Ocean. The Monomotapa was known to have a corps of more than 100
female bodyguards.
Alexander VI (1431-1503)
Occupation: Pope
Source of wealth: Graft, embezzlement
Assets: Cash, jewels, tapestries
Claim to fame: Possibly history's most corrupt pope
Alexander VI was so profligate that his reign helped inspire the Protestant reformation. A member of the
prominent Borgia family of Spain, Alexander was appointed cardinal by his uncle, Pope Calixtus III, in 1456
and went on to amass a fabulous fortune by pocketing church funds. He lived the life of a Renaissance
prince, also serving as patron of the arts. After fathering many children, including the notorious Lucrezia
Borgia, he was elected pope in 1492. From the papal coffers, he took 100,000 ducats in cash (worth almost
800 pounds of gold) and 75,000 ducats' worth (nearly 600 pounds of gold) of jewels, plate, linen, clothing
and tapestries for his daughter's dowry. Alexander's tenure, filled with political and family intrigue, can only be
described as Machiavellian; in fact, Machiavelli wrote "The Prince" based on him.
Liu Jin (1452-1510)
-- Occupation: Court eunuch
-- Source of wealth: Graft
-- Assets: Gold and silver
-- Claim to fame: Inspired morality tales on the danger of greed
A fabulously wealthy court eunuch of China's Ming dynasty, Liu Jin abused his office to amass a great
fortune. When he was finally executed for treason, he was found to have 12 million ounces of gold and 259
million ounces of silver. By comparison, the treasury of the imperial palace had only 30 million to 70 million
ounces of silver when the dynasty fell. However, reports of Liu Jin's wealth might have been grossly
exaggerated, since chroniclers used his story to warn what can happen when an imperial eunuch annoys
enough people.
Montezuma II (1466-1520)
-- Occupation: Aztec emperor
-- Source of wealth: Taxation

--- Page 44 ---
Page 44 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Assets: Food, spices, ornaments
-- Claim to fame: Was served 300 different kinds of food every day
Montezuma II set up a tribute system in which he ordered his subjects (residents of most of Mexico and
Central America) to make annual payments of 140,000 bushels of maize, 105,000 bags of beans, 105,000
sacks of sage, 4,000 blocks of salt and 980 loads of cacao -- plus jade beads, feather war ornaments, exotic
bird skins, blocks of amber, jaguar pelts and victims for religious sacrifices. His slaves supposedly served him
300 daily dishes, including stewed turkey, pheasants, quail, wild and domestic duck, venison, fried songbirds
and pigeons. Montezuma used his wealth and labor force to build a capital at Tenochtitlan with palaces,
pyramids, plazas and a complex system of canals and bridges. Conquistador Castillio described a meeting
with the Aztec leader: "The Great Montezuma descended from his litter, and these other great Caciques
support him beneath a marvelously rich canopy of green feathers, decorated with gold work, silver, pearls. . . .
It was a marvelous site."
Jakob Fugger II (1459-1525)
-- Occupation: Banker
-- Source of wealth: Money management
-- Assets: Mines, silk factories
-- Claim to fame: Nicknamed "Fugger the Rich"
"The king reigns, but the bank rules!" declared Jakob Fugger II of Augsburg, Germany. He was known as
"Fugger the Rich," and minted his own money and maintained banks in every European capital. Fugger and
his family also owned silver, gold and copper mines, traded spices and wool, and operated silk factories in
Asia. Fugger held the contract for managing the pope's money and collecting cash for the remission of sins,
and he bankrolled Charles V's election as Holy Roman Emperor, which involved bribes of sums three times
the annual revenue of Florence. Fugger, like other powerful figures at the time, commissioned bronze "portrait
medals" of himself -- coins with his own picture on them -- and handed them out to his friends. Fugger was
said to have hired a personal fortuneteller to predict the outcomes of his business deals; he died leaving two
million guilders, or more than seven tons of gold.
Atahualpa (1502-1533)
-- Occupation: Emperor of the Incas
-- Source of wealth: Mining
-- Assets: Gold and silver
-- Claim to fame: Filled a room with gold but was decapitated anyway
Atahualpa's empire held a fabled supply of gold and silver, taken from the mines of the Andes. When he was
captured by the Spanish conquistador Pizarro, Atahualpa offered to cover the floor of the room in which they
were standing with gold, a chamber approximately 17 feet wide by 22 feet long. Receiving no answer, he
increased his offer, to fill the room with gold as high as his hands could reach. Pizarro's men drew a line
around the room at the height indicated by Atahualpa. They stripped the palace and temples of treasures,
household goods and arms, producing about 124 tons of gold and silver, when melted down to bullion and
ingots -- the richest ransom ever received. Despite their deal, Pizarro immediately re-arrested Atahualpa on
charges of treason to the Spanish crown and decapitated him.
Henry VIII (1491-1547)
-- Occupation: King of England
-- Source of wealth: Taxes
-- Assets: Gold, jewels, baubles
-- Claim to fame: Never did find the perfect wife
Henry VIII may have been the wealthiest monarch in British history. A 1547 inventory of Henry VIII's property
estimated that his jewels, tapestries and palaces were worth about GBP 300,000 and his military equipment
was valued at another GBP 300,000, which combined would be roughly the equivalent of $250 million today.
By comparison, the annual income of a duke, second in wealth to the king, was about GBP 6,000, or $2.5
million in today's dollars. Henry lived an opulent life, eating off gold plate and reading books with nice covers,

such as one described in the inventory as "a booke of golde garnyshed with rubies Emerades and
Dyamounts." His military collection included handguns, cannons, spears, javelins, cannonballs and arrows.
He owned a small gold object with a spatula on one end that is now housed in the Victoria and Albert
Museum. It's identified as a "whistell for the tete and eares" -- a combination tooth- and earpick.
Suleiman The Magnificent (1494-1566)
-- Occupation: Ruler of the Ottoman Empire
-- Source of wealth: Taxes
-- Assets: Gold, jeweled crowns
-- Claim to fame: His harem could accommodate 2,000 women
On Suleiman's mammoth estate were 10 mosques, 14 steam baths and two hospitals. The head cook, with
50 sous-chefs, 30 confectioners and 100 tasters, worked magic with dates, plums and prunes from Egypt,
and honey from Romania. One chronicler wrote of Suleiman's palace that "the walls shine and scintillate with
an abundance of gold and silver. . .and with precious stones and marble." At court ceremonies, the sultan sat
upon a spacious imperial stool and wore a spectacular gold helmet topped by a plume. His crown boasted
174 gems, including turquoise, rubies, diamonds, pearls and emeralds. Even the sultan's horses were richly
attired. As one French visitor marveled: "We did not see a single one of these horses (which numbered about
200) which did not have reins and stirrups of pure gold or silver."
Sir Thomas Gresham (1519-1579)
-- Occupation: Merchant prince
-- Source of wealth: Multiple businesses
-- Assets: Six estates, cash
-- Claim to fame: Inspired Gresham's law, an economic observation
Sir Thomas was a British banker, money-changer, textile trader, goldsmith and financial agent of Elizabeth I.
He stabilized the English currency and the national debt by advising the queen to re-coin the currency.
(Gresham's law, a concept he didn't originate, but employed well, observes that "bad money drives out good."
With coins of equal face value, but different metals, the cheaper metal will drive the better out of circulation
because people will hoard the precious metal.) He also ran a news service in the Netherlands to keep
informed of finance there and in 1658, at his own expense, built the Royal Exchange of London, modeled on
the Antwerp commodities exchange. When not trading, Sir Thomas relaxed at one of his six estates in the
British countryside. He died one of the richest men of his day, leaving his widow an annual income of almost
GBP 2,400, a remarkable sum for the 16th century, equivalent to almost $600,000 a year today.
Philip II (1527-1598)
-- Occupation: King of Spain
-- Source of wealth: Skimming
-- Assets: Cash
-- Claim to fame: His wealth sank with the Armada
Philip II collected one-fifth of all the revenue generated from the mines of the Americas and trade in the
Indies. (The rest went to merchants.) He plowed most of the money back into the dynasty. The royal treasury
generated about 10 million ducats -- equivalent to more than 34 tons of gold -- a year, but Philip's private
expenses measured only about 400,000 ducats -- or 1.4 tons of gold -- a year. Most of Philip's money was
invested in the military. After the Armada's disastrous defeat in 1588, Philip went into severe debt, owing
creditors more than 85 million ducats -- or almost 300 tons of gold -- at the time of his death.
Shah Abbas (1571-1629)
-- Occupation: King of the Safavid dynasty in Persia
-- Source of wealth: Monopoly on silk
-- Assets: Dazzling city
-- Claim to fame: His polo fields had marble goal posts

--- Page 46 ---
Page 46 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Shah Abbas developed the most splendid city of the age, Isfahan, with
a central plaza seven times the size of the Piazza di San Marco in
Venice; a breathtaking imperial mosque (constructed so that it could be
seen from all over the city) covered by enameled tiles and surrounded by
90-foot walls; 273 public baths; and polo fields with marble goal posts.
To finance this, the shah established a monopoly on the production and
sale of silk, a shrewd move since Persian silks, unparalleled in their
intricacy and colors, were prized by foreign merchants. Persian artistic
achievement in carpets, painting and architecture reached a high point
during Shah Abbas's reign. But by the end of his life he had grown so
fearful of assassination that he turned on his own family, executing one
son and blinding two more sons, his father and his brothers.
Albrecht Wenzel von Wallenstein (1583-1634)
-- Occupation: Soldier of fortune
-- Source of wealth: Profiteering
-- Assets: Gold, almost all of Bohemia
-- Claim to fame: Didn't get the severance package he had hoped for
Wallenstein prospered by providing armed regiments to Ferdinand, the Habsburg emperor, during the Thirty
Years' War. Born into a minor noble family in Bohemia, Wallenstein was 25 when he married an elderly
widow with huge estates in Moravia. Four years later, she died and left him a fortune. From 1618 to 1623,
Wallenstein's fellow noblemen tried to depose the emperor, but Wallenstein stayed loyal and was
well-compensated when Ferdinand prevailed. Appointed governor of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Wallenstein
manipulated the coinage and bought nearly 60 estates owned by defeated noblemen. A few years later,
realizing that his soldiers and the emperor were plotting against him, Wallenstein offered to resign in
exchange for a considerable severance package. Instead, the emperor ordered Wallenstein murdered in his
sleep.
Nicolas Fouquet (1615-1680)
-- Occupation: Louis XIV's treasurer
-- Source of wealth: Embezzlement
-- Assets: Fabulous chateau
-- Claim to fame: Learned the hazards of conspicuous consumption
In 1661, Fouquet invited the young French king, Louis XIV, to a party at his magnificent chateau on the
outskirts of Paris, Vaux le Vicomte. Fouquet proudly displayed his grounds (dotted with more than 250
fountains) and treated the king to a play written especially for the occasion by Moliere. Louis XIV was so
peeved by the wealth of a nonroyal that several weeks later he ordered his marshals to arrest Fouquet for
embezzlement. After the king sentenced Fouquet to prison and confiscated his property, he hired Fouquet's
architects and designers to build Versailles.
Yodoya Tatsugoro (died around 1705)
-- Occupation: Merchant
-- Source of wealth: Trading in silk, rice
-- Assets: Farms, gold, luxury goods
-- Claim to fame: Amassed a fortune so big, it was considered "unbecoming"
The Tatsugoro family of Japan got rich as silk traders and rice agents. Yodoya, a member of the fifth
generation of the family, became so wealthy that the austere Shogunate confiscated his fortune in 1705,
claiming that it was unbecoming. The truth was, many government officials owed Tatsugoro money -- always
a dangerous state of affairs. Tatsugoro's worldly goods at the time of his confiscation included 250 farms and
fields; more than 146,000 pounds of gold currency; 583,000 pounds of silver currency; and warehouses of
carpets, crystals and other luxury goods.
Aurangzeb (1618-1707)

--- Page 47 ---
Page 47 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Occupation: Moghul ruler of India
-- Source of wealth: Inheritance
-- Assets: Gold
-- Claim to fame: Never backed away from a fight
Aurangzeb got the throne the old-fashioned way: He defeated his three brothers and threw his father in jail.
Aurangzeb's annual revenue was said to have been more than 10 times that of his contemporary, Louis XIV.
In 1676, the price of gold suddenly dropped relative to silver, supposedly because Aurangzeb was spending
the family gold to finance military campaigns in western India and Afghanistan. Although the empire reached
its greatest size during his reign, Aurangzeb's persecution of Hindu subjects fatally weakened Muslim Moghul
control.
Osei Tutu (ruled about 1670-1712)
-- Occupation: Ruler of the Ashanti Empire in what is now southern Ghana
-- Source of wealth: Gun running, slave trading
-- Assets: Opulent court
-- Claim to fame: Was sheltered by parasols as big as trees
Trading with Europe and Islamic North Africa, Osei Tutu filled the royal chest with more than 400,000 ounces
of gold. He instituted gold dust as the official currency, and his authority was symbolized by the Golden
Stool, a throne that was said to have descended from the heavens into the king's lap. Osei Tutu also supplied
slaves to British and Dutch traders in exchange for firearms. He enjoyed an opulent outdoor court, sheltered
under parasols as big as trees, according to accounts of the day, and invited his hundreds of thousands of
subjects to an annual yam ceremony.
John Law (1671-1729)
-- Occupation: Financier
-- Source of wealth: Banks, stocks
-- Assets: 15 country estates
-- Claim to fame: Created the "Mississippi Bubble"
At the height of his power, Law had more authority than King Louis XV. He controlled France's foreign trade,
mints, revenue, national debt and half of what is now the contiguous U.S. In France, Law owned 15 country
estates, most of the undeveloped land around Paris, a library of 50,000 books and millions of shares of
securities. A dashing Scotsman, he fled England in 1694 after killing a rival in a duel. He traveled through
Europe, playing the casinos and studying finance, and then went to France, where he set up a bank based on
paper money and credit instead of gold. He also established the Mississippi Company to exploit the
resources of French-controlled territories in America. To sell shares in his company, he hired unemployed
men to dress as miners and march through Parisian streets bearing shovels and axes, as if they were on their
way to dig for America's great wealth. Investors snapped up the stock and stuffed their money into Law's
bank. The shares, issued at 500 livres, rose to 10,000 livres in less than a year. But in 1720, the "Mississippi
Bubble" exploded as panicked investors withdrew their shares. Law fled to Venice in disgrace and puttered
away his remaining years at the gaming tables.
Sir Robert Clive (1725-1774)
-- Occupation: Soldier of fortune
-- Source of wealth: Payoffs from vanquished people
-- Assets: Cash, jewels, land
-- Claim to fame: Contender for title of richest man in history
"Clive of India," as he was known, wrested Bengal away from the French on behalf of the British East India
Co. in 1757. As payment, Sir Robert exacted from the Moghul ruler, Mir Jafar, a personal cash reward
equivalent to more than $140 million in today's dollars, a Moghul title of nobility and the rights to land around
Calcutta. Some people believe Sir Robert was the richest man ever, if his wealth is measured relative to the

incomes of his contemporaries. He invested in diamonds, which he furtively shipped back to his home country
of England for resale, and reinvested in the East India Co. In his two terms as Bengal's governor, he reduced
corruption and inefficiency, but when he took his huge fortune home to England in 1767, the government
accused him of embezzlement. He was acquitted in 1773. The following year he committed suicide.
Richard Arkwright (1732-1792)
-- Occupation: Inventor and industrialist
-- Source of wealth: Cotton mills
-- Assets: Cash, property
-- Claim to fame: Amassed one of the first factory fortunes
Arkwright invented a water-powered cotton-spinning machine that became the basis for huge cotton mills and
eventually the modern factory system. Born in England to a large, poor family, Arkwright trained to be a
barber and wig maker, roaming the countryside buying the hair of girls for wigs. By 1782, he had capital of
GBP 200,000, or some $17 million in today's dollars, and employed 5,000 workers. Once he got rich, he
traveled in style. He "arrived at Derby, accompanied by his javelin men. . .dressed in the richest liveries ever
seen here," a newspaper reported. "The trumpeters were mounted on gray horses and elegantly dressed in
scarlet and gold." Although knighted in 1786, Arkwright still strove to overcome his humble origins; starting at
age 50, he devoted at least two hours a day to the study of spelling and grammar.
Ho-Shen (1750-1799)
-- Occupation: Chinese emperor's right-hand man
-- Source of wealth: Graft, kickbacks
-- Assets: Gold, silver, furs
-- Claim to fame: So greedy he stole food from soldiers
Handsome, witty, self-confident and incredibly corrupt, Ho-Shen entered the court of Emperor Kao-tsung in
1772 as a bodyguard but quickly became the aging emperor's confidante. He strengthened those ties by
marrying the emperor's youngest and favorite daughter, giving Ho-Shen the power to make or break other
officials. Because nobody dared to refuse his demands or bring charges against him, he became fabulously
wealthy. Serving as customs superintendent, Ho-Shen had easy access to luxury goods; he also persuaded
the increasingly senile emperor to prolong a bloody military campaign, pocketing vast sums allocated to the
army while the soldiers starved. When the emperor died in 1799, his heir immediately arrested Ho-Shen and
confiscated his silver, gold and precious stones.
Ho-Shen, who died in prison, had at least 60 million ounces of silver, 70,000 furs and a gold table service of
4,288 pieces.
Stephen Girard (1750-1831)
-- Occupation: Banker
-- Source of wealth: Money lending
-- Assets: Millions of dollars
-- Claim to fame: Richest man in America at the time of his death
Born in France, Girard was a shipper who arrived in Philadelphia in 1776. There he sold his ship and cargo
and opened up a small grocery store, earning a small fortune by secretly trading with the British during the
Revolutionary War. Using his earnings to start his own bank in 1812, he helped the federal government
finance the War of 1812, for a 10% commission. A childless loner (his wife was committed to a mental
asylum), Girard lived in a dingy house, kept a cage of singing canaries on his desk and was a die-hard
vegetarian. To his contemporaries, Girard seemed like an embittered, crusty miser, but he surprised them by
leaving most of his $7.5 million estate to a school for orphaned boys. His fortune, adjusted for inflation,
would be an estimated $110 million today.
Nathan Rothschild (1777-1836)
-- Occupation: Banker

--- Page 49 ---
Page 49 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Source of wealth: Stock market
-- Assets: Cash
-- Claim to fame: Bet on the right side at Waterloo
"Money is the god of our time, and Rothschild is his prophet," wrote the German philosopher Heinrich Heine.
Rothschild was the son of Mayer Rothschild (1744-1812), who rose from the ghetto of Frankfurt to become
banker to Prince William of Prussia and brought his son into the business. When Napoleon invaded Prussia,
the prince sought to get his money out of the country. So he entrusted it to young Nathan Rothschild, then
working in London as a banker. Rothschild invested the money in the Napoleonic Wars, smuggling it to
Wellington in Spain. Meanwhile, he developed an impressive messenger service of riders, ships and carrier
pigeons, and in 1815, he was the first banker to hear the news from Waterloo. Rothschild immediately sold
large blocks of stock, convincing other investors -- falsely -- that the British had lost. As prices fell, his agents
bought up the stock at rock-bottom prices. From the end of the Napoleonic Wars until his death, the corpulent
Rothschild worked in a corner of the London Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, his four brothers established banks
in Vienna, Naples and Paris, making the Rothschilds the most powerful financial family in Europe.
Howqua (a.k.a. Wu Bingjian) (1769-1843)
-- Occupation: Trader
-- Source of wealth: Import-export, money lending
-- Assets: Millions of silver dollars
-- Claim to fame: Richest businessman in the world in his time
Howqua's father was one of a handful of Chinese merchants permitted to trade silk and porcelain with
foreigners. Howqua's family accepted payment only in silver; they didn't see any foreign goods they wanted.
In 1789, Howqua took over the business from his father. He lent enormous sums to foreign traders (up to a
million silver dollars at a time) in exchange for a share of the shipments. He was also a public benefactor,
donating 1.1 million silver dollars toward reparations after the First Opium War. Howqua was so widely known
in his time that his portrait still hangs in several Salem, Mass., and Newport, R.I., mansions built by American
merchants who traded with him.
John Jacob Astor (1763-1848)
-- Occupation: Trader
-- Source of wealth: Furs, real estate
-- Assets: Land
-- Claim to fame: Rich but uncouth opportunist
Born a butcher's son in Germany, Astor arrived in New York City at age 20 and got a job with a fur merchant,
beating the dust and bugs out of pelts. Gradually he built his own fur-trading business, and also began
investing in real estate. By 1820, his American Fur Co. monopolized the fur trade east of the Rockies. In
1834, he tired of fur and focused on real estate. Astor scoured foreclosure notices for bargains and kept his
ears open for gossip of landowners in trouble; he bought Aaron Burr's homestead after Burr killed Alexander
Hamilton in a duel. Astor's guiding rule was, "Buy the acre; sell the lot." Despite his wealth, Astor wasn't
immediately accepted into New York society. He spoke with a thick German accent, supposedly ate peas with
a knife and, on one occasion, wiped his fingers on the sleeves of his dinner hostess. But he married into a
prestigious New York family, the Brevoorts, which oiled the social machine. So did the $20 million he left at
his death, equivalent to $336 million today.
Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794-1877)
-- Occupation: Shipper
-- Source of wealth: Boats, railroads
-- Assets: Several homes, a yacht
-- Claim to fame: Foul-mouthed ferry-boat captain thumbed his nose at the world
Vanderbilt rose from a humble Staten Island farm family to become the wealthiest man of his time. As a teen,
he became "the Commodore" while piloting passengers around New York harbor. In 1818, he started running

steamships, then a recent invention, between New Jersey and New York. Although New York had granted
Robert Fulton and Robert Livingston a monopoly to run the route, Vanderbilt kept ferrying passengers -- with
the law in constant pursuit. Vanderbilt also struck his own kind of gold in the gold rush, shuttling prospectors
to the West on a new steamship route that included transit across Nicaragua. At age 70, he entered the
railroad business, which he soon dominated. He built several stunning homes, including a mansion on Staten
Island and a stately townhouse on Washington Place in Manhattan. Vanderbilt commissioned a 270-foot,
steam-powered yacht with velvet furniture, 10 staterooms and a marble-walled dining room. His fortune at his
death was estimated at $105 million, or some $1.5 billion in today's dollars. But all of Vanderbilt's riches
couldn't buy a place for him in elite New York society: He swore constantly, and spat tobacco juice on the
carpet.
Cecil Rhodes (1853-1902)
-- Occupation: Imperialist
-- Source of wealth: Diamonds
-- Assets: Political power
-- Claim to fame: Established scholarships to promote the British Empire
As a teen, the sickly Rhodes was sent from his home in England to South Africa for its climate, and he soon
caught "diamond fever." He discovered a vast lode of diamonds at Kimberley and founded De Beers Mining
Co. to mine it. Rhodes limited the production of his mine and raised prices; through acquisition, he controlled
90% of the world's diamond supply by 1891. Rhodes didn't live high on the hog for an imperialist; he used his
money to extol the virtues of British rule outside Britain. He ran for the Cape Parliament in 1881, was prime
minister of the Cape colony from 1890 to 1896, and founded Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), his own colony in
Africa, for mineral speculation. He spent heavily on politics, but left enough when he died to endow the
Rhodes scholarships with #3 million, which would translate into roughly $250 million today.
Hetty Green (1835-1916)
-- Occupation: Investor
-- Source of wealth: Financial markets
-- Assets: Cash, securities
-- Claim to fame: Known as "The Witch of Wall Street"
Green took an inheritance of nearly $10 million (worth some $185 million in today's dollars) when her
ship-owner father died and started investing in the financial markets. She scored her first major success after
the Civil War, buying depreciated U.S. government bonds from skittish investors. Her maxim was simple --
"buy cheap and sell dear" -- and she had an instinct for knowing when which was which. When she married a
wealthy trader named Edward Green, she insisted on a prenuptial agreement that kept their finances
separate. Once again, she proved prophetic: When he went bankrupt 18 years later, Edward listed as his
assets "seven dollars and a gold watch." Hetty herself lived in cheap boarding houses in Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Hoboken, N.J., and took public transportation to her Wall Street "office" -- the vault of Chemical
National Bank. There she sat on the floor, clipping coupons, reading the financial news and listening to loan
requests from some of Wall Street's most eminent bankers. Even Green's son suffered from her cheapness.
When he injured his knee, Green refused to pay for a doctor and treated the injury herself. Two years later,
when her son's knee still hadn't healed, Green dressed him in rags and pretended to be a charity patient.
When the doctor learned who she was and demanded payment, she left with the boy. Several years later, his
leg had to be amputated. When Green died in 1916, she left some $100 million, equal to about $1.5 billion
today.
Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919)
-- Occupation: Industrialist
-- Source of wealth: Steel
-- Assets: Hundreds of millions of dollars
-- Claim to fame: Gave most of his money away
Born in Scotland to a poor weaver, Carnegie emigrated to the U.S. in
1848 and worked as a superintendent for the Pennsylvania Railroad. He

--- Page 51 ---
Page 51 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
started investing in iron manufacturing, railroad cars and oil,
flourishing industries in the post-Civil War economy. By 1873, he had
moved into steel, improving quality and lowering costs. By 1900, his
Carnegie Steel Co. produced a quarter of the steel in the U.S. and
controlled iron mines, ore ships and railroads. Led by Carnegie, the
U.S. surpassed Britain as the world's leading supplier of steel. At the
age of 65, Carnegie sold his interests for more than $250 million and
retired to his castle in Scotland. He donated $5 million (equivalent to
$94 million now) to a pension fund for his workers, and over the next
two decades, he gave away an estimated $350 million ($7 billion in
today's dollars) which was most of the rest of his money, funding 2,811
public libraries, 7,689 church organs and even a lake designed for
rowing, Princeton University's Lake Carnegie. "There is no idol,"
Carnegie once wrote, "more debasing than the worship of money."
John D. Rockefeller (1839-1937)
-- Occupation: Industrialist
-- Source of wealth: Oil refining
-- Assets: $900 million
-- Claim to fame: Capitalist, robber baron, philanthropist
Rockefeller was born on a farm in upstate New York, and as a boy, he demonstrated an early interest in
capitalism, supposedly buying candy in bulk, dividing it into small portions and selling it to his siblings. As a
young man, he became interested in the oil boom in nearby Titusville, Pa., but rather than join the cutthroat
drillers, he moved into refining, where there were fewer competitors. By 1870 his Standard Oil Co. had
gobbled up competitors in the region or price-squeezed them to death. Rockefeller gradually absorbed other
competitors, and by the 1880s, his company controlled 95% of the country's refineries. But in 1890, Congress
passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which led to the breakup of Standard Oil after the turn of the century.
Rockefeller's net worth peaked at about $900 million in 1913, or almost $15 billion in today's dollars.
Rockefeller's net worth amounted to a staggering 2.5% of gross domestic product at the time, notes Ron
Chernow, author of "Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller." Unlike other robber barons of the era, Rockefeller
didn't flaunt his wealth, although he owned large estates in New York, Florida, Maine, New Jersey and Ohio.
His philanthropy totaled more than $500 million ($8.3 billion in today's dollars) and included the founding of
the University of Chicago and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) in
New York.
Don Simon Iturbi Patino (1860-1947)
-- Occupation: Miner
-- Source of wealth: Tinfoil
-- Assets: Mansions, cash
-- Claim to fame: Turned a pickax into a palace
Patino, who was of part Indian descent, was working as a clerk at a mining-supply store in an impoverished
Bolivian city when a customer in debt offered to pay off his bill with the deed to an old tin mine. Young Patino
took a burro and a pickax to the mountains and eventually discovered he owned the richest tin deposit on
earth. After World War I, Patino profited on the sale of almost every product that used tinfoil in the U.S., from
gum to cigarettes. His wealth gave him political power, and he served as ambassador to Spain and France.
Even so, he was shunned by the Bolivian aristocracy because of his mixed roots, and he and his family
moved to France, where they were welcomed by the European elite. He built mansions in Paris and Biarritz;
another, in Nice, was described as "hideous beyond belief," with an amphitheater for orchestral recitals, huge
parks filled with palm trees and a reconstruction of a Greek temple in ruins. Although he never again lived in
Bolivia, Patino built three enormous palaces there "just in case," and was buried in a blue marble tomb high in
the mountains of his birth.
Calouste Gulbenkian (1869-1955)
-- Occupation: Oil man
-- Source of wealth: Royalties

--- Page 52 ---
Page 52 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
-- Assets: Old master paintings, tapestries, illuminated manuscripts
-- Claim to fame: Nicknamed "Mr. Five Percent"
Son of a Constantinople merchant, Gulbenkian by 1907 had combined Royal Dutch Oil and Shell Oil,
emerging with a large block of stock in the greatest petroleum company in the world. Gulbenkian somehow
won favor with Sultan Abdul Hamid I ("Abdul the Damned"), the Ottoman tyrant who massacred Armenians
but spared Gulbenkian, even allowing him to exploit the rich oil fields of Mesopotamia, now Iraq. After World
War I and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, Gulbenkian negotiated an agreement to broker all of the
oil Iran sold to the West for a 5% commission. This arrangement gave him his nickname -- "Mr. Five Percent"
-- and incalculable wealth in oil royalties. Gulbenkian, a longtime British citizen, supposedly enjoyed a
personal "harem" of young women, but his relationship with his son, Nubar, wasn't so enjoyable. Nubar sued
his father, claiming his father had promised him a piece of the business. The costly lawsuit was eventually
settled out of court. Gulbenkian amassed a collection of old master paintings, as well as Turkish carpets,
tapestries, illuminated manuscripts and coins, and left a fortune reportedly worth $1 billion, or $6.1 billion
today.
Mir Osman Ali Khan ("Nizam of Hyderabad") (1886-1967)
-- Occupation: Dynastic ruler
-- Source of wealth: Taxation
-- Assets: Gold, jewels, soap
-- Claim to fame: Rats ate his bank notes
The seventh and last ruler of the Sif Jahi dynasty in India, the Nizam ruled Hyderabad, a region larger than
England. His reign came to an end in 1948 when India gained independence and forced the princely states to
merge with the republic. Considered to be one of the richest men in the world because of his vast reserves of
jewels and gold, he led a simple life, wearing tattered clothing and eating his meals in the bazaar. He was a
generous philanthropist, donating to hundreds of universities and hospitals regardless of caste and religion,
and funding large-scale public-works projects. When he died, investigators found strong rooms filled with
bank notes eaten through by rats.
T.V. Soong (1894-1971)
-- Occupation: Financier, government official
-- Source of wealth: Banking, fraud
-- Assets: Blue-chip stocks, cash
-- Claim to fame: Used Chinese treasury to invest in General Motors Corp.
An official of the Chinese Nationalist Government from 1927 to 1949, Soong was said to be the richest man in
the world during the 1940s. If not the wealthiest, he was surely one of the most powerful. The son of a
prominent Methodist industrialist, Soong graduated from Harvard University and quickly rose in the financial
world as a banker. In 1923, he financed the Nationalist party of Sun Yat-sen, his brother-in-law. Soong
established the Central Bank of China, which became the government treasury in 1924 when Soong was
appointed the minister of finance. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek -- Sun Yat-sen's rival and Soong's other
brother-in-law -- rose to power, and Soong served as his finance minister. He was appointed minister of
foreign affairs in 1942, and became a master at mustering Washington's support for China. Using his easy
access to the Chinese treasury, he made large personal investments in foreign stock, including holdings in
General Motors Corp. and DuPont Co. A wartime dossier on Soong states that he "started out his public
career with rather limited resources and [by January 1943] had amassed over $70 million" (worth about $660
million in today's dollars). When the Soviets captured mainland China in 1949, Soong moved to San
Francisco, where he kept a lower profile.
J. Paul Getty (1892-1976)
-- Occupation: Oil man
-- Source of wealth: Drilling
-- Assets: Faux Roman villa in Malibu
-- Claim to fame: Had a pay phone for guests

--- Page 53 ---
Page 53 of 100 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Getty was born into oil money: His father, George, owned a drilling company. J. Paul, who really wanted to be
a professor or diplomat, was puttering around the oil fields one day when he hit a gusher on the first hole he
drilled ("pure luck," he called it). By age 24, he had made his first million and decided to retire. But after his
father had a stroke, Getty went back to business, buying shares of oil stock at Depression-era prices. Twenty
years later, Getty controlled an oil empire. A playboy intellectual, with interests in art, literature, historic
preservation and night life, Getty lived most of his life abroad (to pay lower taxes). He built a reproduction
Roman villa in Malibu, Calif., which critics called the "phony villa," but the house was, and still is, popular with
the public. Getty's fortune was between $2 billion and $6 billion (the equivalent of $5.7 billion to $17 billion
now), but he was also notoriously cheap. He was said to never leave a meeting first, so he wouldn't have to
pay for a taxi, and he kept a pay phone at his London home for his guests' phone calls.
Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei (1946-)
-- Occupation: Potentate
-- Source of wealth: Oil, natural gas
-- Assets: $30 billion
-- Claim to fame: Big party thrower
Latest ruling member of one of the world's oldest dynasties, dating back 600 years, the Sultan of Brunei is
described on the country's official Web site as a "working monarch" who is "caring and benevolent." He also
knows how to have a good time. On his 25th anniversary as sultan in 1992, he rode a gilded chariot pulled by
40 men through his nation's capital. In 1996, the sultan celebrated his 50th birthday with monthlong festivities
for the entire nation. The present he gave his subjects on his birthday last year: a salary increase of up to
14% for all public employees (80% of all Brunei workers). The sultan can afford it. Though his realm is tiny --
the Southeast Asian nation is about the size of Delaware and has a population of just 280,000 -- it enjoys vast
reserves of oil and natural gas.
Bill Gates (1955-)
-- Occupation: Software executive
-- Source of wealth: Microsoft stock
-- Assets: $75 billion
--Claim to fame: Richest-ever college dropout
He is both the most admired and despised executive of his era. A geeky kid, Gates worked as a programmer
from age 13 and co-founded Microsoft Corp. at age 20 with boyhood pal Paul Allen after dropping out of
Harvard. Microsoft took off when International Business Machines Corp. chose the fledgling company's
operating system, MS-DOS, to run its PCs. Ruthlessly competitive, Gates since has moved Microsoft into
every PC software nook, squeezing out smaller rivals and drawing the ire of antitrust regulators. Gates has
spent lavishly building a mansion and snapping up electronic rights to art masterpieces, but also recently
donated $100 million for immunization programs for children in developing countries.

Sultan Murat III was ruler of his world in the 16th century, enthroned in a white-domed palace with 300 rooms
for his wives and concubines and 4,000 stalls for his horses. But when it comes to creature comforts, the
Turkish sultan's palace was nothing compared with those of modern millionaires like Leona Helmsley. When
she had a mansion built in Arizona, Ms. Helmsley included faucets of 24-karat gold, a glass-walled dining
room overlooking a waterfall, a film-projection system that lowers from the ceiling, and an underwater sound
system for the swimming pool.
What defines luxury has changed drastically over the past 1,000 years. Monarchs and moguls have always
had scads of servants to pamper and protect them, but generally were expected to house and feed their
retinues in vast compounds. So peace and quiet -- things most middle-class Americans take for granted --
were in short supply. So, too, were comfort and privacy. A powerful, rich person might sit all day on a gilded
throne and sleep on silk sheets, but was always on display. Never could the rich experience the total
relaxation of modern wage slaves, channel-surfing from their recliners in ratty sweatsuits.
Palaces were primitive in other ways, too. Many of the niceties of modern home life were invented in the past
two centuries -- not just air conditioning and electric lights and appliances, but also flush toilets and even
window screens, for example. So until recently, even the grandest residences tended to be dim, drafty and
vulnerable to vermin.
But comfort wasn't the goal.
Palaces were built to awe, and to last. They were monuments as much as domiciles, works of art and
inspiration in a time before mass-media amusements. Here is a look at palatial home life over the past 1,000
years.
England
Windsor Castle
Now a compound covering 13 acres and displaying some of the world's finest artwork, architecture and
furnishings, Windsor Castle started as an earthwork-and-timber fortification built by William the Conqueror
around 1080 to guard the Thames River. Its layout was simple -- a mound, or "motte," surrounded by a
fenced yard, or "bailey." But its site, near a 4,800-acre royal hunting ground and about 20 miles west of
London, was considered so favorable, his successors turned it into a permanent residence.
Although the residence now has every modern comfort -- along with elaborate plaster carvings, gilded trim,
and damask wall and window coverings -- for the first three centuries of its existence it was a humble affair,
and life within it was hardly luxurious.
There were improvements made during that time. In 1170, Henry II starting replacing the original timber
structures with stone. Setting the style for succeeding architects, he had a round stone tower with crenelated
battlements built on the raised motte William had created, and added two sets of apartments -- one with a hall
to receive his court, another just for his family. Over the next two centuries, his successors added five round
towers to the outside wall, expanded the royal apartments, and created a chapel and a great hall for the
Knights of the Garter.
But it was still a Norman castle -- thick-walled, dark and dank, says Lisa Reilly, associate professor of
architectural history at the University of Virginia. The only light came from candles and torches, and though
rich tapestries covered the walls and expensive glass was used in some windows, they weren't enough to
dispel the constant drafts. Floors were cold, too, because carpets were considered too precious and delicate
to throw on the floor -- they were more likely to be used as wall or table coverings. And smoke and smells
from meat roasting on spits in the huge fireplaces permeated the air.

Roasting meat was one of the better smells in the castle. Baths were infrequent, and even the elite wore
clothes a long time before washing them. Built-in latrines jutted out of the wall over the moat, which
consequently reeked. People casually let food drop to the rush-strewn floor, where, if not picked up by the
resident hounds or falcons, it rotted. "It was pretty gross," says Prof. Reilly.
Medieval courts were constantly on the move, so rulers could keep a high profile with their subjects, and they
carried their most precious furnishings with them, down to the gold plates and crystal goblets. Entertainments
tended to be portable, too, and included hunting, jousting, falconry, cards, dice, chess, needlework and lawn
bowling.
For all their power, rulers rarely had any time to themselves. Hundreds lived in the castle, and even at
bedtime, when the royals retired to their fur-covered featherbed, surrounded by a linen curtain, they weren't
alone: Servants bedded down in the same room on trundle beds, alert to any royal whisperings.
"The idea of privacy had yet to evolve," Prof. Reilly says.
China
Imperial Palace
The constant threat of barbarian invasion caused Chinese emperors to move their capital a number of times
early in the millennium. And although Beijing was the site from the years 1260 to 1368, it wasn't until the
capital returned there in the early 15th century that Yong Le, the third Ming emperor, created a permanent
imperial residence. Built by some 200,000 laborers, this in time became an 8,886-room complex on a
rectangle measuring 3,150 by 2,460 feet. Over the next five centuries, the 180-acre compound was home to
24 successive emperors. Although it was known as the Forbidden City, many servants and tradespeople
came and went daily; only 9,000 people resided there full time.
Architects used the ancient Chinese philosophy of feng shui -- literally "wind-water," it's the art of arranging
buildings and furnishings for good fortune and success -- to lay out the palace and grounds in harmony with
nature. Most buildings face south to benefit from sunny yang and counteract harmful yin from the north, such
as cold winds, bad spirits and barbarian invaders. Streets run either north-south or east-west. Moats, walls
and four gates at the cardinal points -- north, south, east and west -- protected the city from the outside world.
The buildings, made from timber, brick, stone and marble, were less than two stories tall, so as not to disturb
the spirits of the air. In the inner reaches of the city, ceremonial pavilions and three palaces reserved for the
emperor and his wives and concubines were decorated with gilt and carvings of dragons, cranes and other
"lucky" beasts. In its early years, the palace probably had translucent paper windows, rather than glass -- and
no screens to keep out insects, of course.
"They had servants to swat the flies," says Richard Stamps, a professor of Chinese studies at Oakland
University in Rochester, Mich.
The palaces were constantly warmed and perfumed by braziers in which incense was burned -- a reasonable
measure, given that the outer courtyards held livestock, including pigs and sheep, and the emperor's 48
elephants. But conditions weren't as unhygienic as in some Western cities, thanks to a system of crude
slot-in-the-ground toilets, septic tanks and waste drains, according to Prof. Stamps. "Farmers would take
away the waste and spread it on their fields for fertilizer," he says.
Ritual ruled the emperor's day. Typically, he arose each day at 3 a.m. and received visitors or presided over
parades and ceremonies nonstop until lunchtime. At noon he dined alone. Because the main kitchens were
so far away from the emperor's quarters, his food often arrived cold, prompting one emperor to have a small
warming kitchen built near his dining room.
But imperial banquets were worse -- tedious affairs for both the emperor, on whom all eyes were riveted, and
for the guests, who were expected to bang their heads on the floor whenever the host said anything amusing
or even when he was served something to drink. According to "The Forbidden City: Center of Imperial China"
by Gilles Beguin and Dominique Morel, an 18th-century priest once complained after attending an imperial
banquet: "There are those magnificent meals where a European dies of hunger. The way in which he is
forced to sit on the ground on a mat with crossed legs is awkward; neither the wine nor the dishes that are
offered are to his taste . . . . One would initially say that it was an idol to whom a sacrifice was going to be
made rather than a prince to whom food was being served."
The emperor and his retinue enjoyed beautiful, albeit artificial, gardens (trees out of season were sometimes
decorated with silk blossoms), numerous temples and shrines, a library and a dozen theaters. But because
he spent his days in ceremonies, was often carried on a covered litter called a palanquin and was required to
nibble on multicourse meals, the emperor had limited opportunities to exercise -- one reason that the various
thrones dotting the complex, made of gold or jade and padded with yellow silk, were exceptionally capacious.

Turkey
Topkapi Palace
The spectacular view continues to be of the confluence of the Golden Horn, the Bosporus Strait and the Sea
of Marmara, but Topkapi Palace itself has been been through many transformations. It has been swept over
the years by four major fires and endless renovations and expansions. Although Sultan Mehmet the
Conqueror moved to Topkapi in 1465, much of the current compound, including the famous harem, was built
by Sultan Murat III in the late 1500s.
The 54-acre walled compound embodied a new idea for the Ottomans: that the sultan was sacred and should
keep his distance from the masses. But though the sultans kept aloof, they hardly lived alone. For the 500
years the Ottoman sultans resided there, it was a swarming place, though exceptionally well-organized.
"Even the horses seem to know where they are," wrote a traveler named Tourenfort in 1700.
Within the compound's walls, many stone kiosks recall nomadic tents. Most of the buildings are low, with
overhanging eaves; they make the palace look as though it is clinging to the side of the cliff. The compound
included 10 mosques, 14 baths, and two hospitals, plus an armory, a mint, a school, a circumcision room, a
fountain to cleanse the blood from the executioner's ax, various dormitories for servants, and a zoo containing
such exotic wild animals as lions and elephants. A series of kitchens served 5,000 full-time residents, who
consumed more than 300 sheep or goats and 650 fowl daily, nibbled on a new cheese called feta, and
sampled fruits and other delicacies brought in from all over the empire. More than 100 cartloads of wood had
to be hauled in daily to feed the kitchen's roaring stoves.
In an inner compound, away from the clatter of the kitchens and the bustle of tradesmen who served the
palace, 300 warren-like rooms in the well-guarded harem held some 2,000 people -- the sultan's mother,
wives, concubines and children. Since many of the occupants spent much of their lives sitting on silk rugs or
pillows, windows were placed low, and the rooms were on raised bases to maximize views of the courtyard
gardens. The sultan's mother and wives had several apartments, but most concubines slept three or four to a
room.
The harem surrounded the apartments of the sultan, richly decorated in brocades, murals, stained-glass
windows and intricately carved furniture, with many fountains that made it difficult to eavesdrop on his
conversations. (Some visitors complained that it was uncomfortable to walk on the Oriental carpets, which
were sewn with jewels.) The sultan's domed bedroom was warmed by a bronze fireplace and window
shutters inlaid with mother-of-pearl; in the basement was a pool fed by various fountains, which functioned as
a cool summer retreat.
Beautiful as it was, Topkapi was nevertheless a prison for all who lived there. Sultans did as they pleased,
sending rival brothers and sons to the executioner, or banishing them to a life of forced ease in the harem.
But even the sultan's life was circumscribed by constant calls to prayer and by idle pursuits such as archery
or watching fireworks, according to a Venetian visitor to the court of Murat III in 1585 as described in
"Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: the Topkapi Palace in the 15th and 16th Centuries" by Gulru
Necipoglu. "The sultan does not, in my opinion, live so desirable a life," wrote the visitor, "for he stays almost
constantly enclosed in his seraglio in the company of eunuchs, boys, dwarfs, mutes and slaves, which seems
to me almost as bad as [the company of] women . . . ."
Russia
Catherine Palace
When Peter the Great established his capital in St. Petersburg in 1703, he attracted a number of Italian
architects who unleashed a wave of baroque and neoclassical building unrivaled anywhere in Europe. Two of
his imperial successors, Elizabeth and Catherine II (the Great), shared his passion for building, and between
them erected a number of monumental palaces.
One, known in different eras as the Great Palace, the Ekaterinsky Palace or the Catherine Palace, was at
Tsarkoe Selo about 25 miles from the city. It was named for Peter the Great's second wife, and Elizabeth's
mother, Catherine I.
The palace was 978 feet long, with two small wings of about 50 feet each. Almost overpowering in scale, its
three-story facade was broken up by a series of balustrades, columns and pediments. The stuccoed walls
were turquoise, the columns white, and all the exterior ornamentation and statues were gilded. (European
contemporaries scoffed at the glittering effect the original architects created -- an English traveler called it
"most tawdry" -- and Catherine II had most of the gilding removed after Elizabeth died.)

--- Page 57 ---

Meant to impress rather than to repel invaders, the palace had a purely decorative drawbridge and parklike
grounds ringed only with iron fences and canals. The parks contained a number of art galleries and pavilions,
as well as a theater, cold baths, a church and an orangery.
Catherine II used the palace as her main summer residence, and despite her distaste for gilding, spared little
expense ornamenting her interiors in the latest neoclassical style. In her private apartments, walls were
covered with lapis lazuli and damask silk, and parquet floors were inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The walls of her
own bedroom were made of milky-white glass, punctuated by lilac-colored glass columns, mirrors and
Wedgwood medallions.
The palace sported some state-of-the-art conveniences, such as ceramic-tile-covered wood-burning stoves
that were both more efficient and less smoky than traditional open fireplaces, and private toilets. But there
was still no running water -- for either the toilets or the rest of the palace -- and food was brought in from a
separate building by serfs.
Still, imperial life was more relaxed for Catherine II than it had been for earlier rulers, in Russia and
elsewhere. Though an estimated 400 people lived in the palace when the court was in residence, many
servants lived outside the palace grounds (which covered 1,483 acres and included 100 buildings), thus
reducing the number of prying eyes. And livestock was banished from the parks, cutting down on noise and
filth.
Informal entertainments such as outdoor concerts and picnics were gaining in popularity. These were hardly
rustic affairs, though: According to William Craft Brumfield, professor of Russian studies at Tulane University
in New Orleans, servants set tables on the lower levels of the outdoor pavilions and then winched them up to
the elite guests on the upper levels, so as not to disturb the guests' contemplation of nature.
Catherine II considered herself an enlightened ruler and adopted many new ideas, such as the notion of
privacy -- at least for herself. Indeed, she even placed her own apartments at the opposite end of the
immense palace from those of her son, the Grand Duke Paul. "Nothing was allowed to intrude on her, not
even her children," says Prof. Brumfield.
U.S.
Biltmore Estate
By the late 19th century, American tycoons were living as lavishly as monarchs. One who decided to build a
country palace worthy of any prince was George Washington Vanderbilt, grandson of industrialist Cornelius
Vanderbilt. Though now open to the public, the estate is still in family hands.
A linguist, musician and patron of the arts, George Vanderbilt built his 250-room mansion on 125,000 acres
overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains. (The estate today is a mere 8,000 acres.) Richard Morris Hunt, a
pre-eminent architect, designed the house to look like a castle from the Loire Valley, and Frederick Law
Olmsted, the famous landscape architect, created formal and informal gardens on 250 acres. Mr. Vanderbilt
had a special railroad spur built to deliver the tons of Indiana limestone and other materials needed at the
construction site, as well as the massive collection of antiques, artwork and Oriental carpets used to furnish
the completed house.
Begun in 1890 and finished five years later, the mansion was probably the most innovative residence of its
day. It used some of Thomas Edison's first light bulbs, and had other new electrical wonders, such as two
elevators, a fire-alarm system, a rotisserie, refrigeration systems, and call boxes for servants. It also sported
such state-of-the-art features as 10 telephones and central heating powered by a huge steam furnace. Air
conditioning hadn't yet been developed, but Biltmore had electric fans, a new invention. The 43 bathrooms
provided hot water on demand, a remarkable innovation.
Biltmore was also a prototype of what has now become a common sight in wealthy neighborhoods: the
pleasure palace. For recreation, there was an indoor swimming pool, billiard room, bowling alley and
gymnasium. For entertaining, there was a banquet hall that seated 64 guests, a conservatory filled with
tropical flowers, a library of 23,000 books, and a number of sitting rooms filled with paintings by such artists
as Albrecht Durer, John Singer Sargent and Pierre Auguste Renoir.
As much as possible, the estate was set up to be self-sufficient, growing many of its own vegetables and
raising cattle to provide beef and dairy products. And while visitors to palaces in previous centuries might
have had to endure the sights and smells of various support systems, at Biltmore such things were kept
hidden or at a distance. Even the three kitchens and the laundry were sequestered on a lower level, where
guests were unlikely to stumble upon them.
The protocol of the era precluded the sort of dress-down comfort modern moguls favor; everyone at Biltmore
was expected to wear elegant gowns or black tie to dinner and to behave with decorum even when at play.

--- Page 58 ---

But in every other way, Biltmore's owner achieved what royalty couldn't, even over the course of 1,000 years
-- a paradise free of both the trappings of state and the unsettling view of the workers and machinery that
made all the luxuries possible. Pauline Merrill, a guest at Biltmore in 1905, summed up her visit in terms that
have, in effect, become today's standard for luxury living: "Absolutely everything unpleasant has been
eliminated."
The 20th-Century Ideal
Since Biltmore's time, a new era has dawned: In the 20th century, most in-home luxuries quickly have
become everyday conveniences for the masses.
Not until 1913 was the first residential air-conditioning system installed: Industrialist Charles Gates (no
relation to Bill) had it put in his Minneapolis mansion. Unfortunately, he died before he ever used it, and air
conditioning in homes didn't really take off until the 1950s. Today, though, this once unheard-of luxury is an
affordable amenity in much of the developed world.
Ditto for a whole array of creature comforts. Electric vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines,
clothes dryers, dishwashers, color television -- all dream products just a few generations ago -- have become
inexpensive and democratized, thanks to improved technology and mass production.
For the first decade or so after color television was introduced in the 1950s, only the well-to-do had the
pocket money to splurge on such an extravagance. Nowadays, even many households of modest means own
several. Much the same goes for personal computers -- except that the time from when they were introduced
to when they became commonplace in homes narrowed to a mere decade. Whirlpool baths, invented by Roy
Jacuzzi in 1968, were rarely found anywhere but millionaires' mansions as recently as the late 1980s; now
they're upgrades in tract houses.
Indeed, the proliferation of luxury products has blurred class barriers. "Whatever other problems we now
have, one of the saving graces has been the elimination of profound differences between the rich and the
poor," writes Ruth Schwartz Cowan, author of "More Work for Mother."
So, what does it take now to have a luxury home the rest of us can only dream about? Well, how about a
5,000-square-foot glass orchid conservatory, like the one former Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. Chairman Michael S.
Egan installed off the master bedroom of his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home? Or maybe a screening room,
manmade lake and boathouse, as in the Miami mansion renovated by movie star Sylvester Stallone? And
then there's the main pad of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, a palace with 1,788 rooms
(including a banquet room that seats 500), a garage for 150 Rolls-Royces and air-conditioned stalls for 200
ponies.
But for the very latest, 21st-century features, even these mansions pale in comparison with the $53.4 million
underground home built by -- who else? -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in Redmond, Wash. His
estate has all the standard luxuries, as it were, including a theater, a big pool, a trampoline room, an arcade
and a dock for water skiing. But thanks to dozens of powerful PCs, it's also programmed to please: Residents
or guests can wear special lapel pins, encoded with their particular tastes, that change the electronic artwork
"hanging" on walls, control the music and adjust the temperature and lighting to their tastes as they move
from room to room.

It was the 1500s, and ruffs were all the rage. Everybody who was anybody just had to have one of the newly
fashionable accordion-style collars in white or yellow, a stylish idea brought back to Europe from India and
popularized in 1540 by the queen of Navarre, who was said to have widened the frill to cover up her ugly
throat.
Of course, to truly stand out, each ruler imparted his or her taste. Queen Elizabeth I preferred the fanciest
lace ruffs, while Henry II went for the gusto -- a collar made of 18 yards of starched, pleated linen that was
measured nearly a foot deep from the chin. The ruff was said to have led to many a chafed neck as well as
"the invention of a long handled spoon, to help food reach people's mouths over these huge collars," wrote
Lynn Schurnberger in her 1991 book "Let There Be Clothes."
The span of a thousand years has produced some truly dreadful stuff in the realm of high fashion -- like the
farthingale, popularized by Princess Juana of Portugal in 1470, which was a wide-hipped skirt stiffened by
whale bone that forced women to walk sideways through doorways. Or the powdered wig, introduced by the
balding Louis XIII of France. The ruff itself had a run of more than 100 years before fading into oblivion.
But the most significant trends in fashion over the past thousand years aren't in the styles that have come and
gone and come back again. Rather, the biggest change is the democratization of fashion. Thanks to mass
production, mass media and mass marketing, the heights of fashion are attainable and affordable to the
masses.
Indeed, as the millennium winds to a close, more and more it's the consumers, not the fashion and retail
industries, who are defining the styles that succeed. Fed up with a breakneck, industry-driven fashion cycle
that renders clothes obsolete from season to season, many people have come to embrace a few basic,
durable, classless and often androgynous styles that work for everyone, like the knit shirts, jeans and blazers
that many now wear in the office and on the weekends. The rich and the poor may still choose different
brands and different stores, but they're often dressing pretty much the same.
In a way, it's a retro look. For hundreds of years, clothing was functional and largely unadorned for the great
majority of people. In the early Middle Ages, it was the unpretentious tunic that suited all -- feudal landlords
and serfs, men and women alike. Back then, people in Europe spent most of their lives in some type of loose
tunic, usually made of rough wool or flax, on which they layered robes and hooded cloaks, topped in the
winter with sheepskins worn skin side to the body.
Starting in 1095, during the Crusades, adventuring warriors returned to Europe with a new knowledge of
foreign cultures -- and a yen for luxury merchandise. The Italian maritime trade was in full swing in 1270 when
Marco Polo accompanied his father, Niccolo, to China, and wrote about the booty of spices, jewels, silks and
embroideries from such expeditions.
A new class of merchants and tailors emerged in bustling metropolises such as London, Munich, Genoa,
Florence, Lyon and Paris. Buttons were invented around 1200 -- not as fasteners, but merely as decoration,
embellishing hemlines, collars and the sides of sleeves. And so began the ritual of fashion, a system of
dressing that took into account prescribed formalities, dress codes and status symbols.
In the late Middle Ages, the rise of capitalism and cities began to blur those strict codes, allowing wealthy
merchants to dress more like the kings. But the royal classes, in conjunction with the church, quickly stepped
in by imposing sumptuary laws to keep the classes distinct. The laws, enacted in the 13th century in
Germany, Italy, England and towns along the Mediterranean, dictated what each class was permitted to wear,
from the height of a hat to the length of the train on a woman's dress. The elite were granted the exclusive
right to wear the richest, darkest colors, like purple, dark green, black and scarlet -- made from an expensive

dye extracted from an insect -- as well as furs like sable and ermine used for lavish trimming on robes.
Artisans and peasants had to settle for plain clothes made with cheap dyes that faded with age.
The sumptuary laws also hemmed in the well-to-do. Rulers knew that too much ostentation could promote
social disorder, so the rich were warned to restrict their consumption of apparel embroidered with golden
threads.
In the 17th century, the European royal classes looked to Parisian monarchs as the arbiters of high style and
taste. They wore big hair -- like the powdered wigs introduced by Louis XIII -- and high heels, such as those
worn by the diminutive Louis XIV, who wanted to appear taller inside his beloved Versailles, the grandest
party palace in all of Europe.
Paris would continue to be fashion's center stage right up to the modern era of haute couture, which was
begun in 1858 by Charles Frederick Worth, an English tailor in Paris. Worth was hired by Napoleon III to
create a suitable wardrobe for his wife, Princess Eugenie, who would become the world's first fashion model.
The king's goal was crudely commercial: that Eugenie's magnificent wardrobe would trigger demand for
French silks and finery that were exported throughout Europe. Before long, fashion would become France's
second-largest export, employing thousands and setting the standard of quality and style for the world.
Perhaps the most beloved of French couturiers was Coco Chanel, who began as a milliner around 1910.
Among her many practical innovations were loose jersey sportswear, the "little black dress" and -- finally --
pants, popularizing the masculine style for which American suffragette Amelia Bloomer had been ridiculed
when she introduced her baggy cycling trousers in the 1850s.
While designers were thinking up new shapes and styles, technological advances in mechanized looms and
the invention of the spinning wheel and cotton gin began to give clothes more variety and texture. The
invention of synthetic aniline dyes, moreover, made colorful clothing available to all. Technology would also
make shoes more comfortable: By 1865, "straights" that fit on either foot were replaced by separate
machine-crafted left and right shoes.
In the 20th century, the fashion revolution speeded up in America, coinciding with the blossoming of the great
marble palaces, department stores like A.T. Stewart in New York, Marshall Field & Co. in Chicago and John
Wanamaker in Philadelphia. The advent of photography and style magazines at the turn of the century led to
the widespread imitation in fashion among all classes. "The whole way of dressing yourself went from a
private experience to a public experience," says Caroline Rennolds Milbank, a fashion historian.
At the same time, the industrial revolution fueled the need for rugged work wear. And along with it came
America's biggest contribution to fashion, from a young California entrepreneur named Levi Strauss, who first
introduced gold miners to his indigo denim work pants in the 1850s. More than a century later, in 1977,
Calvin Klein would elevate blue jeans to a fashion sensation by stitching his name on the back pockets.
Wars have also transformed the apparel industry. America's first Singer sewing machines arrived on the
market several years before the start of the American Civil War, just in time to be put to use in the making of
uniforms for millions of troops. "The greatest innovations that came from military uniforms were in sportswear,
and the sizing of clothing," says Peter Dervis, a specialist in military uniforms. Styles such as trench coats,
aviator jackets, khaki pants and brass buttons all originated in the military, which also fostered the styles of
uniforms worn by doormen, bellhops and waiters.
Two of America's oldest haberdasheries were key suppliers to the military since the 19th century: Brooks
Brothers (founded in 1818) and Hart Schaffner & Marx (founded in 1887 and now called Hartmarx). The
best-dressed army and naval officers bought custom-made uniforms from both retailers, which heavily
courted their business. Brooks Brothers -- whose wartime record stretched back to the Civil War -- ran
newspaper ads to promote its field boots, hats and trench coats as the ideal Christmas gifts for active
servicemen during the first and second world wars. When servicemen went abroad in the 1940s, many wore
pants with a zip-up fly -- a 1936 Hart Schaffner innovation.
While the French couture houses were closed during World War II, Yankee ingenuity finally kicked in with
high-fashion designers like Claire McCardell and Norman Norell, and retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue
developed their own in-house designers. Even though American retailers returned abroad in the 1950s for
knockoffs of Paris couture, "Paris dresses were rarely copied faithfully," wrote Ms. Milbank in her book "New
York Fashion" in 1989. "Instead they served as departure points to American seamstresses" and
manufacturers. French styles had to be adapted to accommodate American women who had begun "to
establish a preference for simpler clothes, like shorter skirts for walking," cycling and other sports, noted Ms.
Milbank. "The most important category of fashion and the one unique to America was that of sportswear."
As a new group of manufacturers centered in New York's garment district came out with innovative fabrics,
including synthetics and knits, American fashion was well on its way to becoming an even bigger force,

thanks to the world-wide appeal of American music and pop culture, which fueled the demand for jeans and
T-shirts.
In the 1990s, however, the fast-moving retail cycle slowed in terms of new styles. Casual attire -- jeans or
khakis and athletic shoes -- has spread as an everyday wardrobe, making people nearly indistinguishable by
class. At the end of the second millennium, fashion has apparently returned to its roots in basic and functional
styles.
But apparel makers, designers and retailers still have a huge financial stake in persuading consumers to
believe in the importance of fashion. So they spend millions of dollars on brand marketing to give their clothes
an image that goes beyond colors and fabrics.
"The paradox is that we are ending up [the millennium] with uniformity, in a way, where one small difference
makes the difference between the Gucci top and the one from Banana Republic," says Richard Martin,
curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. "But the marketing has
created these great identities that people identify with.
"There is always going to be class difference in clothing," he adds, "yet not the old signs of class."

The Millennium --- Finance & Companies: Trading Places --- Stock markets may look nothing like they

It was the hottest IPO of its day. In 1553, The Mysterie and Compagnie of the Merchant Adventurers for the
Discoverie of Regions, Dominions, Islands and Places Unknown offered stock to finance a quest for a
passage to the riches of the East. The shares were quickly snapped up by a select circle of London
merchants.
The venture proved costly for explorer Sir Hugh Willoughby: He and the crews of two ships perished after
being trapped in Arctic ice. But the third vessel's crew reached the court of Ivan the Terrible in Moscow and
returned home with news of Russia's wealth, as well as a treaty giving England freedom to trade there. The
original investors soon reaped rich rewards.
For centuries -- from the time of the merchant adventurer through that of the robber baron and into today's
era of the computer whiz -- financial markets have greased the wheels of commerce. The Muscovy Company,
as the Russian venture became known, wasn't the first to issue shares. But its success spawned other
large-scale joint-stock companies seeking money for similar ventures, which in turn created a need for an
easy way for companies to find wealthy investors, rather than relying on relatives and friends.
The solution: a location where investors could buy and sell shares. In other words, a stock market. "Once you
had stock exchanges, you had a very efficient way of raising capital and investing," says Ruben Lee, director
of Oxford Finance Group in Norwich, England, and author of a book on stock markets. "All of a sudden, you
had a central market where you could go knowing that there would be other people there interested in buying
the same piece of paper you wanted to sell."
Trading was nothing new: Ownership shares in French textile mills had been bought and sold as far back as
the 1100s, and the Bank of Venice had issued the first government bonds in 1157. But it
wasn't until the 16th century that stock exchanges were established. The first was in 1531 in Antwerp,
Belgium -- then a major shipping and trading center -- where brokers gathered to trade shares and
commodities. Hamburg, Germany, also a hub of European trade and home to many powerful merchants, set
up its exchange in 1558. Amsterdam followed, opening an exchange in 1619, ahead of London and Paris,
which opened theirs in the late 1600s. In 1792 the New York Stock Exchange, now far and away the world's
largest in trading volume, got its start. Refinancing of government debt into tradable bonds, together with a
stock issue by the Bank of the United States, had fueled rapid growth in the buying and selling of securities.
As a result, 24 brokers who did business from coffee shops up and down Wall Street signed an agreement
founding the exchange.
Today, there are some 120 stock markets around the globe, as exchanges have sprung up in such far-flung
places as Trinidad and Tobago (whose stock market was founded in 1981), Mauritius (1987), Macedonia
(1996) and Kazakstan (1997).
Stock markets, of course, are far more sophisticated than they were hundreds of years ago. In their early
days, they were little more than a common place -- in London, a coffeehouse; in Amsterdam, the nave of a
church -- where a select group of people could meet to trade stocks in local companies.
Only in the past century did exchanges begin disseminating selected price data on a wider range of
companies to a wider range of people. Most trading was still executed on a trading floor, but today there's
less and less need for that. Instead, exchange members have access to data on stock prices and order sizes
stored on computers, and can buy and sell shares in companies around the globe on a "virtual" exchange.
The founding fathers of Amsterdam's exchange wouldn't recognize the world their descendants deal in. The
Amsterdam market occupies an airy atrium inside a turn-of-the-century building. No paper litters the carpeted
floors. The only signs this might be a stock exchange are in the back of the room, where two electronic

display boards track movements in major markets. While a brass gong is still rung daily to mark the beginning
and end of the trading day, trading itself takes places through the computers of banks and brokers scattered
throughout Europe's financial centers.
"It took 500 years or more from the time trading started until we had stock markets at all," says Frank
Gerstenschlager, a member of the executive board at Deutsche Borse Systems in Frankfurt, Germany. "Now
technology changes so rapidly that we can have complete revolutions in trading in only a few years."
But if the scale, scope and technology of stock markets has changed dramatically, the fundamentals of their
business -- bringing together sellers and buyers -- have changed very little.
Stock markets began as extensions of markets for other types of goods. For ages, merchants have gathered
periodically at central locations to trade wares. As economies grew, so did the range of products on offer. In
the city-states of medieval Italy, commodity markets in metals, textiles and all kinds of agricultural products
flourished. So did trading in instruments of credit, with buyers betting not just on current but prospective
values.
A bank that was owed either money or goods by a merchant could accept a piece of paper in lieu of the
repayment, and then sell or transfer it to other institutions or individuals. In the 1400s, most securities were
tied to government debt (usually sold to finance wars) or commodities. By 1521, formal commodity-trading
markets were established in Antwerp and Amsterdam.
Still, what capitalists needed most was capital to start and run their businesses, and stock exchanges
facilitated a remarkable acceleration in economic growth. They made assets far more liquid, thus enabling
large amounts of money to flow quickly to new business opportunities. At the same time, they allowed newly
wealthy merchants to diversify their holdings and investors to own a stake in a business without having to
involve themselves in running it.
Initially, most stock was issued by a handful of trading companies. Amsterdam's first widely owned company
-- and for centuries, its largest -- was the Dutch East India Co., which dates back to 1599. After driving the
Portuguese out of Indonesia, Dutch merchants set up trading posts throughout the Moluccas -- then known
as the Spice Islands -- and financed expeditions by selling shares. Eventually, even housekeepers dabbled in
the stock, anxiously awaiting news of cargoes of Ming porcelain, indigo, cloves, lacquerware, silk and
precious stones. Feverish trading took place on rumors of shipwrecks or sightings of the returning fleet.
Investment returns could average 20% annually -- a great inducement at a time when interest rates ranged
from 5% to 10%.
By the 18th century, banks and mines, as well as transportation companies that built toll canals and toll
highways, were selling stock. By the 19th century, exchanges became the engine of growth for new ventures
that needed huge amounts of capital: railroads, steamship companies, steelmakers and other industrial
concerns.
Not that the evolution was always smooth. Along the way, exchanges helped to finance such empty ventures
as companies that promised to develop perpetual-motion machines. A treatise in Amsterdam offered a
cautionary guide to the "gambling hell" of the exchange. "Take every gain without showing remorse about
missed profits, because an eel may escape sooner than you think," cautioned Joseph de la Vega, author of
"Confusion de Confusiones," published in 1688. "These stock-exchange people are quite silly, full of
instability, insanity, pride and foolishness. They will sell without knowing the motive; they will buy without
reason."
These words were penned in the aftermath of "Tulipmania," the first of many speculative bubbles that beset
exchanges in Europe and later in the Americas and Asia. Although tulip "shares" weren't listed on the stock
market, traders had used the facilities of the exchange to buy and sell exotic tulip bulbs. By 1636, driven by
surging demand, prices of some rare bulbs were doubling weekly, or even daily. Prices reached such heights
that people were buying not a whole bulb but shares in a bulb; a single bulb might be traded for a collection of
goods headed by a house and land and including a carriage with horses. But in early 1637, some worried
investors pulled out of the market, triggering a crash.
Similarly, the South Sea Bubble bankrupted thousands in London. South Sea Co. had been granted a trading
monopoly with South America and the Pacific. From January to August 1720, speculators bid up shares
nearly tenfold. But many investors, including Britain's king and prime minister, put down as little as 10% to
buy their shares, which proved worthless when many realized the company's prospects were hyped.
Leverage also was a culprit in the 1929 stock-market crash in New York. Speculators borrowed funds to
invest in the booming market, expecting the return from their stocks to exceed the interest rate on the loan. At
first, this seemed logical: Stock in Radio Corp. of America surged to $420 a share from $85 in 1928 despite
paying no dividends. But when prices began to fall, creditors found themselves dragged under along with
their borrowers.

Market speculation emphasized the importance of timely and accurate information. In 18th-century England,
Sir Harry Furness, a well-known speculator who reportedly had better sources of information than the king,
was rewarded with a diamond ring for whispering the latest market-moving news into the royal ear. Investors
turned to fleets of carrier pigeons or semaphore networks to try to get an edge on their competition.

Corrections & Amplifications
THE FIRST STOCK EXCHANGE was established in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1531, as reported in an article on
stock markets in a special report on the Millennium on Jan. 11. An accompanying timeline incorrectly gave
the year as 1631. Also, an item in the special report on the late economist and Yale University professor
Irving Fisher included a photograph supplied by Culver Pictures that wasn't of the professor.
(WSJ Feb. 9, 1999)
Access to information led, inevitably, to efforts to manipulate markets. English satirist Jonathan Swift, himself
an avid investor, blasted stock traders in a 1719 pamphlet for "coining false news...whispering imaginary
terrors, frights, hopes, expectations." In February 1814, a man claiming to be an aide-de-camp to the armies
fighting Napoleon landed in Dover and claimed that Cossacks had butchered Napoleon at a large battle and
that Paris had fallen. He distributed the "news" on his coach trip to London. Stock prices soared, and he and
fellow conspirators sold shares, capturing a 15% profit before the fraud was unmasked.
But the bubbles and market manipulation -- and the economic damage they left in their wake -- didn't prevent
stock exchanges from growing. "What happened after each speculative attack on the market is that the
infrastructure of an exchange, its regulation, became much bigger and more effective," says Cherelt Kroeze,
manager of the archives at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
By the late 19th century, rapid technological advances had already improved communications and were
beginning to dramatically alter the way in which stocks were traded. In 1867, the New York Stock Exchange
introduced its first ticker, quoting stock prices. A transatlantic telegraph cable had been completed the
previous year, allowing traders in New York and London to communicate. Improved communication increased
trading volume: In 1886, the exchange had its first million-share day; 25 years earlier, the average daily
volume had been only about 1,500 shares.
In the 20th century, a continuing surge in volume has required exchanges to embrace ever more
sophisticated technology to keep running efficiently. Even on a hectic day in Frankfurt -- the world's
fifth-largest stock market -- the exchange's floor shows no sign of a trading frenzy, because more than 80% of
Frankfurt's trading takes place on a computer screen.
The New York Stock Exchange is one of few exchanges that still cling to the tradition of floor trading.
Computers have crept in everywhere, of course -- they distribute prices to traders, while specialists tap orders
into an electronic trading book. But at the end of an average day, after 650 million shares have changed
hands, exhausted traders still leave behind a floor ankle-deep in paper.
Indeed, NYSE trading still has much in common with 17th-century trading in Amsterdam: Mr. de la Vega
wrote in his treatise that ritual handshakes confirming trades quickly degenerated into a manic display of
hand slapping "followed by shouting, insults, impudence, pushing and shoving."
But this remaining link with the past may be doomed on the venerable Big Board, too. Some pundits believe
that stock exchanges, at least as they have existed for nearly 500 years, may be headed for obsolescence.
"There's no longer any logic to the way exchanges are structured today," argues Benn Steil, director of the
international- economics program and the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
Stock markets were created as places where stockbrokers and traders could gather to conduct business. But
what if another place -- cyberspace, in the form of increasingly sophisticated computer trading systems --
proves more efficient than a physical location? Investors of all sizes and, eventually, from all parts of the
world would be able to "meet" directly via computer. Companies wanting to raise money by offering stocks or
bonds could link up with them directly, too.
If exchanges were to evolve into virtual markets that exist only electronically -- overseen by a small coterie of
executives and computer wizzes -- the intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of shareholders would
probably become redundant.
Ways would have to be found, of course, to regulate such a global cyber-market. If an investor in Malaysia
can use a direct-access, computerized trading system to trade stocks in New York or London, could
securities regulators establish jurisdiction to guard against manipulation and other types of fraud?

Still, the economics of new-age stock markets are compelling -- just as they were back in the 1500s when
companies and investors needed a more efficient method. Electronic trading systems accessible to
institutional investors already charge commissions as low as a cent a share, compared with about six cents
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. "Maybe the exchanges of the future will just be trading
systems," says Mr. Steil. "There won't be any members, just clients on each side of the transaction."

Kazakstan Weathers Worst of Turmoil---Outlook Is Bright Despite a Marred Presidential Vote

Kazakstan Weathers Worst of Turmoil --- Outlook Is Bright Despite a Marred Presidential Vote

ALMATY, Kazakstan -- The key Central Asian state of Kazakstan has weathered the worst of the global
financial crisis, and international bankers think this Western Europe-sized country will keep plugging ahead,
despite charges of a rigged presidential election due on Sunday.
Low world prices for oil, copper, gold and other commodities produced by Kazakstan mean that 1999 will be
a hard year for this former Soviet republic of 16 million people, many of whom are eking out subsistence-level
livings through the snow-bound winter on the steppe. Indeed, unusually bountiful supplies of heating gas,
pumped up to please voters ahead of the election, may be cut once the vote is over. But bankers believe that
the national currency, the tenge, will hold steady after the poll, in spite of popular fears of a post-election
collapse.
"I think the tenge will stay exactly where it is," says Otbert de Jong, General Manager of ABN-Amro Bank
Kazakhstan. He notes that the Kazak Central Bank's reserves are healthy, international lines of credit are
available and top Kazak bureaucrats are taking a sound, firm line on the country's finances. "I see no severe
difficulties on the macro side, unless the oil market gets completely shot. Kazakstan can sustain this for a
couple of years."
But President Nursultan Nazarbayev, a 58-year-old former metal worker who has led Kazakstan since Soviet
times, is trying to run his domestic politics as tightly as his public finances. Sunday's election of a president
for a seven-year term is tinged with repression. Two significant challengers have been disqualified. Of the
three remaining candidates, one heads the rump of the unpopular communist party, the second is declining to
campaign for lack of funds and the third appears to have been tapped for comic relief.
During one clumsily staged interview on Kazak state television, challenger Gany Kasimov, head of the Kazak
customs agency, seized a wine glass and crushed it in his bare hand until he bled. In another, he threw a
vase of flowers in the direction of his interviewer. People with business at the customs agency quote officials
as saying their boss will be back from his "holiday" next week.
Western nations object to this treatment of the democratic values they hope to foster in Central Asia. The
U.S. is upset because one of the Kazak employees of its Almaty embassy, who monitors the activities of the
opposition, was badly beaten in the head by three attackers who stole his briefcase -- but not his wallet -- on
Dec. 22.
"It's not surprising that they are focused on remaining in power. What's galling is that they say they want to be
democratic. Our expectations for Kazakstan were higher than this, and it hurts the investment climate," says
one Western diplomat, who also complains that corruption is rife in the upper reaches of the Kazak
government.
More charitably, Central Asia expert Shirin Akiner says the Kazak government believes its Western partners
actually only want democratic window dressing during the country's stressful period of transformation from 70
years of Soviet rule. Indeed, officials from companies like Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp., which control
Kazakstan's huge Tengiz oil field, make little secret of their backing for the continuity represented by Mr.
Nazarbayev.
"For the whole economy of Kazakstan, having a president like that is not a bad thing. He's done well over the
past few years," says ABN-Amro's Mr. de Jong, who notes that there were no debt defaults by banks or the
Kazak state last year, despite such problems as the worst grain harvest in three decades. "If you have to
have a consensus government, you'll have a lot of fighting in parliament, and the reform process would
suffer."

A tight grip may also make the country easier to govern in a year during which most analysts predict the
economy won't grow: Worst-case scenarios see a contraction of 5%. Luckily for Mr. Nazarbayev, workers
have only occasionally protested ruthless spending cuts that held inflation in 1998 to just 1.9%. Bankers
expect inflation to remain in single digits in 1999.
Other successes include the fledgling stock market, where trading volumes are rising. Final agreements have
been reached to start building the big Caspian Pipeline Consortium oil-export line from the Tengiz field. And a
new generation of private pension funds in 1998 got off to a spectacular start, with an average real return of
24%, says Grigory Marchenko, president of DB Securities (Kazakstan), a unit of Deutsche Bank.
Mr. Marchenko, a former senior securities official, says the shock of the 1998 global crisis may also force
conservative officials to rethink their opposition to privatization. He also believes there could be stronger
support for a relaunch of the sell-off program recently proposed by Mr. Nazarbayev. "They still have many
assets to sell, like the mines," he says.

Latin American stock markets stumbled from the outset of 1998 and never managed to regain their footing.
The region's major indexes closed the year with losses ranging from 20% to 50%.
Canadian shares were led lower by the country's resource sector.
In Latin America, stocks from the stronger economies of Mexico and Argentina suffered alongside those from
weaker countries such as Venezuela and Brazil.
Latin stocks were largely a victim of neglect by foreign investors, whose massive inflows had helped fuel
rallies in years past but slowed to a dribble in 1998. In the wake of huge losses from Asian and Russian
shares, many simply lost their taste for all emerging markets -- and were reluctant to bet on Latin stocks at
any price.
Commodity exports proved to be an Achilles' heel for Latin stocks. Thanks in part to depressed demand from
Asia, the prices of oil, steel, copper, and paper and pulp all sank in 1998, forcing governments to slash
spending and cutting into corporate profits. With sharply lower revenues from commodity exports, the balance
of trade worsened in many countries, setting off new concerns about economic stability and giving investors
another reason to flee Latin shares.
Higher interest rates across the region put another choke-hold on economic expansion. Though rates have
inched down in recent weeks, higher borrowing costs already have taken their toll on growth. Merrill Lynch
expects regional GDP to have expanded by 2.3% in 1998 -- less than half of the 5.4% regional growth in
1997. Final 1998 growth figures aren't yet available. This year could be worse: Merrill Lynch forecasts 1.1%
GDP growth in 1999, with Brazil's economy actually shrinking by 1.5%.
Here is a look at some individual markets:
Argentina
Argentina's stock market finished the year down 37.5% in dollar terms in 1998.
In a year of currency troubles world-wide, Argentina's dollar remained solid. Nevertheless, the stock market
bore the brunt of speculation that Argentina's currency system would snap like a matchstick in the face of a
Brazilian devaluation. In addition, rising interest rates resulting from financial-market stress hurt bank stocks,
and low commodity prices dimmed the outlook for oil-related shares.
Brazil
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index closed the year down 38.6%.
The sharpest price declines were triggered by the collapse of the Russian ruble in late summer. Fearing
Brazil's currency could be the next to fall, and seeking to cash out of all emerging markets, investors dumped
Brazilian shares and rushed to convert their Brazilian reals to U.S. dollars.
Bleeding foreign reserves in an effort to defend the currency, Brazil's government took the drastic step of
raising domestic interest rates to nearly 50%, choosing the likelihood of a recession over the prospect of a
currency devaluation. The mood soared as the International Monetary Fund and others then stepped in with
the promise of $41.5 billion in backup foreign reserves.
Canada

For the second year in a row, the anemic resource sector held back Canadian stock markets. In 1997, the
Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock index didn't rise as much as the U.S. market, but it did rise. But in 1998,
the TSE 300 headed south by 3.2%, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock average gained 26.7%.
A slump in demand from the battered Asian economies sent world commodity prices lower, and that slammed
Canadian base metal, gold, energy and forest-product stocks. Stock prices of companies with interests in
these resources, taken in the aggregate, account for about 20% of the TSE 300, compared with 8% of the
S&P 500, so their impact is more acute. Among the bright spots: consumer products, utilities,
communications and media stocks.
Chile
Battered by weak copper prices and recessions in Asian economies, Chilean stocks finished the year down
28.1%.
Even though Chile has been hailed as a Latin American model for its economic reforms, the country's
fortunes remain perilously linked to prices of commodities such as fish meal, wood pulp and copper. Weak
Asian demand helped lower prices of these basic goods, leaving Chile with a growing trade imbalance.
Mexico
In 1998, Mexico's Bolsa de Valores was brutally reminded of its Wall Street asset class: emerging markets.
Despite the third straight year of economic growth, and individual companies posting some of their best
operating results in a decade, foreign investors fled. The result was a bolsa falling almost 40% in dollar terms.
Mexico's bellwether Indice de Precios y Cotizaciones, or IPC, closed at 3959.6, down 38.5% from 1997, but
thanks to a late-year recovery, a 33% rise from the bottom in late summer. In June, Mexico's IPC index fell
below its level of March 1995, when Mexico was mired in its worst recession in 60 years.
Of Mexico's 80 most liquid stocks, including dozens trading in the U.S. as American depositary shares, all but
one closed lower in 1998 than the previous year. The year's best performer was agribusiness conglomerate
Empresas la Moderna, whose New York Stock Exchange-listed shares finished up 8.9%.
Venezuela
Foreign investors pounded Venezuelan shares this year -- pushing the IBC index down 50.6% over 12
months.
Sagging oil prices were a prime concern -- since they make up about 70% of government revenues. Investors
also had most of the year to worry about the possibility of an opposition victory in the country's presidential
elections, which took place in early December. Hugo Chavez's victory in that race actually proved to be a
boon for stocks.

EUROPE/AFRICA/MIDEAST
Nigeria Scraps
Its Dual System
On Exchange Rates
In a move certain to please the International Monetary Fund, Nigeria scrapped its dual exchange-rate system,
an arrangement that allowed official transactions to be conducted at rates far more advantageous than the
value of the nation's currency in the free market. While the decision taken late last week is unlikely to please
some in the top ranks of the armed forces who have been among the beneficiaries of such practices, it's seen
as one more indication that reforms are beginning to happen in Africa's most populous nation. With free
elections set for next month, Nigeria's military ruler, Abdulsalami Abubakar, is also taking a rather pragmatic
view of the budget, warning that the big drop in the price of oil -- by far the economy's most vital resource --
will put serious strains on government spending and continue to undermine the nation's overall economic
performance.
The troubles on the oil front have been so bad that Nigeria is now adopting a price of just $9 a barrel when
calculating revenue from oil sales for its budget. That's a far cry from as much as $17 a barrel at the
beginning of last year. Meanwhile, Nigeria is sending out word that annual repayments on its external debt
will be cut by a quarter to $1.5 billion. At the same time, however, it said it will step up efforts to negotiate
relief on its $35 billion external debt with the IMF, the World Bank and other creditors.
Kremlin Details Currency's Steep Slide
The extent of the damage from tumbling oil prices is evident in Russia as well. Caught in its worst economic
slide in years, the Kremlin announced that the ruble had lost an astounding 70% of its value against the dollar
in the four months since the devaluation of the currency sparked a financial crisis last August. To make
matters worse, it said inflation, which appeared to be under control a mere six months ago, reached a rate of
84.4% last year. While lower oil prices are contributing to overall economic hardship given that Russia is a
major oil exporter, the country has been hit hard as well by the Asian crisis and the chronic inability of
successive governments to finance expenditures. For all of last year, economic output shrank 5%, while
industrial production was off 5.5%.
Russian Water Bill Sparks Dispute
In a billing dispute that may spark an international incident, officials in the Estonian city of Narva turned off the
water to a Russian border town that is behind paying its water bill to the tune of $1 million. And in what may
be an even bigger problem, it refused to treat the town's sewage. Ivangorod's mayor said his community may
have to dump its waste each day into the Narva River, which flows into the Gulf of Finland, if Narva holds
steadfast in its position. Ivangorod has long been unable to pay Narva, and the problem has only worsened
since Russia's financial crisis hit in August. Though Ivangorod gets only a quarter of its water supply from
Narva and is managing to find some other water sources in the meantime, it reportedly doesn't have the
money to build its own sewage-treatment plant.
Israel Sees Drop in Diamond Exports
Israel saw exports of its polished diamonds slide 11% to $3.6 billion last year as the crisis in Southeast Asia
continued to take its toll on the industry. In all, Southeast Asian countries bought just 19% of all Israeli exports
of the gems in 1998, down from 31% a year earlier. But that sharp fall was cushioned somewhat by growing
sales in the U.S. -- the sector's biggest market. Last year, U.S. buyers -- boosted by good times at home --

purchased 61% of the Mideast nation's polished diamond exports. That's up from 50% in 1997 and 44% in
1996. Meanwhile, European imports remained steady at 16%.
BRIEFLY:
-- An IMF delegation is set to visit Russia later this month to discuss the next tranche of a $22.6 billion loan
package. The IMF disbursed only a fifth of the money before putting the deal on hold in August.
-- Poland replaced its communist-era division into 49 regions with 16 larger ones. The move is said to be
more in line with existing administrative regions in countries in the European Union, which Poland is hoping to
join.
-- Meanwhile, Poland's deficit in its current account, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services,
totaled $5.52 billion for the first 11 months of the year. That compares with a deficit of $3.99 billion for the
same period a year earlier.
ASIA/PACIFIC
Vietnam Plans to Cut Phone Rates
Picking up the telephone anywhere in Hanoi and dialing out of the country can be a mighty expensive
proposition. The Southeast Asian nation has some of the highest telephone rates in the world. But that could
change in the not-too-distant future. The government says it will gradually begin to cut rates on international
calls in a move that is expected to also ease the discrepancy between the flood of incoming calls and the
much slower traffic in calls being placed to destinations outside the country. Local news reports say the first
10% reduction in rates could come as early as the middle of this year and that the government's ultimate goal
is to bring phone tariffs down to the level of the U.S. or Canada. Right now it costs $3 a minute to dial up from
Hanoi to Bangkok but only half that much from Bangkok to Hanoi.
China's Capital Controls Under Fire
The red tape may stop some smuggling, but there are those who say China's new capital controls are
choking the country's imports and heightening tensions with its major trading partners. By raising collateral
requirements for bank loans in order to toughen rules for import licenses, Beijing is making it more difficult for
traders to bring goods into the country. Critics say that while these moves may stop some smuggling and
falsifying of trade documents, they also strangle genuine import orders from arriving in shops and factories
across the country. Nevertheless, Chinese officials say the new controls are needed to standardize a porous
import regime, and mark a step forward -- not a step back.
Korea Posts Record Trade Surplus
South Korea posted a record trade surplus of $39.88 billion last year -- a provisional figure that leaves its
previous record of $8.89 billion, posted a decade earlier, in the dust. The chief reason for the
out-of-the-ballpark figure was a plunge in imports linked to sluggish consumption at home as Koreans laid low
in the face of the severe economic crisis rocking the nation. By comparison, in 1997, South Korea reported a
trade deficit of $8.45 billion. The government says it expects its current trade surplus to shrink considerably
this year; it's forecasting a surplus of $25 billion as the economy and domestic consumption begin to recover.
Indonesian Consumer Prices Jump
Inflation is continuing to head higher in Indonesia. An increase in the price of everything from clothing and
cigarettes to housing, transportation and health care pushed consumer prices up 1.42% in December from a
month earlier. That compares with an increase of just 0.08% in November from the previous month. The
December figure represents the continuation of an upward spiral that is expected to see the rate of inflation
in the archipelago reach a staggering 80% for all of last year. On a brighter note, the overall price data were
helped by a drop in the price of gold.
BRIEFLY:
-- Taiwan's cabinet approved a comprehensive package aimed at stimulating the island's depressed property
market and, by extension, future economic growth.
The AMERICAS
Mexican Lawmakers Clear Budget
Mexican lawmakers approved the country's most austere budget in modern times last week, narrowly
averting a constitutional crisis and the prospect of the government grinding to a halt. The budget battle came
down to the wire Thursday as legislators struggled to find ways to make up for tumbling oil prices without

unpopular new taxes, all the while keeping the country's budget deficit from soaring. The lack of a budget
could have paralyzed the government of Latin America's second-largest economy behind Brazil.
Mexico Ends Subsidies on Tortillas
Mexico used to enforce price controls on such items as bread, milk, rice and beans, but gradually lifted them
in recent years as the North American Free Trade Agreement accelerated the liberalization of its economy.
Now the last of the controls on basic foodstuffs is history. The government used the occasion of the new year
to once and for all scrap the decades-old subsidy on tortillas, which are the mainstay of the nation's diet,
along with longtime price controls on the thin corn pancakes. The decision is expected to make life a bit
tougher for the poorest of Mexico's poor, though the government says the move will free up more money for
welfare programs.
BRIEFLY:
-- Unemployment in Colombia surged to 15.7% in December, its highest level in more than 20 years.
-- Ecuador said inflation rose 0.8% in December from November and 43.4% from a year earlier.
-- Meanwhile, Venezuela's consumer prices rose 1.7% in December from the previous month and 29.9% from
a year earlier.
-- Argentina Gold said its board unanimously recommended that shareholders reject Barrick Gold's
previously announced four Canadian dollar (US$2.58) a share takeover offer for all of its outstanding shares.

Last year, even Warren Buffett couldn't save commodities from bear claws.
For most commodity markets in 1998, a slide that began in mid-1997 turned into a trip over the precipice.
One commodity after another fell to historic lows. In most cases, the root cause was the same: shriveling
demand caused by the financial crises in formerly fast-growing Asian countries and elsewhere, coupled with
persistent supply gluts fed by overzealous farmers, oil producers, mining companies and others. "1998 has
been a devastating year for commodities in general," says Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM
Group, a metals consulting firm in New York. "Oil, copper, gold -- you've seen record lows in all of them."
Of course, commodities enjoyed some bright flashes, and their bargain-basement prices attracted at least
one famous buyer. News of Mr. Buffett's late-1997 purchase of 129.7 million ounces of silver broke in early
February, sending the metal's prices briefly above $7 an ounce as copycat traders rushed to follow in the
footsteps of the legendary investor. Other commodity markets managed half-hearted rallies during stocks'
late-summer flirtation with a bear market.
But bullish moves, even the one inspired by Mr. Buffett, proved short-lived. The widely watched Bridge
Commodity Research Bureau Index of spot prices, which reached its 1998 peak during the height of Buffett
mania, slipped 17% from its 1997 finish of 229.14 to 191.22. That was just above its nadir for 1998, the
index's 21-year-low of 188.28 on Dec. 21. The energy-heavy Goldman Sachs Commodity Index of spot prices
also declined, falling 24% from its 1997 finish of 175.623 to end 1998 at 133.02.
For economists worried about inflation, the plight of commodities was good news. But for those fretting about
1998's new bogeyman, a world-wide recession with its roots in Asia, low prices looked more like a dire sign of
deflation. "This whole year has been a continuation of what began originally in Thailand: weakness in various
global economies that resulted in reduced imports {by those countries} of commodities in general," says
Robert Hafer, managing director at Bridge/CRB.
Low oil prices, meanwhile, led to two of the biggest merger announcements in history, as oil firms sought
shelter in each other's arms. British Petroleum Co. agreed to acquire Amoco Corp. early in the year. Then, on
Dec. 1, Exxon Corp. agreed to buy Mobil Corp. in a $75.3 billion deal that reunites two big chunks of the old
Standard Oil trust.
Meanwhile, despite raw materials' woes, many of the futures exchanges where commodities change hands
enjoyed record trading volumes as market participants, upset by the stock market's dizzying turns and the
Long-Term Capital Management LP debacle in 1998's second half, turned to futures to hedge bets made in
other markets. Such trading records were reported at the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange and elsewhere.
In 1999, commodities investors will look for the low prices to drive commodity producers, ranging from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to individual copper miners and farmers, to cut output to ease
supply gluts. Some observers also expect Asia to begin its long-awaited turnaround, which could lead to
reinvigorated demand by late this year or early 2000. But all agree that commodities have a long climb back.
"If you look at past commodity troughs and rallies, they look similar to this one," says Steve Strongin, head of
futures research at Goldman Sachs in New York. "What makes this one different is the slowness of the
decline, about two years in length. So we're probably looking at a recovery over two years" as well.
Here is a review of major markets:
CRUDE OIL: For black gold, 1998 proved to be the most bearish year since the 1986 oil bust.

--- Page 76 ---

After finishing 1997 at $17.64 a barrel, the nearest-month contract ended 1998 at $12.05 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, above its Dec. 10 closing low for the year, $10.72 a barrel, but still down 32% for
1998. Even the U.S. attack on Iraq didn't resuscitate the price for long, though a year-end cold snap sparked
a modest increase.
Blame El Nino for one of the oil market's problems, the unseasonably warm winter last year in the U.S.
Northeast and Midwest. Blame OPEC for its other major problem; on the heels of an ill-timed decision by the
cartel in late 1997 to raise its production ceiling by 2.5 million barrels to 27.5 million barrels a day, the warm
weather in the U.S. swelled stockpiles of crude and its products, heating oil and gasoline. And as prices
slipped below $15 a barrel in March 1998, oil companies, including Unocal Corp., began reining in their
capital spending plans.
In late March, OPEC came to the rescue with the first of its production-cut pledges, sending oil prices briefly
above $16 a barrel. But the skeptical market soon slipped once more, falling in June to what were 12-year
lows, below $12 a barrel. That prompted OPEC to ally with certain large non-OPEC producing countries,
notably Mexico, to again cut production later that month, sending oil futures back up to around $15 a barrel.
But members of the cartel didn't all adhere to their production-cut promises of 2.6 million barrels a day. Even
belligerence in Iraq in late October and again in December didn't lead to any lasting rally. For most of the
year, Iraq's exports of crude under a deal with the United Nations exacerbated the oversupply problem. After
a few months of trading in the range of $15 a barrel in the fall, crude in early November began its steady
descent back to $10.72 a barrel, its most recent 12-year closing low. Prices, adjusted for inflation, haven't
been so low since the early 1970s.
The supply glut, meanwhile, hasn't gone away. Nizam Sharief, an oil analyst with Hornsby & Co. in Houston,
puts world crude supply at one million barrels a day above world demand. He expects that surplus to narrow
to a 300,000 barrel a day this year.
The good news for consumers is that prices for heating oil and gasoline are at historic lows, with gas prices at
the pump at their lowest inflation-adjusted levels since record-keeping began in 1919. Suffering from their
own oversupply problems, oil-product prices paralleled crude's fall in 1998. The front-month heating-oil
contract at the Nymex ended the year at 34 cents a gallon , down 31% from its 1997 finish, while the
front-month gasoline finished at 35.7 cents a gallon, down 32%.
This year, oil traders and analysts likely will look to OPEC, and non-OPEC nations such as Mexico, to initiate
further production cuts. Without real and lasting cuts, the oversupply problem threatens to weigh on prices for
a long time.
PRECIOUS METALS: For silver investors, 1998 was the year that came in like a bull and went out like a
bear. The bullish influence of Mr. Buffett sent prices to 9u-year highs above $7 a troy ounce in early February
and kept interest in the metal relatively strong through May. But prices gradually waned as the year went on.
Market fundamentals, the negative influence of lackluster gold prices and poor world economic conditions
eroded most of silver's gains over the second half of the year.
Mr. Buffett hasn't made any announcements about his silver position since February. The near-month silver
futures contract ended 1998 at $5.02 an ounce on the Nymex's Comex division, down 16% and just above
pre-Buffett 1997 lows.
Gold continued 1997's long trip down as speculators turned negative, central banks continued to sell chunks
of their reserves, and U.S. investors lost interest. The nearest-month contract touched a historic low in
January and again in late August, when it dipped as low as $271.60 a troy ounce.
In the last couple of months of 1998, gold traded in a range between $285 and $300 an ounce while traders
looked in vain for a reason to send the price higher or lower. The nearest-month contract ended the year at
$289.20 an ounce at the Comex, about flat with its 1997 finish.
The lackluster price movement in gold baffled some analysts. "Even though there was relatively strong
jewelry and investment demand" in some regions of the world, such as India, "the price didn't rise," CPM
Group's Mr. Christian says. He believes short-term proprietary trading strategies countered favorable
supply/demand dynamics and kept prices low.
But the fundamental factors in the gold market weren't all favorable either. The Asian crisis played a role in
gold's doldrums. Gold prices for part of the summer mirrored the Japanese yen's movements against the
U.S. dollar, a ratio that traders took as a proxy for Asian buying power. That didn't make for favorable price
moves.

Gold's prospects in 1999 remain bearish. Central banks aren't likely to stop selling and lending gold,
according to Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. in London. The lease
rates they receive for the metal, though low, are "better than nothing," Mr. Klapwijk adds.
Ever-volatile platinum prices, meanwhile, swung back and forth throughout 1998 on uncertainties about
Russian exports. Like gold, platinum reached its 1998 high of $440 an ounce early in the year and ended
much lower, at $364.50 an ounce on the Comex, down 2% from year-end 1997.
BASE METALS: If the Asian crisis knocked down copper in 1997, the resulting supply surplus delivered the
knock-out blow in 1998.
For most of the year, copper prices bounced between 70 cents and 80 cents a pound on the Comex. As it
became clear Asian demand growth for the metal in infrastructure projects wouldn't re-emerge anytime soon,
attention shifted to the supply surplus that some analysts predicted would build. For many months it didn't,
letting the price inch above 80 cents in April and May and again in August.
"Copper has been interesting because for a long time, there was a lot of dispute about where it was heading,"
says Kevin Norrish, minerals economist at Barclays Capital in London. "Analysts were divided into two
camps: those who were expecting a large surplus and those predicting a smaller surplus or even a slight
deficit."
But in early December, as supply began to build in the form of stocks in London Metal Exchange
warehouses, the price finally slipped below the key 70-cents level and kept falling, hitting one historic low
after another. Exchange warehouse stockpiles in mid-December were 200,000 tons higher than year-earlier
levels. The front-month copper contract at the Comex ended at 66.35 cents a pound, down 14% from 1997,
while copper for three-month delivery at the LME finished at around $1,492.50 per metric ton, down more
than $200 a ton.
Analysts estimate 1998's year-end copper surplus was between 300,000 tons and 400,000 tons. Mr. Norrish
says he expects 1999 to end with a surplus as well, unless copper producers begin to shutter mines.
Even with production cuts, recovery could be difficult for copper prices without a rebound on the beleaguered
demand side. Mr. Strongin of Goldman Sachs says that is because metals were the commodity sector hit
hardest by the Asian crisis. "It's a structural issue in that the metals are so dependent on the
capital-investment issue. There's no indication that capital investment in Asia is coming back," he says.
Similar issues weighed on other base-metals markets, most notably aluminum. Like copper, aluminum
finished 1998 with a significant supply surplus. The three-month LME contract ended at around $1,251 a ton,
down about $300 a ton from 1997 levels. Mr. Norrish says aluminum prices could dip as low as $1,100 a
metric ton this year.
AGRICULTURE: For the country's ranchers, 1998 was a year of both feast and famine.
That's because livestock cycles, new breeding techniques and new technology led to record herds of both
cattle and hogs. Cheap feed prices, and in the case of cattle, longer times spent in feedlots, allowed the
animals to fatten to record sizes. But their vast numbers weighed heavily on prices.
In late June, amid cattle prices' steepest declines, cattle were on average 20 pounds heavier than their
year-earlier weights. In July, prices slipped as low as 58 cents a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Feed-yard operators, hoping cash prices would rise, kept their stock on feed longer, exacerbating the
oversupply problem.
Prices, which rallied briefly in the fall, have since fallen back to near lows because, though beef fundamentals
have improved, the meat is competing with abundant supplies of pork and chicken. The front-month live-cattle
future at the CME ended 1998 at 62 cents a pound, down 7% since year end 1997.
For hogs, the glut and resulting price plunge have been even worse. Encouraged by relatively strong prices in
the last few years, hog farmers increased herd sizes. Cash hog prices, which in some parts of the Midwest
fell to seven cents a pound in mid-December, saw their lowest levels since 1941.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recorded week after week of record slaughters, leading the National Pork
Producers Council to ask the government to help ailing hog producers. The front-month futures price, which
early in the year traded in a narrow range around 60 cents a pound, slipped steadily between July and last
month, bottomed out at 21.1 cents a pound and ended 1998 at 32.65 cents a pound, down 43%. A bullish
USDA report lent some last-minute support.

Will the report's optimism hold in 1999? Chuck Levitt, a livestock analyst with Alaron Trading in Chicago, says
prices will rise, but because of the heavy supply gluts, it will take anywhere from a few months to most of the
year.
Meanwhile, the grains markets sank for most of the year . Farmers and traders nurtured bumper crops of
wheat, corn and soybeans at the same time that export demand from Asia dried up and competition from
foreign crops intensified.
The front-month corn contract sank below $2 a bushel for the first time since 1988, ultimately falling to a low
for the year of $1.8975 a bushel before recovering to end down 19% from its 1997 close, at $2.135 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade. The front-month soybean contract dipped to just above $5 a bushel before
recovering to end the year down 20% from 1997 a bushel at $5.3775 a bushel on the CBOT. Wheat prices
also touched their 1998 lows in late August before recovering on news of a food-aid package to Russia.
Front-month wheat prices at the CBOT settled at $2.7625 a bushel, down 15% from their 1997 finish.
Dan Cekander, head of grains research at Fimat in Chicago, said grains prices this year and in 2000 will
depend largely on the stocks of grains and soybeans left at the start of the planting year. He believes corn
prices aren't likely to rise or fall much early this year, while continued low exports and high stockpiles could
weigh on wheat and soybeans prices.
ELECTRICITY: This nascent market, which at the beginning of the year had no futures contracts based on
East Coast or Midwest delivery points, still proved it could pack a powerful punch to corporate bottom lines
when record Midwest temperatures sent over-the-counter prices sky-high in June.
That month, as heat blistered the South, Midwest and Northeast, trading prices for power needed by utilities
in the next hour soared as high as $7,000 a megawatt-hour. Prices again spiked in July, to $2,000 a
megawatt-hour. Among the many results of the so-called short squeeze, which resulted when utilities with
power could name their price to those without it, were lawsuits among utilities and power marketers,
questions about utility deregulation and a months-long virtual halt of trading in the power market.
Craig Poler, vice president of ED&F Man Capital's electricity derivatives brokerage operation in New York,
says electricity trading remains quiet, particularly in over-the-counter trading. "The market still hasn't
recovered," he says.
Of course, traders now have a wide range of exchange-traded futures and options to choose from. Such
products are considered safer than over-the-counter products because they are backed by credit-worthy
clearinghouses. The first of the new products, based on the East Coast, began trading in July, after the initial
power-price spike. Now the Nymex and CBOT both trade contracts based in Eastern and Midwestern
markets. But open interest in them remains relatively small.
TROPICAL COMMODITIES: Prices continued to erode in coffee and cocoa and plunged in sugar in 1998
because of supply surpluses and waning demand from countries hurt by economic crises.
Reports that Brazil, the world's largest coffee-producer, would likely have a bumper crop and reserve a large
chunk of it for exports sent the market down during the first half. Fears that Brazil's precarious economic
position might cause the country to export still more of its crop to earn foreign currency pushed the price still
lower, down toward $1 a pound on the New York Board of Trade's Coffee Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. As
coffee futures sank, major roasters cut retail prices during the summer.
Flood damage in Central America caused by lethal fallout from Hurricane Mitch sent futures briefly higher in
November. But that rally didn't last, and coffee prices since mid-November have remained below $1.20 a
pound, ending the year down 28% at $1.1775 a pound.
Ann Prendergast, a soft-commodities analyst at Refco Inc. in New York, says coffee prices could move a bit
higher this year because the 1999-2000 crop, currently estimated at around 23 million bags, is expected to
come in much smaller than the record 1998-99 crop. She is looking for a price range of between $1.10 and
$1.30 a pound.
Ms. Prendergast is less bullish on cocoa and sugar prices, both of which suffered when the devaluation of the
Russian ruble cut Russian consumers' spending power. With slim prospects for a recovery in Russia, which
accounts for 27% of world demand, and chocolate manufacturers now operating on a just-in-time inventory
basis, Ms. Prendergast says she hasn't ruled out a decline in cocoa prices to $1,350 a ton in 1999.
Russian demand also will play a role in sugar prices this year. The front-month sugar contract fell all year in
1998 as world surpluses grew and demand fell in Asia and Russia. Prices peaked in January above 12 cents
a pound; by September they had nearly halved to 6.60 cents a pound. Since then, sugar prices have
recovered a bit and finished 1998 at 7.86 cents a pound, down 36%, with traders looking to lower Russian
taxes on imports in 1999 to spur the country's sugar demand.

Corrections & Amplifications
THE ESTIMATED TOTAL RETURN for 1998 on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reported in the
Year-End Review of Markets and Finance in Monday's edition should have been 28.58%. It was incorrectly
given as 23.58% in the 1998 Scoreboard. (WSJ Jan. 6, 1999)
For markets world-wide, 1998 was the most volatile year since 1987. It was a turbulent year for politics as
well.
Troubles arrived early as rumors emerged of President Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
Nevertheless,
U.S. stocks rose as the trend toward megamergers continued. Daimler-Benz said it would merge with
Chrysler, and Travelers Group said it would combine with Citicorp. Blue-chip indexes rallied through July. By
August, the tide began to change. Asia's problems continued to mount, while Mr. Clinton acknowledged he in
fact had an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Russia let its currency tumble and effectively
defaulted on its debt, causing panic in almost all emerging markets.
One of the highest profile casualties was Long-Term Capital Management LP. As bearish sentiment began to
prevail on U.S. markets, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan then launched a series of rate cuts.
Unexpected GOP defeats in the November election left the House of Representatives in a state of chaos.
Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned under fire. Weeks later, his successor, Robert Livingston, stepped down.
Still, Republicans stood firm, as Mr. Clinton became only the second president to be impeached by the
House.
The long-running dispute with Iraq came to a head late in the year, as Saddam Hussein refused to let U.N.
inspectors into the country. The U.S. retaliated with air attacks. For commodity markets, particularly oil, 1998
was a bust. This paved the way for what would be the largest takeover in history as Exxon agreed to acquire
Mobil. In the end, perhaps the biggest surprise came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500
turned in another year of double-digit gains.
Here is a summary of the news events chronicled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. The dates
reflect when the items were published.

U.S. Firms, Honed in Huge Home Market, Are Poised to Pounce in the New Europe

LONDON -- American companies stand to win big from the euro.
After all, the new European currency will do a lot to make Europe more like the U.S. By further pulling
together a market of 292 million people, the euro will speed up the elimination of regional differences in
everything from government red tape to computer prices to the kinds of shampoo that consumers prefer.
Economies of scale, in which U.S. companies excel because of the big American domestic market, will
become increasingly significant.
"American companies like the euro because they see cost reductions," says Fred Irwin, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Germany. "They also see this as the first step toward harmonizing
systems between the different countries."
The U.S. market numbers about 268 million people. The euro-zone has 24 million more, giving it greater heft,
but differences on tax rates, regulations and even technical standards such as the shape of electric sockets
make it tough to sell across the continent.
Rob Hayward, an economist with Bank of America in London, says Europe's economy is only 50% as
integrated as America's. But after the first few years of the euro, the number will rise to 60% or 70%, he says.
Indeed, U.S. companies see the euro as only the first step in a much broader shift to a truly single market.
That plays into American hands. Procter & Gamble Co. has a head start over much of its European
competition because it has been operating as a pan-European company for several years. On a continent
littered with national brands, P&G already offers a number of Europewide brands, including Ariel laundry
detergent, Pampers diapers, Always feminine hygiene products and Pantene shampoo. Although it will cost
money to update its information systems and train employees to deal in euros, P&G expects to save money
by becoming more efficient and by eliminating the financial costs of dealing in multiple currencies.
Coca-Cola Co. also believes it is in a good position to profit from the euro. Europe accounts for 29% of
Coca-Cola's revenue and 27% of its profit. Converting to the new currency will be relatively easy for the
company. It has been using a precursor to the euro-ECUs, or European Currency Units-for internal
bookkeeping for several years.
What will be interesting for the softdrink giant is to see whether the retail prices of its products converge.
Higher labor and distribution costs help explain why a can of Coke in Frankfurt costs 90 cents, compared with
53 cents in Madrid. Then there are taxes, which in Nordic countries are especially high: In Denmark, the
government levies account for about 25% of the total cost of a Coke.
With currency union, the price differences will become obvious to anyone looking at a price tag. So retailers
will either have to lower prices or watch consumers take their business elsewhere.
That's already happening on the border between Luxembourg and Belgium. In Luxembourg, taxes account
for about 3% of the retail price of a Coke. In Belgium, it's 30%. And because Luxembourg and Belgium
already share the Belgian franc as their currency, it's easy for consumers to exploit the differences. Last year,
per capita purchases of Coke in Luxembourg were nearly double those in Belgium. Coke officials attribute the
difference to people in Belgium scooping up cheaper Cokes on jaunts into Luxembourg.
American financial services could reap the biggest gains. General Electric Capital Corp., the finance arm of
General Electric Co., has been busily preparing for the euro by buying dozens of insurers and finance
companies. Free from the obligations of having to be all things to all customers, like a big European bank, it
can target the most profitable areas. Its profits easily outdistance those of banks and insurers much larger in
size.

--- Page 98 ---

American investment banks, meanwhile, are also looking forward to the euro. European banks have
traditionally looked at currency risk rather than credit risk in making decisions on fixed-income investments.
But currency risk -- the chance that a currency might rise or fall in value-disappears with the euro. American
companies are used to evaluating credit risk, which is the financial strength of the company or country issuing
bonds.
When it comes to evaluating stocks, a similar shift is happening. Until recently, European banks considered
the industry a company is in a more important criterion for judging its worth than the company's individual
business. American banks have always sized up companies one by one. "We have these platforms already in
place," says Lutz Raettig, head of the German office for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "We are extremely
well-positioned." Where the Europeans still have an advantage is in client relationships with midsize
companies, he says.
In technology, American companies are moving to pounce on what they expect will be a euro-induced
explosion in Internet shopping for computers and software. Apple Computer Inc. is launching online stores in
six European countries in tandem with the euro's debut. Apple has brought all of its computer prices in line
across Europe-excluding local value-added taxes and shipping costs -- and will allow customers to configure
and buy their computers online in either euros or local currencies. "We had been bringing our prices closer
together anyway, but the euro really made us get it done quickly," says Diego Piacentini, head of Apple's
European operations.
The advantages for American companies don't mean they will have an easy time in Europe. Kimberly-Clark
Corp., the maker of Kleenex tissues, got caught napping two years ago when Spanish and Italian tissue
producers slashed prices at a time it was expanding its European output. Kimberly-Clark responded by
cutting production and laying off hundreds of workers. Whirlpool Corp., the big appliance maker, also found
that Europe had unanticipated challenges. The local competition has held up surprisingly well against the
powerful American competitor.
And the same American companies that will profit from the euro in Europe had better watch their backs,
because they might face tougher competition from European companies back in the U.S. "Lots of people
attribute the success of U.S. companies to the size of the domestic market," says Bank of America's Mr.
Hayward.
If Europe becomes a genuinely single market, that advantage will vanish. Companies such as Germany's
Volkswagen AG and the French insurer Groupe Axa SA will have the advantage of selling into a home market
bigger than the Americans' turf.
"The new environment will be favorable for building tougher multinationals," says Jose Luis Alzola, an
economist with Salomon Brothers in London. "It won't happen overnight, but the euro will be conducive to that
result."
