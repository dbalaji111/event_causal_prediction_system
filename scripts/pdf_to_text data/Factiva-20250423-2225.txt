Commodity prices crept up just enough last year to leave metals producers, livestock farmers and oil refiners
optimistic for 2000 -- but quietly enough not to strike inflation fear in the hearts of investors.
That is because the market still had its share of losers. Already depressed grain prices dropped even more in
the fourth quarter, and strong supply held tropical "softs" such as orange juice and cocoa down all year.
Despite its ballyhooed run-up in the fall, gold actually ended the year up slightly after a wild roller-coaster
ride.
As a result, the performance of the major commodity indexes was lackluster into early or mid-1999, before
they made their sharpest gains as energy prices in particular began to increase on surprising news that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was sticking by its promised production-cutting schedule.
The Bridge-CRB Index of 17 commodities hovered for most of 1999 around the 191.22 mark at which it
ended 1998, until making its first close above 200 in September. The index finished last year at 205.14, up
13.92 points, or 7.3%, for the year. The energy-heavy Goldman Sachs Commodity Index jumped 803.92, or
41%, to 2769.56 after a run-up that coincided strongly with crude's rise beginning in the spring.
Economists generally expect commodity prices to keep rising in 2000, although there is little consensus on
how strong the rally will be. Energy prices could swing widely, based upon the whims of Iraq's Saddam
Hussein or a few OPEC members. Other commodities that jumped from historic depths when Asia's economy
began recovering -- as copper, in particular, did in 1999 -- may be destined for more-modest gains.
"On a historical basis, commodities are still in the low range, even if this has been a good year," says Jim
Glassman, senior U.S. economist for Chase Securities Inc. "I look at what's gone on this year as sort of a
renormalization, really."
After a two-year bear market, 1999 offered a breath of fresh air for many commodity markets that were
hovering near historic lows at the year's outset. But as the stock market stayed high and unemployment low,
and inflation remained in check, by year's end some analysts were saying commodity markets were losing
their correlation with economic moves. The country has become more dependent on services, the Internet
and other drivers that rely less on raw materials than intangible information and skills.
Meanwhile, the futures exchanges, where commodities changed hands in 1999, almost universally embraced
electronic trading, and partnerships with European markets that have become the commodity world's
technological leaders. The biggest of those alliances came at the Chicago Board of Trade, where members
first rejected, then resoundingly approved, a linkage with Eurex, an all-electronic German-Swiss market. That
joint venture, which links the world's two largest derivatives markets, expects to launch its unified trading
platform in mid-2000.
Here is a review of major markets last year:
Oil and Natural Gas
Like the weather or an Internet stock, commodity oil proved tumultuous in 1999.
The year began on a bearish note, as the price of West Texas intermediate crude lingered close to the
decade low of about $9.40 a barrel, reached in December 1998. By November 1999, that same crude was
selling for about $28, the highest price since the Gulf War. It closed the year at $25.60 a barrel, up 112% for
the year.

In between, retail gasoline prices shot to $1.28 a gallon from January's 95 cents, Saddam Hussein flexed
some newfound muscle by threatening to hold back Iraqi oil and one unfortunate company, Plains All America
Pipeline LP, lost $160 million when a trader apparently bet prices would go the other way.
The reason for the run-up was no mystery. In March, OPEC agreed to cut production by 2.1 million barrels a
day. At the same time, economies in Asia and Latin America found more solid footing, increasing demand.
By the third quarter, total supply of crude and its substitutes fell to 73.4 million barrels a day from 75.2 million
in the first quarter, according to the International Energy Agency. Meanwhile, demand overtook supply, rising
to 74.8 million barrels a day.
Analysts warn the party won't last forever, though. Higher prices will bring many players back into production,
and some oil-rich nations have hinted they don't want prices to remain high much longer. "Let's not let $25 oil
go to our heads," says Alan Struth, an economist with Honeywell Hi-Spec Solutions Inc., a Houston
consulting firm.
The oil price rise stole some thunder from natural gas, which many had expected would be 1999's big winner.
Following several warmer-than-expected winters, natural-gas production had eased somewhat, leaving bulls
hopeful that supply would fall more in line with demand by year end.
But the year began with another warmer-than-expected winter. Temperatures dipped at the end of the year,
boosting January 2000 natural gas to $2.44 per million British thermal units, up from the about $2 average
price of 1998 but still below the $3 some analysts had been predicting.
Precious Metals
Gold took commodity investors on what was by far their year's wildest ride. The result was a 40-cent net price
rise for 1999 to $289.60 an ounce on Nymex's Comex division that belies the volatility gold investors
experienced for the year.
After closing 1998 at $289.20 an ounce on the Comex division, gold declined steadily before registering
several 20-year lows over the summer and bottomed Aug. 25 at $253 an ounce.
Cheap gold lending by major gold houses, combined with constant rumors that governments planned to sell
some of their holdings, pummeled prices on world markets. The announcement by the Bank of England in
May that it would conduct a series of 25-ton auctions of its gold started the summer's final downtrend. But the
announcement by 15 European central banks Sept. 26 that they would limit their annual gold sales for the
next five years reversed the metal's fortunes, helping prices rise even more quickly than they had fallen.
Gold rallied a staggering $35.80 in one week and continued on to a year high of $324.50 Oct. 8. That left
many analysts saying its outlook had fundamentally turned bullish after more than a year of languishing
prices. "Gold has now become a reserve asset once again. It's become an asset that pays a high yield," says
Frank Holmes, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Global Investors Inc.
That bullishness is largely intact as the market heads into 2000, despite gold's steady decline in the fourth
quarter, which was accelerated by the Dutch central bank's announcement last month that it will sell as
much as 300 tons of its metal.
Meanwhile, gold took other precious metals along for its wild ride last year, though many have done a better
job of maintaining the gains that coincided with gold's run-up. Silver rose 9% to $5.453 an ounce on Comex,
and platinum climbed 18% to $430.20 an ounce on Nymex.
Analysts say the whole precious-metals group should continue to benefit in 2000 from the recovering Asian
economy, where India is a particularly large consumer of material for jewelry.
Base Metals
Copper led this group, increasing 28% to 85.25 cents a pound on Comex amid improving fundamentals and
producer consolidation. As with many commodities, however, that performance was an improvement only on
a price that was already depressed amid a glut. Nickel, aluminum and other base metals are still facing a
similar oversupply as 2000 begins.
Indeed, copper's average daily price in 1999 was its lowest in 13 years, says analyst John Gross, publisher of
the Copper Journal newsletter. To continue copper's gains, analysts agree, it will need further production
curbs and increased efficiency, particularly from Phelps Dodge Corp., which completed its merger with rival
Cyprus Amax last month to become the world's second-largest copper producer, after Chile's Codelco. "I
believe that we're at the beginning of a rally that's going to last, but this is still something of a transitional
period," says Mr. Gross. "Asia is an important part, as are the other parts of the demand picture."

On the London Metal Exchange, a metric ton of aluminum rose 32% for the year to $1,650.50, while zinc rose
33% to $1,235.50 and nickel rose 105% to $8,472.50.
Agriculture
Both livestock and grain farmers were battered by historically low prices in 1998. In 1999, one group's
fortunes improved markedly, while the other's actually got worse.
Soon after hitting 50-year lows, cattle and hog prices began a recovery in mid-1998 that lasted through 1999,
as cattle ended the year up 13% at 68.475 cents a pound, while live-hog futures rose 67% to 54.5 cents a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
But oversupply of corn, wheat and soybeans led to lower prices, even amid a searing Midwestern drought. By
year end, the prospect of cheap and sizable foreign grain harvests was cutting grain prices even more on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Corn fell 4% for the year to $2.045 a bushel, while wheat declined 10% to $2.485 a
bushel. After closing at $5.3775 a bushel in 1998, front-month soybean futures fell steadily to $4.10 a bushel
on July 8. The contract recovered to $4.6175 a bushel to finish the year down 14%.
With prices so depressed, livestock farmers who use grain as feed for their herds have begun to substitute
the various crops for each another more often, favoring whichever is cheapest. That further pinches grain
prices, says Steven P. Bruce, a grain broker for ED&F Man International Inc. Victor Lespinasse, an analyst at
the brokerage house A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. of St. Louis, says: "We'll have to see how the weather and
the inventories shape up as we get closer to the growing season. But right now it doesn't look good."
Tropical Commodoties
Huge cocoa crops in West Africa, the world's leading growing region for the crop, caused prices to plummet
39% in 1999 to $837 a metric ton on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of
Trade. The unsold yields remain in warehouses, where they likely will continue to restrain prices in 2000,
analysts say.
The price registered a 25-year low of $792 a ton in November, and by year end Ivory Coast cocoa farmers
were threatening to burn parts of their crop to protest low prices. Growers there have been particularly hard
hit by falling prices since the Ivory Coast government ended a system last year under which cocoa prices
were fixed from the farm to the warehouse.
Although no other commodity's outlook remains as murky for 2000 as cocoa's, other parts of the "softs"
complex showed mixed results for 1999. Cotton declined 24% to 50.74 cents a pound. Orange juice fell 13%
to 88.95 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade.
Analysts are expecting the price of orange juice to remain low in 2000, given the expectation of strong
harvests in both Brazil and Florida, where growers are predicting they will reap more than 200 million boxes
of fruit this season.
"Right now is probably a buyer's market," says Kathleen Chiappone, futures specialist for Fimat USA. But she
adds that "traditionally, the market doesn't stay under 80 cents or 90 cents for very long."
Coffee was the one bright spot in 1999, rising 7% to $1.259 a pound on the CSCE. The commodity declined
steadily from the summer through the fall, before hitting a low of 80.3 cents a pound Sept. 20 and recovering
steadily since.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Kim Polese is a rich, successful and troubled entrepreneur. One of the few female
chief executives in Silicon Valley, she is co-founder of Marimba Inc., which makes tools that help big
companies update their software. Following its 1999 initial public offering, Marimba, with fewer than 200
employees, soared as high as $1.4 billion in market value.
Thirty-eight years old, Ms. Polese made her name as product manager for Sun Microsystems Inc., where she
played a leading role in establishing the company's Java programming language. She studied biophysics at
Berkeley and computer science at the University of Washington.
Along the way, Ms. Polese developed strong views about the future of entrepreneurship and software
development. But she also acquired nagging doubts about the sustainability of the IPO boom, the sky-high
Internet market caps and the evaporation of social values in Silicon Valley.
She was interviewed in her office at Marimba on a morning when everyone was running late due to severe --
and worsening -- local traffic congestion. Following are some of the highlights of the conversation.
The Wall Street Journal: We're sitting right here at ground zero of what may very well be the greatest
explosion of wealth in human history. How long can it last?
Ms. Polese: You know, I wonder about that all the time. It is in many ways obscene wealth. It's extreme. I
can't imagine people creating this kind of wealth long-term. This to me is recognition of the importance of the
Internet as a major cultural, social, economic shift. And the people and companies who are at the formation of
that are being rewarded. But within the next five years, I believe that the Internet will become an essential
part of the way that any company does business.
WSJ: It will recede into the background?
Ms. Polese: Yes, you won't really talk about an Internet company any more than you would have talked about
a company that uses electricity as an electric company at the beginning of this century. When it becomes
clear that brick-and-mortar companies can compete, the smart ones can compete very effectively against
some of the new up-and-coming pure plays that have been anointed the next Fortune 10 -- I think that's when
the speculative nature of this whole Internet space will calm down. The solid companies will emerge. And I'm
looking forward to that, because it is sometimes frustrating to be lumped in with that sort of Internet-company
frenzy.
WSJ: So a Gold Rush mentality has taken hold -- a wealth panic?
Ms. Polese: There definitely is a Gold Rush mentality. There's also sort of a carpetbagger phenomenon going
on, where people all over the world are flocking to Silicon Valley. And there's this belief that you can become
a millionaire overnight.
WSJ: You can't get a hotel room within 20 miles of this place.
Ms. Polese: It's crazy. You can't get a restaurant reservation. You've got rush hour at 10 a.m. What's
interesting about it is that the technology that's supposed to make it possible for us to live anywhere and work
anywhere doesn't seem to ring true here. Everyone is coming here to be together physically.
WSJ: Why is it so important that people come together physically -- even here, where you people design
products that are supposed to free them from doing so?
Ms. Polese: Because it's "the deal" -- the value of meeting in cafes or in a bookstore or the grocery store, the
power deals that go down at soccer games here in Palo Alto.

WSJ: Kids' soccer games?
Ms. Polese: Yes, between the parents. It's the birth of a new industry. And the power brokers are really out
here in that industry. That's human interaction. You can't do that through the Internet or wireless or whatever.
WSJ: The need for human interaction is especially great when the stakes are high.
Ms. Polese: Nothing will ever replace it.
WSJ: The "full-bandwidth" experience.
Ms. Polese: Right.
WSJ: You mentioned the birth of electricity. Most technologies have periods of fabulous advance and then
they plateau. At what point does your industry -- I mean software and computing -- begin to level out? How
much longer can you live on Moore's Law -- the doubling of computing power without an increase in cost?
Ms. Polese: Well, there are different angles on that. One is that you can't imagine how far miniaturization can
go. It seems almost infinite, when you imagine computing devices and intelligence and access to the Net
being embedded in everyday devices and pieces of paper. There's a tremendous amount of research and
development and product development in companies. So on the one hand, I don't see an end to Moore's Law
in sight today on just how far the technology can go.
However, when I think about basic connectivity, and I think about just the devices we will use to communicate
with each other -- the cell phones, the PDAs [personal digital assistants], the wireless -- at some point that will
reach a saturation level.
WSJ: And then?
Ms. Polese: At that point, what will really add value will be the services that companies offer. We're already
seeing that happen in every industry here in Silicon Valley. Even a company like Intel, for example, a
venerable hardware developer, is now getting into providing outsourced application services. I mean, what a
radical shift! It gives you an indication of just how seriously companies are taking this services model.
So when I think about the companies that will do well in the growth industries, I think about the companies
that will be really sharp, super-smart, about putting together unique services that no other company can
match. We are seeing the beginnings of this with the free PC -- you know, giving away PCs so that you can
stick the needle in the arm and get people to sign up for the Internet service. And then we are going to see
layers on top of that, many layers on top of that. Instead of basic Internet connectivity, how about a service
that manages your finances? Or the game channel or whatever. It is the transaction level. It is the monthly
fee. It is the subscription. It is being attracted to a service. And then a company that succeeds will be the one
that locks you into that service.
You can see it already in the value Wall Street attaches to pure software and pure hardware companies vs.
companies that are incorporating a services model in their business. Instead of throwing that product over the
wall to a company and making them install it and learn how to use it, you set up a service and enable
companies to subscribe.
WSJ: Do you think software development as a skill, as a career, will remain as vital as it is today? Or is there
a point at which software development becomes like manufacturing, or like agriculture before that: something
so automated that it recedes into the background of economic life?
Ms. Polese: I think that software-coding tools will get better and better. The libraries of code will get more and
more complete and easier to interface to. So I do believe that there will be armies of software programmers
who can go to trade school to learn how to create these programs, and these applications. But even
stretching way into the future, there will be a need for creativity -- the creativity of thinking about the
architecture of a software application or device or network. That's where the brilliance will still be required, for
decades and decades and maybe millennia to come. There's a creative aspect to software development that I
think many people aren't aware of. In fact, in our own company here and in other places in the Valley, many
people I know who are software developers are also musicians and artists because it is spatial reasoning, it's
patterns, it's fluidity. There is a lot more to it than just sort of cranking out boring code.
I think we're actually just at the beginning of seeing a whole generation of da Vincis in software development,
the creative part. It's about envisioning patterns and architectures and the way networks work together.
WSJ: So these da Vincis, their "Last Supper" would be what -- the architecture for some sort of application?
Ms. Polese: Yes, something like Java. Or you look at Linux and how Linus Torvalds is gaining tremendous
attention. [Mr. Torvalds is the originator of Linux, a free operating system built by volunteer collaborators

around the world.] He was at the birth of something that will be clearly becoming a very key part of these
systems that will run the network.
WSJ: Do you think we're reaching a point where creativity threatens to overtake capital as the main constraint
in commercial life? Isn't it easy to imagine that the real value will increasingly come not from people who can
get the money together but those who can bring the brains together?
Ms. Polese: Yes, absolutely. Again, it's one of the reasons people flock to Silicon Valley: the knowledge of
where the brilliance is. In fact, when I think about the kinds of companies that will exist, and even when I think
about how we're going to grow our own company, more and more we'll go outside of this region to have
programmers located in other parts of the country and other parts of the world. We become a virtual team in
many ways. It is becoming more and more possible. And even with the services model that I talked about
earlier, you can have people in far-flung places who are providing a service, like customer support, or running
a server and providing data back, that don't have to be located here.
WSJ: A minute ago you mentioned Linux. Do you think we're going to see more and more development
conducted through open-source-type initiatives -- giving away software code so anyone can make
improvements?
Ms. Polese: I do. Because every time some company tries to do something proprietary, there's a whole wave
of people, companies, the industry, that rises up against that. We've all lived through proprietary interfaces
and hardware platforms and operating systems, and it's a nightmare. Java was a response to that, and Linux
is a response to that. That's the power of a large group of people banding together, creative people, who
have been burned before, who want the right thing to happen, who want the Internet to be truly ubiquitous. It's
an amazing thing.
WSJ: What's the open-source movement telling us about the future of commerce, when these people give
away so much work with no assurance of a personal financial return?
Ms. Polese: Because the formula works. It is being proved again and again -- with Java, with Netscape,
others. Look at Sun and how it has profited from Java. Not from a pure dollar exchange for Java itself, but for
all the businesses that it can now build on top of that platform. There are many examples now over the last
couple of years that show very clearly that huge multibillion-dollar businesses can be created, wealth can be
created. And, in fact, when we left Sun at the end of '95 to start this company, we were looking at the
proliferation of Java everywhere. We knew that a lot of people were going to build great companies on top of
Java.
WSJ: That's why you formed Marimba?
Ms. Polese: Exactly. Anytime that there is a platform that connects so many people, platforms, networks,
hardware architecture, operating systems, there is wealth that will be created on top of that. And those who
are present and part of creating the basic platform have a better vantage point.
WSJ: But you have to give in order to get, right? You have to give something away with the prospect, but not
the assurance, of a return. Doesn't the concept of return on investment fall apart in a world like that?
Ms. Polese: Yes, but this industry right now is so much a game of being a step ahead of anybody else and
seeing the opportunity first. Because all the development is happening so fast. The speed, the pace at which
we are moving, is incredible. It is breathtaking. Anyone you talk to in this valley, the most plugged-in people in
the world, will tell you they can't keep up with it. So the key becomes being the first to see a trend, being the
first to be part of creating a trend -- and then capitalizing on that trend. And that all happens within a very
compressed time period. So that's why there is value associated with giving something away free. You can
see what comes after that.
WSJ: These days, business models have a half-life of about five minutes. Is that mainly because we are in a
turbulent transitional time, or has the concept of corporate strategy been permanently changed to something
without fixed goals and plans?
Ms. Polese: It's the network. When I think of what's making this happen, what is causing that change, it is the
power of the network, the fact that the best-laid plans might be totally worthless six months from now because
there is some new open-source movement that occurred and now there are 100,000 programmers who are
developing a product that competes directly with yours -- which was proprietary. The shifts can come so
suddenly and be so huge you can't predict anymore what should happen in an orderly fashion. And so any
company that has a hope of surviving in this industry has to fundamentally re-examine its strategy on a
monthly basis. It's not a badge of shame to change your business plan or throw away the old ideas. It is a
badge of courage, really, because you're dead if you don't.

WSJ: You were part of a large organization, and you and your co-founders sprung out like a dandelion seed.
How quickly are the barriers to entry declining in this and other industries generally? Even while the big get
bigger, are we at the beginning of a secular wave in entrepreneurship?
Ms. Polese: I think it's already a tsunami. If you look at the number of IPOs that are stacked up this year, it is
just staggering -- so many start-up companies that the market is saturated. In some ways, I think what we are
seeing today is definitely going to slow down from an IPO, public-market perspective. And a lot of these
companies will fail. A lot of the ones that have gone public and will go public in the next year will fail. They
shouldn't be public. It's premature.
WSJ: But that's just one layer of the entrepreneurial world. For every company that goes public, there are
thousands formed that never do.
Ms. Polese: That's very true. That's something that I think we'll continue to see more and more of. It's
because a core team of people, just a very small team with an idea and a passion and talent, can do amazing
things that could take a large company five years to do.
WSJ: From all you see around you here, how much of the entrepreneurial motivation is driven by freedom
and personal fulfillment? How much of it is driven by the money?
Ms. Polese: It is a question I ponder a lot as I'm stuck in traffic on [U.S. Highway] 101. I worry about this
because I feel more and more the greed factor and these absurd expectations that you should be worth $50
million by the time you are 30, or you have failed in some way. And the young people coming out of college
and applying for jobs for the first time, this is their first experience. They think this is what the real world is
like. It's not!
You look at an Andy Grove, a Scott McNeally or a John Chambers [of Intel Corp., Sun Microsystems and
Cisco Systems Inc., respectively], and they worked for decades to get to where they are. And going public
after five years was considered very aggressive. And if a stock climbed $10 within the next five years, it was a
great thing. So I think we really are in a period of irrational exuberance, as [Alan] Greenspan would say. Or
just pure insanity. And the greed factor is definitely there. I worry about it also because I grew up here in the
Bay area, and I see this place changing around me. And I know I am part of the problem, I am helping create
the problem in many ways by hiring people, bringing them here.
WSJ: You're telling me that you see electrical-engineering graduates who think they ought to be millionaires
at 23?
Ms. Polese: You're seeing research scientists and Ph.D.s who would be doing R&D, but who now see the
lure of becoming a billionaire. And they know they can go and do it. So we are even seeing the drain happen
in real time from Ph.D. programs and master's programs, people who aren't even completing their education
because they see the opportunities. I can't say I blame them, but I also worry about where the R&D is going
to come from. As a country, we haven't been putting money into basic fundamental research and
development. The companies are focused on product development. The big ones like Microsoft can afford to
do R&D, but that's Microsoft's domain -- it is not the industry's domain. So I worry about creativity, innovation
and not only from a return to those values and absence of those values, but also where the new Internets are
going to come from.
WSJ: The proportion of women in the sciences generally, and studying computer science in particular, is not
only disproportionately low, but continuing to decline -- even now, in this high-tech economy. Why? Do you
have a theory?
Ms. Polese: It's that technology is scary. To some degree, at a certain point for girls in school, math and
science and technology become something to be afraid of, something that is not engaging and fun but
complicated and hard and scary. I have to look at the culture. I have to look at the media. I have to look at
advertising. I have to look at the images that are put in front of girls about who they should be and what they
should be, and it's all about how you look. And even a female executive in this industry gets a tremendous
amount of attention focused on that. If you go on the chat boards, after an appearance on CNBC, everybody
is talking about...
WSJ: How what a hunk Bill Gates is?
Ms. Polese: Right, or saying, "Boy, he's put on 25 pounds!" Unfortunately, this society still tells girls that what
matters most is how they look. And that the ultimate achievement is becoming a sex object to be admired and
desired.
WSJ: But, certainly, the number of women going to college isn't declining, or the number studying the
humanities. So it's not like the culture is saying, "Just be an airhead." There is something about technology
that's putting off girls.

--- Page 16 ---

Ms. Polese: I think it's what I was saying earlier, that computers are still hard to use in many ways. It still
scares children. I think at a certain point guys, boys, don't get scared.
I think about when I was a kid and I grew up in Berkeley, the reason I didn't get afraid or turned off of
technology was there was a science museum called the Lawrence Hall of Science here, which is like the
Boston Computer Museum. And I went up there as a kid, and I played on the computers. There was a really
fun game called Eliza, which is as it turns out one of the first really significant AI [artificial-intelligence]
programs. It was a fun game, and that was my first interaction with computers. This was a place that made
science fun. At that critical time when a girl is 12 or 13, she's asking, "What am I good at? What can I do?
What can I be?" We need to make sure that girls as well as boys have had a chance to see technology as
something fun, science as something engaging and creative and amazing.
WSJ: What do you think are the consequences of the fact that women are drastically underrepresented in
these fields? Are there social consequences?
Ms. Polese: Certainly, one obvious consequence is that there won't be many women running large
technology companies.
WSJ: Or acquiring billion-dollar fortunes.
Ms. Polese: That's right. And if you look at a lot of the kingmakers today in this industry, it's the heads of
telecommunications, the networking companies. We are seeing women start to appear in e-commerce
companies. But when you look at the fundamental infrastructure and the build-out of the Internet, the
technology side, you see very few women playing an important role there. So that is one obvious
consequence. Knowledge of the systems will still be an increasingly valuable commodity. The people who
understand how these systems work and can architect them will be valued tremendously, and they'll be at the
heart of many great companies to be built. So one consequence is we won't see women doing that.
WSJ: Are there even consequences for the technology itself?
Ms. Polese: Technology is technology. A line of code is a line of code. So I am not sure I really see a
difference in the technology itself. Perhaps there is an effect in the companies, because I think women do
have in many ways a different managerial style that is less confrontational and that can still be very decisive
and powerful, that involves seeking out ideas and opinions from many. I hate to make generalizations like
that.
WSJ: Yeah, they're dangerous, but the reality is that there are differences in the aggregate. And some of
them show up in the workplace.
Ms. Polese: Right. And when I think about what will be important in companies today and certainly in years to
come, it will be making sure that you're tapped into the creativity in every part of your company, that you're
hearing from not just the lieutenants around you but from the people who are actually out there learning,
especially as this industry is changing so rapidly. At this company, I make a real effort to connect with every
employee and to learn from them and to ask them questions, because the insights you can gain are
tremendous.
WSJ: Let's stay on the subject of leadership. What does the furious rate of change sweeping organizations
imply for the leadership of those organizations?
Ms. Polese: Well, organizations are smaller and faster moving, so people leading these companies have to
be willing to immediately admit making a mistake and change course radically and regularly. So that is one
trait of leadership that is very different from the old world, where you had a 10-year plan and you stuck to it,
and you never admitted failure. Out here in Silicon Valley, failure is a badge of courage. It is to be admired.
When I look at resumes of people that I am hiring, if they have been through at least one failed start-up that is
a plus, a big plus. That is a gold star.
WSJ: Because failure is a great teacher?
Ms. Polese: Exactly. And they've probably seen situations in which change wasn't made, where there wasn't
that ability to do a radical course correction or throw away the old business model. And that's absolutely key.
Now, that's not to say that leadership means zigging and zagging. You still have a vision. You still keep
checking in with that vision and making sure it's the right vision. You adjust it if it is not. But you often have to
make radical changes along in your pursuit of that vision because the industry is changing so much.
WSJ: How about creating an environment where creativity happens? When people were extensions of the
machine -- whether the machine was a typewriter or an assembly line -- you had to operate within a job
description. Now companies have to innovate constantly. They have to use the eyes and ears of all their

--- Page 17 ---
Page 17 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
employees as sensors for the external environment. And they have to bring multiple brains together and
diverse brains together in order to create. You can't do all that with just stock options, can you?
Ms. Polese: After a certain point, you can't, because people get burned out. We are all running at a
tremendous pace here, and there is always the new challenge, the new peak to scale. You never rest. So
quality of life becomes important. And good companies will spend a lot of time constantly working on making
it even more enjoyable to be an employee, whether that means telecommuting two times a week or different
work hours. You know, fun stuff that brings people together. A sense of fun in the work place. A gym.
Massages. Games. The things that I think the venerable East Coast firms might turn their nose up at. It turns
out that you get a tremendous amount of productivity out of people if they feel it's a place that's welcoming,
that values them. And a lot of people almost live here. We have a couple of people who have literally lived
here, between trying to find a place to live in Silicon Valley. It is a different kind of work environment than that
of the past.
WSJ: Is there such a thing as a culture of creativity in an organization?
Ms. Polese: I think there is.
WSJ: Or a culture that can nurture it and a culture that can deaden it?
Ms. Polese: Yes, there are companies where you feel inherently when you walk in, that creativity is valued
and is nurtured. And there are others where you don't feel that. So it comes from the top. And it is borne out
in regular daily examples of rewarding people for creativity and creating environments. Brainstorm sessions,
brown-bag lunches and inviting people in. Exchanging ideas. Walking the halls and asking employees
opinions on things. You feel it, and it becomes something that is inherent to the company.
WSJ: Do you think values will play a more prominent role in the workplace? I mean not just the quality of my
workplace, but the role of my organization in society? Do people care about that stuff, or are they too busy
following their stock price?
Ms. Polese: I think at the beginning, in the froth-and-frenzy phase, people don't think about that. But that is
what keeps people at a company, a feeling that this is a company that is changing the world, and I want to be
part of that. This is not just a job, really -- this is a life experience. At least, that is the way I view what work
should be, because it's most of your waking hours. And it's my objective to create an environment where very
strong values are understood by the whole company.
We are changing the world. We're creating an infrastructure that will make it much more possible for
businesses to deliver powerful service in a cost-effective way. But separate from that, we are a company with
ethics. We are a company that deals fairly with people, with other companies, where values like execution
and follow-through, instead of concept and hype, define what we are. That's something people need more
and more in this day and age, in this environment, in this industry -- the values that feed us at the core as
human beings, connections with other human beings, a sense of belonging. And I think in this environment
we are not seeing a whole lot of it. But in years to come, I think we will see more people caring about that.
And I think there will be a backlash against all the greed. I think people are going to get just fed up and
realize it is not fulfilling. I look around me, and I have so many friends who started companies who are worth
$50 million and more, and they are depressed. They think that they've made it, and they take six months off
and they realize they're more depressed than ever. Because this wasn't really what ultimately it turned out
that life was all about. I look around me and I see unhappy billionaires, and I see them coming back again
and again to start another company. And what really attracts them is connecting with other people. It is the
team. It's creating something. It's having a mission. That's what turns people on. That's what life is about.
WSJ: In Silicon Valley, at least, it seems the path of entrepreneurship is building something fast and selling it
fast -- then you have a big party and build something again.
Ms. Polese: I think about that a lot. I mentioned Andy Grove earlier; even in this world of compressed time, it
still takes years to build a great company, no question about it. You can't get past basic requirements like
building a revenue base, creating new products, attracting great employees, retaining the ones that you have,
having the vision that makes sense, having the smarts to make the right partnerships in the industry. People
don't do that anymore. The entrepreneurial common wisdom is that the most important thing you do when
you're starting is deciding on your exit strategy. I really deplore that. Because no matter what the exit strategy
is, no matter whether you sell your company a year from now, if you are not focused on building something
great, if you are not focused on the long term, I think you are selling yourself short. And I think you are selling
your investors short, or not doing what you could.
WSJ: You're exiting on the low road.

Ms. Polese: Yes. I hope that out of the companies starting up today we'll see the venerable Ciscos, Suns,
Intels and H-Ps [Hewlett-Packard] coming out. But I worry that those values have seemed to be tossed aside
so quickly. I think it is going to take a lot of companies failing for people to return to the idea that it really does
take years to build something great. It does take commitment. Here at this company, I always focused on the
long term, and we have as a company been focused on that. That's hard when around you people are
becoming billionaires overnight, and your employees are being recruited away. It's a very strange
environment. So, we really have to focus on the old-fashioned stuff: loyalty, trust, delivering, execution.

The Wall Street Journal Millennium (A Special Report): Money & Markets --- Soft Money: Private
Internet "currencies" and other increasingly abstract forms of exchange may replace government
notes

The global monetary system of the next millennium may amount to a hill of "beenz."
Sure, plenty of dollars, yen and euros will be floating around as paper bills, coins and electronic transfers. But
government-backed notes increasingly will vie for wallet space -- or its cyberspace equivalent -- with private
Internet "currencies" that already are cropping up, like the beenz created by beenz.com, along with similar
units like "Flooz" and "Ubarter dollars."
"Digicash paracurrencies" is how Internet writer and artist Mark Amerika dubs these emerging coins of the
virtual realm. Companies and future celebrities could become the basis for tradable computerized value units
backed by their fame and fortune, he believes -- like General Electric dollars or Michael Jordan dollars or
Picasso dollars. "There are going to be all forms of currencies that coexist with each other," Mr. Amerika
says.
That evolution of money over the next millennium would, at one level, mark a logical continuation of the
development of cash over the past 3,000 years, from concrete to ever more abstract and diverse. But in
taking those trends to a new extreme, the change will raise intriguing questions about the true role and
meaning of money in an economy and in society. Why does money exist? Does the system require anything
concrete to make legitimate the universe of floating bits and bytes greasing the wheels of exchange? What
are the limits of faith that people will place in a promise that they hold something of value? When anybody
can issue cash, is anybody in control?
In some ways, the grand technofuture may look a lot like the past. And it may not be a smooth ride --
reminiscent, perhaps, of the chaotic early 1800s, when wildcat banks issued their own currencies.
"People are going to have to be more aware of who handles their money," says Jack Weatherford, author of
"The History of Money." "For 100 years, we've been so accustomed to the government taking responsibility.
In the old days, people had to weigh coins or bite them to make sure they were real."
Of course, the main purpose of money has always been -- and always will be -- the same: to facilitate
commerce. Business started as barter, when people traded goods of relatively equal tangible worth. But that
system had obvious limits. Short-lived items such as food couldn't keep their value for long. Transporting
goods, whether five cows or five bags of salt, was difficult. Values varied from region to region.
The first solution was coins, which emerged in Lydia near the Aegean Sea, in 640 B.C. Metal pieces were
weighed and stamped with their value, making transactions more convenient and values more standardized --
but heavy. Clearly, people needed something lighter as they traveled more frequently. Many began to see
advantages to storing money with a money lender and taking away a paper note in exchange.
Paper currency was used in 11th-century China and 14th-century Italy. Yet for centuries after that, people still
believed the paper should be fully backed by stores of metal. Through succeeding centuries, there was
increasing public trust in gold- and silver-backed paper notes as a form of currency. But in 1933 the U.S.
government stopped tying currency to a fixed price in gold, and instead moved to the dollar standard and the
elusive notion that the credibility of the U.S. Treasury backed up the notes.
"When you could no longer trust in gold, they invited you to trust in God," says currency artist J.S.G. Boggs,
alluding to the phrase on the back of U.S. notes. Quoted in Lawrence Weschler's book "Boggs: A Comedy of
Values," Mr. Boggs says "it was like a Freudian slip."
Checks and credit cards came into wide use by the 1970s, quickly replacing cash for most large transactions.
By the mid-1990s, bills and coins in the U.S. were largely relegated to the smallest of transactions, such as

paying cab fare or buying a newspaper. Three-fourths of all cash is now used for transactions valued at $20
or less, says Mr. Weatherford, the author.
With the development of Internet commerce and electronic cash, money has become even more ethereal.
U.S. consumers, who spent about $20.2 billion online in 1999, will spend $184 billion in 2004, according to
Forrester Research Inc.
Children growing up now are becoming increasingly comfortable with cashless commerce. Several Web sites
allow parents to create allowance accounts, which their kids use online.
Convenience is the main advantage of the future system, in which the transfer of money will be effortless. A
world traveler may never again have to exchange dollars for euros or pesos for yen, since "value" won't be
confined to national borders; instead, international "smart" cards will hold value in a microchip. And workers
will be able to say goodbye to being handed a paycheck. Just as spending in the future will deal in
intangibles, so will earning -- just a slick transfer of data from one account to another.
The touch of a button, or even just a quick scan of the microchip embedded in one's finger, may open the
door to the vault that holds their "money." Even pickpockets may have to use new techniques. If they can
break the codes that conceal passwords and financial information, they can drain accounts from any
distance.
"In 200 years we'll see the elimination of cash in almost all areas," says Tod Maffin, a business-technology
consultant in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Technology will facilitate not just the replacement of cold hard cash, but the proliferation of all different sorts
of "money." These are the next generation of long-existing reward programs issued by businesses to
encourage customer loyalty, like S&H Green Stamps, airline frequent-flier miles and supermarket coupons.
But their impact is magnified by e-commerce, which allows for the quick, mass creation and trading of "units"
of value.
One such currency is being spread by New York-based Flooz.com, a kind of one-step-removed variation of
official U.S. currency. Customers use conventional dollar-backed credit cards to purchase Flooz, then e-mail
them to someone else as a gift. This "gift currency" can be spent at 75 businesses, and Flooz.com says it
currently has about 150,000 users.
Beenz, launched in March 1999 in the U.S. and U.K., stray even further from the official currency system.
People can't buy beenz but must earn them as an alternative form of compensation by performing "e-work,"
such as providing e-mail or demographic information, reading a document or, in the case of one musical
group's site, listening to a song. The businesses awarding beenz pay beenz.com one cent each for them.
Beenz are then stored in the user's account and can be spent at retail sites, which receive a half cent for each
beenz they honor.
There are even exchange possibilities. Internet users may convert beenz into Flooz, with 200 beenz equaling
roughly one Flooz, or about $1. Flooz, however, can't be converted back into beenz.
In the typical setup, a user would have to do, say, about two hours of e-work, such as filling out forms and
answering surveys, at about 10 sites to earn the 3,250 beenz, or about $16.25, it takes to buy a compact
disk. Users of beenz so far have conducted about 12 million transactions, according to Glenn Jasper, a
beenz.com spokesman.
The company says it is mindful of its role in creating a parallel currency universe. Mr. Jasper ambitiously
describes the venture as a kind of "central bank of the Internet."
Then there are Ubarter dollars, a back-to-the-future blend of third-millennium digital cash and prehistoric
bartering. At Ubarter.com, businesses unload their excess inventory and get Ubarter dollars in return, which
they can use to buy excess goods other companies post on the site.
"Everybody has something in their garage, and its value diminishes over time and they've gotten their use out
of it," says Steve White, chief executive of Ubarter.com. Bartering "is a way for them to recoup part of that
asset."
It sounds like a grand technofuture of unprecedented efficiency. But the transition to that world may not be so
easy. The last time America saw such a broad proliferation of currencies was before the National Banking Act
of 1863. Back then, any bank that set up shop could issue its own paper exchange notes, backed by
whatever it decided was appropriate collateral.
Since many so-called wildcat banks sprang up at that time, they flooded the market with notes, and their
value sank. In addition, the banks often had such short lives that a traveler from California, for example,

--- Page 21 ---
Page 21 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
wouldn't know whether the bank note issued to him by one frontier bank would be accepted upon his arrival in
Texas.
The Internet could spawn its own wildcats: cyberbanks and companies handling transactions and issuing
currencies without regulations or a central bank to guide them.
Take beenz, for example. If 1,000 years from now it is still a popular Internet currency, many people will have
accounts holding hundreds or thousands of beenz. Mr. Jasper says beenz will be on safe ground so long as
businesses believe consumers should be rewarded for e-work. Indeed, banks might even start allowing
borrowers to use beenz as collateral, and the currency, if enough people are confident of its value, could
trade with other forms of money.
But what if several large vendors decide to stop honoring the stuff? Panic could ensue. Banks would call in
their loans, and consumers with piles of worthless beenz would lose faith in other paracurrencies. Since
national borders wouldn't confine the new currencies, the ripple effect would reach international proportions.
"The thing that has always scared me is a bunch of people issuing digital money who aren't insured and
aren't backed up," says Elinor Harris Solomon, author of the book "Virtual Money" and a former Federal
Reserve economist.
Indeed, such fears -- and other visceral feelings about money -- may make the dawning of a digital-cash age
less inevitable than experts think. For all the momentum toward replacing coins and bills, there also are
plenty of factors to keep them around. Money, after all, has endured to a degree unexplained by the limits of
technology alone. It isn't just about exchange. It's about culture. About national identity. About faith.
Mr. Boggs, the artist, has, in a sense, made a career out of testing the limits of faith embodied in money --
with mixed results. He creates altered versions of national currencies and then attempts to use them to buy
things, explaining at museums, restaurants and shops that it isn't traditional money but has its own inherent
value. As if mocking the "full faith and credit" claims of government notes, he sometimes labels his bank
notes, "I promise to promise to promise." Mr. Boggs amplifies the test by offering a bill with a larger "face
value" than the good he is purchasing, so that he must get change back in "real" money.
At times, Mr. Boggs succeeds in persuading vendors to take his version of cash -- transactions aided by the
fact that some dealers have valued his money as art worth upward of $100,000.
There are other reasons tangible money may never be fully eliminated. Some may always be needed to
legitimize all the digital cash replicating that currency.
"Going way back in the ages, money has always become money because of philosophical and tangible
attachments," Ms. Solomon says. "Trust is really at the bottom of any currency.... There has to be something
behind it or people won't use it."
"People are very concerned about money," adds Douglas Mudd, manager of the Smithsonian Institution's
numismatic collection. "It's hard to convince people to change, even when a change makes sense."
And there are still times when traditional money is useful, even essential. The tooth fairy, for now, deals in
quarters, not smart cards. The Salvation Army's bell ringers require coins in their Christmas kettles. And few
panhandlers will be accessing digital wallets.
Mr. Boggs thinks people will always want to have cash in some form, especially for making anonymous
purchases that can't be picked up by computers. "People will always want some form of private currency," he
says. "People do things they just don't want to be on record, like buying dirty magazines."

Are Gay People More Affluent Than Others? --- Advertisers Say Yes, Citing Surveys, but Activists Call

`Dream market". . ."creme de la creme" of consumers . . ."pot of gold at the end of the rainbow." Those are
just a few of the superlatives media and marketing executives have concocted to describe gay America in
terms of spending power.
Now consider these assessments of the same market from gay activists and academic researchers: "A
segment of the gay population is affluent, but more of us eat at McDonald's and shop at Kmart," one gay
activist notes. Another naysayer says flatly: "Gay wealth is a myth."
Who's right? A dearth of reliable demographic data on the gay market makes it hard to tell. But the debate is
increasingly contentious and has created rifts within the gay community. Marketers say gay Americans should
be recognized as a vibrant segment of the consumer market. But civil-rights advocates maintain that an
exaggerated image of comfort and success hurts their battles for protection from workplace discrimination,
the right to marry and other causes.
"We're not all a bunch of $100,000-a-year white guys who want to buy everything in sight, as a lot of early
studies of the gay market suggested," says Scott Seitz, a partner in Spare Parts Inc., a gay-marketing
consultancy in New York.
But nobody can command precise figures. Estimates of the income of the average gay male household have
ranged from $37,000 to $69,000, with some gay magazines claiming their readers' average household
earnings top $90,000. And no one can answer the even more fundamental question of how many gay men
and lesbians live in the U.S. Over the past 50 years, estimates have ranged from 3% to 10% of the adult
population.
The lack of precise data allows both sides to make their claims with relative impunity. Civil-rights advocates
maintain that the impression of gay affluence has shaped legal opinions. For example, in a dissenting opinion
in which he supported a Colorado referendum banning antidiscrimination laws protecting homosexuals,
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia said that gay people are politically powerful and enjoy "high disposable
income." Justice Scalia argued in the 1996 case that Colorado voters didn't "disfavor homosexuals in any
substantive sense" but had merely denied them "preferential treatment."
Gay-rights advocates say the stereotype of a moneyed minority is hard to fight. "Homophobic organizations
frequently cite [high income] figures to argue that gay people do not experience discrimination," says
Suzanne Goldberg, an attorney for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay advocacy group. "The
numbers have surfaced in antigay videotapes widely distributed to lawmakers. They have surfaced in fliers
asking people to give money and volunteer time in support of measures that would deny civil rights based on
sexual orientation."
Gay marketers don't deny that but lament the divisiveness of the issue in gay circles. "It's such a wedge in our
community," says Paul Poux, a gay man who runs a marketing consulting firm in New York. "I often have to
brace myself for this scolding I get from advocacy groups because I'm a marketer promoting the gay
community's disposable income. We shouldn't be fighting each other; we should be fighting to get more and
better data."
Ms. Goldberg supports a 1998 research report called "Income Inflation," published by the Policy Institute of
the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and written by Lee Badgett, an economics professor at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

Prof. Badgett analyzed seven studies that some consider the most statistically valid and the most
representative of the entire American gay community. While most of those studies suffer from small sample
sizes, they generally reach similar conclusions.
"The best possible data tell a very consistent story -- that the gay community is not an affluent elite," Prof.
Badgett says. "If anything, gay men are at a financial disadvantage to heterosexual men, probably because of
discrimination."
Prof. Badgett's report cites data from such organizations as the U.S. Census Bureau and the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, which respectively showed that around 1990 individual
income for gay men averaged $23,037 and $26,321, compared with $24,979 and $28,312 for heterosexual
men.
Lowell Taylor, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has analyzed surveys of gay
Americans, also believes many market-research studies overstate gay people's earnings.
"My sense is that gay men earn a little less than married men but are similar to heterosexual men who live
alone," Prof. Taylor says, adding: "Lesbians appear to earn more than other women -- probably because they
work more hours. Lots of married women don't work or work only part time, especially if they're raising
children."
Activists and academics contend that some of the most publicized market-research studies in the 1990s
created a false image of an economic elite because they were based on surveys of readers of gay
publications, members of gay social and political organizations, mail-order buyers and holders of gay affinity
credit cards -- all of whom lean toward the high end of the income scale. The studies also suffered from an
urban, upper-income bias, critics say.
"It's a very difficult market to study," says Todd Evans, president of Rivendell Marketing Co. in Westfield, N.J.,
which surveys readers of gay newspapers. "Surveys tend to be answered by people who are proud to be gay
and who are actively involved in the community. But outside urban areas, gay consumers are by and large
closeted and are afraid their sexual orientation will become public if they participate in the studies."
Simmons Market Research Bureau in New York said the average gay person's income was $47,000, but its
1997 study was limited to gay newspaper readers.
Overlooked Opinions, another market-research firm, found that gay male households reported average
income of more than $50,000 in 1990, compared with the national average for all households of about
$37,000. It reached survey respondents through bars, bookstores and pride festivals.
Jeff Vitale, president of Overlooked Opinions, defends the assertion that gay people, on average, are more
affluent than the general population. "That doesn't mean gay people don't need protection from discrimination
and hate crimes," he says. "But I don't think academics should distort the numbers just to make their case
with politicians."
By itself, the lack of consensus among the surveys and among the parties involved perplexes concerned
onlookers who have no axes to grind.
"I haven't found anything so far that is deeply persuasive, one way or the other," says Katherine Pease,
executive director of the Gill Foundation in Denver, which provides grants to gay and AIDS-related groups.
Some companies are conducting their own proprietary research, as well as cobbling together pieces of other
groups' studies of the gay market. Last year, Wilson Media Group Inc. in New York examined data on
homosexuals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Simmons Market Research Bureau and
other sources in a study related to an HIV drug of Wilson client Glaxo Wellcome Inc. Wilson then conducted
its own research online and by telephone.
"A lot of the information has a bias to it, either up or down, depending on which side of the coin you're on,"
says Tom Wilson, president of Wilson Media Group.
The Internet may eventually provide better demographic data, because many gay people are online and Web
surveys provide some degree of anonymity to people still in the closet. But for now, Internet survey data
appear skewed because the online gay population is believed to be somewhat younger, better educated and
higher-income than the overall gay market.
"Plus, there's still the problem of how you find the gay person who isn't hooked into anything -- magazines,
gay organizations or even the Internet," says Stephanie Blackwood, a partner in Spare Parts, the gay
marketing consultancy.

Nasdaq Retreats a Bit, as Blue Chips Climb

Nasdaq Retreats a Bit, as Blue Chips Climb

Keep that Nasdaq champagne on ice.
In another volatile day, the Nasdaq Composite Index made its best run yet at closing above the 4000
milestone before succumbing to a late-day sell-off that left it a bit below Monday's record at 3972.11.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a new record, setting up the stock market for a
strong close to 1999.
But continuing a trend that investors have seen for most of the year, bonds fell yesterday, and gold barely
moved. Even as stocks have soared, bonds and other alternative investments such as gold have done little
to shake their lingering "also-ran" labels among investors. Indeed, bond investors have experienced their
second-worst year on record this year.
The dollar was stronger yesterday.
The Nasdaq reached as high as 4022.51 before losing steam in the final half-hour of trading, the third day in
a row the average traded above 4000 intraday before falling back. The Nasdaq finished 3.27, or 0.08%,
lower, but it is still up a startling 81.2% on the year.
Some analysts said much of the selling was nothing more than year-end profit taking, as money managers
shifted into the biggest gainers of the year, and many predicted the Nasdaq would again challenge the 4000
threshold this week.
"People used the 4000 market as a signal to do some selling," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist
at A.G. Edwards & Sons. "There have been a few haves, and a lot of have-nots, this year, so a lot of people
wanted to show investors that they own the haves this year, and they sold the rest."
Finishing above the 4000 threshold would be a remarkable event for the Nasdaq: Just eight weeks ago it
topped the 3000 level. As recently as October 1998, the Nasdaq was trading below 1420.
The industrial average, padding its own impressive gains this year, yesterday climbed 85.63, or 0.75%, to
11476.71, up 25% on the year. Boosting the index was a $3.50-a-share rise in American Express, to $161.75,
amid a modest rally in financial stocks.
Continuing a recent theme, the market's gains were not evenly distributed. Advancing stocks barely topped
decliners on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bonds fell, continuing yearlong weakness, after data showed a 6% rebound in existing-home sales in
November and a jump in consumer confidence this month to the highest level in 31 years. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32, or 93.75 cents per $1,000 bond, to push up the yield -- which moves
opposite to the price -- to 6.470%.
With just 2 1/2 trading days left in the year (counting Friday's half-day New Year's Eve session), it is clear that
1999 will go down as one of the toughest for bond investors.
The 30-year Treasury bond's price is now down 8.60% on the year, making this the worst year for Treasurys
since 1994. The Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, which includes all types of bonds, has slumped almost 1%,
the second-worst year since the early 1970s.
Bonds have been under pressure all year -- first from fears of inflation, then because of jitters surrounding
potential year-2000-related computer bugs, and lately over concern that the Federal Reserve will unleash a
string of interest-rate increases next year.

--- Page 26 ---

Investors are licking their wounds. "No one came close to predicting the severity of the interest-rate rise" and
the difficulties in corporate bonds this year, says Howard Greene of Sun Capital Advisers, in Wellesley, Mass.
"We've had a rally lately in corporate bonds, but it's been a tough year."
Luckily, Mr. Greene has put his personal money in stocks, but adds somewhat ruefully: "Stocks are just my
hobby; bonds are my profession."
Meanwhile, gold closed at $290 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, up
$2 on the day. Gold has gained just $1.90 an ounce for the year. Gold investors haven't benefited from Y2K
jitters, nor have they seen an influx of interest as inflation edged higher, despite gold's longtime reputation
as an inflation hedge.
As stocks continue to drub other investments, fundamental changes in investor behavior are beginning to
appear. Insurance companies, pension plans and other investors who traditionally have stuck to bonds, for
example, are increasingly investing in stocks, helping the stock market rally but putting a damper on the bond
market.
Many argue that the stock market is now determining the fate of the bond market, a startling change from
recent years when the bond market and interest rates dictated the direction of stocks. Bonds may not see
any sort of meaningful rally unless stocks sell off and investors shift back into fixed-income investments,
analysts say. And with every rise in the Dow more wealth is created, encouraging consumers to spend their
cash and putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would put further pressure
on bonds in the new year.
"In many ways stocks are just recouping last year's underperformance against bonds" after the Russian bond
default, argues James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.
World-wide, stocks rose in dollar terms. Excluding U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.17,
or 0.62%, to 190.56.
In major market action:
Stocks were mixed. On the Big Board, where 654 million shares traded, 1,557 stocks rose and 1,522 fell.
The dollar rose. Late in New York, the currency traded at 102.35 yen and $1.0069 to the euro, up from
102.23 to the yen, and $1.0132 to the euro.

NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks rose solidly, posting sharper gains than the major stock-market
indexes.
The Russell 2000 small-cap index ended the session within 0.6% of its April 21, 1998, all-time high, closing
the day at its highest level since April 22, 1998. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose
4.02, or 0.83%, to 488.48; the Nasdaq Composite Index, at 3972.11, fell 3.27, or 0.08%.
The Nasdaq market was knocked into negative territory on a late-day wave of profit-taking that was
concentrated in the technology sector. Yesterday marked the first time during the past eight sessions that the
Nasdaq Composite Index didn't close at a record.
On the Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers, 2,198 to 2,099, on volume of 1.205 billion, compared with
1.132 billion Monday.
Internet Gold-Golden Lines, an Israeli Internet-services provider, almost doubled its market value, rising 13
7/8, or 97%, to a 52-week high of 28 1/8. The company said it will establish an Internet venture with Microsoft
Corp. to operate the software giant's MSN service in Israel.
Jostens, (NYSE) a Minneapolis maker of class rings, yearbooks and other graduation-related products, rose
5 15/16, or 32%, to 24 1/4. Investcorp, a global buyout firm, said that it and other investors agreed to acquire
Jostens for about $826 million, or $25.25 a share, plus the assumption of about $100 million in debt.
Separately, Jostens said it expects to take a fourth-quarter charge of about $13.2 million, or 40 cents a share,
which includes a charge to cut 100 full-time employees.
Jenny Craig (NYSE) surged 11/16, or 32%, to 2 13/16. According to the New York Times, the San Diego diet
company's new television spokesperson is Monica Lewinsky. The Times said the company declined to say
how much Ms. Lewinsky is being paid.
PopMail.com, an e-mail marketing company, leapt 17/32, or 22%, to 3 following news that the company
agreed to provide its permission-based e-mail marketing service to Nypost.com, the Web site of the New
York Post. PopMail.com said its Enewsnotifier service will allow Nypost.com to track readers' interests and
demographic information.
Orbital Sciences (NYSE), a Dulles, Va., satellite company, climbed 2 13/16, or 19%, to 17 9/16. Orbital said it
received a five-year contract valued at a maximum of $1.5 billion to produce and test satellites for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The company said the NASA contract is for small and
medium-class satellites used in space science, earth science and advanced technology missions.
Community Investors Bancorp jumped 1 1/16, or 14%, to 8 7/16 after the Bucyrus, Ohio, holding company
said its board authorized the repurchase of 10% of its common shares outstanding. The company said it
plans to spread the buyback over all of 2000.
Chiquita Brands International (NYSE), a Cincinnati produce company, rose 7/16, or 10%, to 4 13/16. A group
of investors that holds a 6.6% stake in Chiquita said American Financial Group, which holds about 40% of
Chiquita, recently told the investor group that Chiquita "may consider initiating an auction process that might
result in a sale of the issuer." Chiquita President and Chief Operating Officer Steve Warshaw in a statement
didn't confirm or deny that the company was considering an auction.
Checkers Drive-In Restaurants, a Clearwater, Fla., restaurant chain, tumbled 5/8, or 20%, to 2 1/2 following
news that it sold 13 Rally's restaurants in the Birmingham, Ala., market area to HJK for $3.7 million. Checkers
said it plans to use the funds to reduce its debt.

UniCapital (NYSE), a Miami equipment-leasing concern, fell 9/16, or 13%, to 3 5/8. UniCapital said it received
a $200 million warehouse credit facility from Morgan Stanley Asset Funding, a unit of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, and that it will use the facility to fund leases originated by its finance unit.
Global Imaging Systems slid 1, or 8.8%, to 10 3/8 after the Tampa, Fla., office- and imaging-equipment
company said its fiscal third-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' projections because of significant
customer deferrals from buying network services and other noncopier business until after the beginning of the
new year, primarily because of year-2000 uncertainties. The company also said its profit was hurt by higher
interest costs, and that the average rate on its floatingrate debt has risen more than 2.4 percentage points
during 1999.
The Russell 2000 small-cap index stands 2.93, or 0.6%, below its April 21, 1998, record close. On Oct. 8,
1998, the closely watched small-cap measure closed 181.13, or 36.9%, below its all-time high.
"Finally," said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum & Co., of the Russell 2000's
rebound. He acknowledged that he may be premature in his praises, but said that if and when the Russell
2000 does break its year-and-a-half-old record, "it will be a psychological positive" for the small-cap market.
"There's been an impressive pickup in the Russell's relative performance," he said, especially given the
group's heavy weighting of financial-services stocks, a group that has been heavily pressured by the rise in
interest rates during the past six months. The composition of the Russell 2000 also is skewed toward the
technology sector, but it has been the large-cap technology stocks that have been largely responsible for
Nasdaq's recent record-breaking streak.
Baum notes that in December, the Russell 2000 has outperformed both the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and the S&P 500 index.
While the recent performance of the Russell 2000 has been impressive, even if somewhat overshadowed by
the Nasdaq's surge, the best may be yet to come for small-cap stocks.
"I expect a significant push in the Russell early next year," Mr. Belski said.
As the new year develops, he expects to see a broadening of participation. "I think the market is setting up for
a first-quarter move to value stocks and deep cyclicals," groups that, to a large extent, have been left out of
the recent rally.

Coffee Falls on Brazil's High Crop Projection

Coffee Falls on Brazil's High Crop Projection

NEW YORK -- Coffee futures sank on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, after Brazil's government
issued a surprisingly high projection for its crop despite a severe drought.
The much-anticipated estimate for the 2000-2001 crop from the Brazil's Ministry of Agriculture came in on the
higher end of expectations at 28.9 million 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags, revised down from preliminary
projections of 40 million.
The government also revised upward its estimate for the 1999-2000 crop, putting it at 27.17 million bags, a
9.6% increase from its previous estimate of 24.8 million bags.
The March contract fell 14.6 cents to $1.207 a pound on the CSCE, a division of the New York Board of
Trade, after climbing steadily the previous few sessions in anticipation of a lower estimate, traders said.
Market expectations for the 2000-2001 crop ranged from 25 million to 29 million bags, but given Brazil's
tendency to underestimate the size of the crop, traders had presumed the figure would come in at the lower
end of the range. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer.
"The Brazilian government is known for low-balling their crop figures. If they say 29 million, they really mean
32 million," said Morty Fergenbaum, vice president of operations with Flavor Coffee, a Toronto roaster. "The
first estimates are always the lowest, so we might have more coffee next season than the market thinks."
One trader said that 26 million bags was a pivotal figure, with anything above that considered bearish and
anything below, bullish.
"The estimates have certainly taken the wind out of the bull's sails," another trader said, referring to rumors
that as much as 50% of the crop had been damaged by dryness. Futures rose recently on such talk.
At a news conference, Agricultural Ministry officials in Brazil said that of the total production, 23.1 million bags
will be of the popular arabica variety, while the remaining 5.8 million bags will be conillon.
Despite yesterday's losses, traders saw bullish long-term potential for prices.
Coffee sales from Brazil could slow in the next month, as the country enters its vacation season, one
participant said.
Others said weather would again become a focus if dry conditions pervade as the coffee berries mature.
"If dry conditions persist, we might rally above $1.50," said James Cordier, a broker with Liberty Trading in
Florida.
In mid-to-late January, Brazil will issue what traders consider to be more accurate forecasts for the size of the
2000-2001 coffee crop, traders added.
In other commodities markets:
PORK BELLIES: Futures settled much higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange following bullish supply
data released late Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nearby February belly futures rose 2.72
cents to 80.45 cents a pound, up most of the three-cent daily limit. The department's monthly Cold Storage
report showed a nearly 40% drop in the amount of stored frozen bellies as of Nov. 30 compared with a year
earlier.

GOLD: Futures prices surged, largely on technical factors. February futures rose $2.90 to $288.90 an ounce
on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after pushing through a series of buy stops,
traders and analysts said. Talk of the potential for the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates also
played a slight role. Some market watchers think the Fed will raise rates in February. Higher interest rates
typically reflect inflationary concerns, and gold is seen as a hedge against inflation.

Wall Street Deploys Troops to Battle Y2K---Nervous InvestorsHoard Cash, GoldAs Chaos Hedges
Your Money Matters
Wall Street Deploys Troops to Battle Y2K --- Nervous Investors Hoard Cash, Gold As Chaos Hedges

Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Many people are preparing for the year 2000 by stocking up on champagne and caviar. Joseph S.
Dombrowski has loaded up on gold coins.
A year ago, Mr. Dombrowski was fully invested in stock mutual funds. But during a two-month period,
beginning in December 1998, the Air Force officer moved 90% of his assets into American Eagles, Canadian
Maple Leafs and Vienna Philharmonics.
"If there are significant disruptions . . . I want a little safe harbor," he explains. If Y2K proves to be a
"nonevent," Mr. Dombrowski says, he plans to shift 99% of his assets back into funds early next year.
In case you've been paying less attention than Mr. Dombrowski, the Y2K problem is that older computers
programmed using two digits to represent the years could malfunction or even shut down entirely when Jan. 1
rolls around.
Banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions are well-prepared, government officials and other
experts insist. Although some glitches are likely, they say Y2K is likely to cause far fewer problems than
initially feared.
"All the data confirm our belief that major U.S. companies will be ready before the turn of the century," says
Lorraine Wang, associate U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
Some people, though, are preparing for the worst. Konstantin Kupfer, a jeweler in Burlingame, Calif., who
specializes in fine jewelry and high-grade watches, says he has sold "more than a couple hundred thousand
dollars" of gold coins to people with Y2K fears. "In the last eight or nine months, people have just come in
and asked for coins," he says. "Everyone said the same thing: When the crash happens, they will have to use
coins for survival."
Terence Hanlon, president of the metals division of Dillon Gage Inc. of Dallas, a full-service brokerage firm,
says that sales of gold coins to dealers are running 60% to 70% above normal holiday levels. "There are
[coin] dealers we supply who really created businesses geared strictly to Y2K," he says.
Stories of people who have stocked up on cash are also plentiful, although these people don't want to be
identified -- for obvious reasons. Terry Murray, chairman and chief executive of Boston-based FleetBoston
Financial Corp., recounts sitting next to a woman at a dinner in Newport, R.I., who said she was going to take
out $11,000 in cash and put it in her home in Vermont.
One well-to-do New Orleans businessman took out a few thousand dollars every time he deposited a
paycheck during the past year. His stash of cash, now well into the five figures, sits in a safe in his home.
Even fellow family members think he is overreacting, and he is vague as to what catastrophe he expects to
befall him.
To allay fears, the Federal Reserve is keeping more than $200 billion in cash on hand-something like an extra
$2,000 for every household in the United States. That doesn't include an additional $50 billion sitting in
commercial bank vaults, so there should be plenty to go around. Some banks plan to open Jan. 1 to ease
Y2K angst.
The Fed says currency in circulation was up 14% in November, about double the increase the Fed would
normally expect. "It's hard to say it's all Y2K," says Federal Reserve Board spokeswoman Rose Pinalto. "We
keep getting indications from retailers that there is a lot of spending."

--- Page 32 ---
Page 32 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Ms. Pinalto notes that most Americans don't seem particularly worried. Only 5% of those polled by the Gallup
Organization say they are "very concerned" about Y2K. That is down from 11% in March, according to the
Gallup survey, which was released in November by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Sixty-four percent say they are "not too concerned" or "not at all concerned," the poll found.
But Mr. Dombrowski with his gold coins isn't most investors. "It's kind of an unpopular position to take," he
says, but "I'm glad I'm here."
And he certainly isn't alone in acting on his concerns. Over the past two months, Peter Hitch has sold most of
the stocks held by four family trusts he manages. "The gain we could make over a 30-day period, from Dec.
15 to Jan. 15, is minimal compared to the risk of leaving it there," he says.
Mr. Hitch, who handles acquisitions for pickle manufacturer M.A. Gedney Co., Chaska, Minn., is reducing the
trusts' stock-market exposure to 10% of total assets. To minimize the tax hit, Mr. Hitch is holding on to stocks
that have a low cost basis. "The sale of that stock would be a huge tax implication for the trust," he explains.
Or consider Larry Kunkel, a manufacturer's representative in the Midwest who sells printing and
packaging-related items. At the beginning of this year, he told his five brokers that at some point in 1999 he
would issue an order to shift entirely to cash or U.S. Treasurys.
He isn't as worried anymore, in part because he's been listening to Michael Chasnoff, a Cincinnati financial
adviser who works with him. "This is a short-term phenomenon," says Mr. Chasnoff. "We prefer to ride it out."
Still, Mr. Kunkel is hedging his bets. He began selling the stocks in tax-deferred pension, profit-sharing and
annuity accounts last month. "By the end of the year, I expect to be about 80% in cash" in these accounts,
Mr. Kunkel says.
"I'm giving up 60 days of potential gain," he adds. "I may lose out on that end, but if we do have a major
correction, I have cash available for a buying opportunity."
Lawrence Astrove, a semi-retired former golf-course owner, started a lot earlier. In October of last year, Mr.
Astrove, who lives near Portland, Ore., told Marilyn Bergen, the financial adviser who manages his
mutual-fund holdings, to shift his weighting in stock funds to 20% from 80% of total assets. "We've lost a
couple thousand points," says Mr. Astrove, who continued to invest in individual stocks on his own. "In
retrospect, we shouldn't have done a thing with Marilyn's portion."
Ms. Wang of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter says that her firm doesn't "see Y2K causing a bear market. If there
are isolated disruptions, it could have some impact on the stock market for a couple of days or so," she adds.
"But because this is a temporary phenomenon, investors will look beyond that."
Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG, says that "for
most investors, the choice is to sell stocks now and share half the gains with the federal government or look
through the Y2K problem."
Mr. Yardeni, a noted Y2K bear, says he is no longer a Y2K "alarmist," though he still expects "a fairly intense,
but short recession." He says, "If investors don't think they can comfortably ride out the storm, the most
reasonable thing to do . . . is to talk to your broker and consider defensive strategies including buying puts to
protect your gains." A put is a contract that gives the holder the right, for a small fee, to sell shares at a preset
price up to a predetermined date.
But the best move people can make in anticipation of Y2K is to put their finances in order. From now through
the first two months of next year, they should save all brokerage-firm, bank and mutual-fund records and
check them against transaction records. They should also review mortgage and loan statements and
creditcard, utility and property tax bills.
If you do decide to load up on cash, be careful. Gale Hayman, the founder of Georgio Beverly Hills and Gale
Hayman Beverly Hills Cosmetics Inc., learned the risks of hoarding cash the hard way. In November, Ms.
Hayman told police that $15,000 that she had stashed away in preparation for Y2K had been stolen from an
unlocked safe in her apartment at New York's Pierre Hotel. Ms. Hayman, who had tucked about $5,000 in
each of three envelopes, discovered the theft when she went to put a fourth envelope in the safe.
"I wanted to prepare just in case there were any delays . . . for the same reason I didn't want to leave the
country and fly," says Ms. Hayman, who declined to discuss the details of the robbery. "Being of conservative
nature, I thought it was a good idea."

The Fed Should Tighten -- but for the Right Reasons
The Fed Should Tighten -- but for the Right Reasons
By Wayne Angell

21 December 1999

The Federal Open Market Committee has been doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. I have no
sympathy for the growth-limiting objectives inherent in Fed explanations of its actions over the past seven
months. Yet the FOMC has been correct in increasing the federal-funds rate to 5.5% from 4.75%. When it
meets today, the FOMC should announce a tightening bias consistent with a move to 5.75% during the first
quarter of 2000.
The FOMC has it all wrong in basing its actions on the notion that rapid economic growth along with low
unemployment causes inflation. A faster growth of output in a monetary environment determined by a
reluctant FOMC means more goods are being chased by the same amount of money. That is, money is made
scarce by an increase in output of goods and services, which is consistent with a rise in the demand for
money. Hence, the inflation rate falls.
Likewise, a drop in unemployment is apt to accelerate the growth rate of worker pay but not the rate of
inflation. If the FOMC does its job properly, then executives are acutely aware of their lack of pricing power.
If their primary focus is to maximize shareholder value, then the growth rate of labor compensation is limited
to the growth rate of labor productivity.
The problem with the FOMC's demand-management thinking is that monetary restraint to limit the growth of
demand will also limit the growth of the supply of goods and services. The Fed cannot manage to increase
the unemployment rate for workers without also increasing the "unemployment rate" for capital.
The U.S. advantage over most of the rest of the world is that as our unemployment rate falls, the social and
political cost of more blatant substitution of capital for labor nearly disappears. Rising wages become the
friend of lower inflation as the stock of capital goods rises faster than the growth rate of labor. Nonresidential
capital goods production, buildings and equipment, has risen to 14% of GDP from 9% in 1990.
As the ratio of capital inputs to labor inputs rises, labor productivity increases. Technological innovation spurs
more capital-goods production, which spurs further technological innovation. Thus it's foolish for the FOMC to
attempt to limit the growth rate of a productivity-led surge in output. An increase in labor productivity is sure
both to increase the real wage rate and to augment the wealth of the American people.
The FOMC's worries about low unemployment rates and rapid economic growth leads it to an even riskier
minefield -- worrying about the level of stock prices. The FOMC cannot succeed in halting the growth of stock
prices, just as it could not in the 1920s. The FOMC will never take the only action that would lower stock
prices: announce that it has gone soft on inflation. Instead, as the Fed applies its wrongheaded thinking on
raising rates to slow economic growth, market perception is of a vigilant Fed. And the market likes a vigilant
Fed. That's why announcing a tightening bias tomorrow isn't likely to dampen stock-market exuberance.
Trial-and-error attempts to slow economic growth and to dampen market enthusiasm will surely lower the rate
of inflation in 2000 and 2001. As long as gradual disinflation is evident, some good things happen: the
effective tax rate on capital gains falls; the cost-cutting zeal of business leaders is reinforced; the economic
expansion goes on and on. Stock prices respond by continuing to rise.
In the U.S. in 1929 and Japan in 1989, monetary conditions had gone quite beyond disinflation to deflation.
As the ad hoc Reserve Bank open-market committee raised rates to tame stock price appreciation, it
generated a 5% to 6% annual rate of decline in wholesale prices. Deflation can be powerful enough to ruin an
economy's productive potential. A stock-market crash while the economy is being ruined is another matter
altogether. A devastated economy with a crash in earnings and stock prices will always be dubbed a "bubble"
market after the fact.
Why, then, do I favor an increase in the federal-funds rate to 5.75% during the first quarter of next year? First,
the current inflation rate of 1.5% to 2% is not zero. Just as the FOMC enhanced growth by cutting inflation

--- Page 34 ---
Page 34 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
from its 3% to 4% range of 1993, the economy would derive further benefits by gradually cutting the inflation
rate in half again. I believe that FOMC actions count even when the FOMC fails to announce its intention. An
increase in the funds rate to 5.75% would likely lower inflation expectations, and the price of gold would
likely respond by moving back to a $250 to $280 range.
Second, Alan Greenspan is correct in suggesting that if the Fed is to err, it is preferable to err on the side of
restraint. The easiest task for a central bank is to create enough money to make money less valuable. The
FOMC was very effective -- maybe too effective -- in eliminating the commodity deflation that spilled over into
a real-estate deflation in 1985-86.
Third, the U.S. economy eventually may be plagued by the persistent undersaving rate. Capital investment
spending continues to grow more rapidly than national saving. As a result, real interest rates have been on a
persistent rise since February 1994. Objective measurement of real interest rate increases since the Treasury
started issuing inflation-indexed 10-year notes in January 1997 shows a real rate rise to 4.3% from 3.36%.
Given the current misguided income-tax system, real rates are likely to need to rise further, perhaps as high
as 5%.
If the FOMC can engineer a rise in real interest rates that is driven primarily by a decline in the inflation
rate, then all is well. On the other hand, if the energy-driven inflation rate hiccup in 1999 were not reversed,
then real interest rate increases would stem primarily from increases in nominal interest rates. That seems
to me a bad solution. Thereby, I favor a disinflationary step to 5.75% on the funds rate.
Fourth, I would prefer that this economic expansion continue. Surely we know that economic expansions end
when the FOMC makes an inflationary mistake, such as it did from October 1987 to March 1988. Pre-emptory
action by the FOMC is the best way to increase the length of the expansion. If the committee can get
inflation expectations to match the disinflationary track of the core consumer price index at 2%, rather than
permit slippage of expectations to 3%, the likely 12-month total increase to be shown by the total CPI at year
end, that would be a giant step.
Monetary policy has one priority that always produces good results: to target the price level properly. The
most practical forward indicators of price-level changes can still be found in commodity prices, including the
price of gold. While current commodity price indicators suggest the Fed is on a proper course of monetary
restraint consistent with a stable rate of inflation, I would prefer that the FOMC effectively reinforce the
gradual disinflationary track shown by the core CPI. My advice is to announce a tightening bias today to be
followed by a probable rate increase to 5.75% on Feb. 2, provided that commodity indicators need one more
nudge to ensure a disinflationary course.

Nasdaq's Gains Mask a House Divided;Stocks Show Equal Split of Rich and Poor
Abreast of the Market
Nasdaq's Gains Mask a House Divided; Stocks Show Equal Split of Rich and Poor

This is a tale of two stock markets -- two very different markets that both have the same name.
One, the happy one, is loaded with soaring technology stocks, some of them up 1,000% or more in 1999. The
other market, full of sad drug companies, manufacturers and financial firms, doesn't have a single gainer this
year. Its best stocks have gone nowhere; its worst are down 90%, having lost most of their worth.
The two markets, each containing almost the same number of stocks, are the two halves of the Nasdaq Stock
Market.
Taken as a whole, the Nasdaq Composite Index is up an astounding 71% since the year began, by far the
biggest gain in Nasdaq history, or, for that matter, in the history of just about any of the nation's stock
indexes.
But Nasdaq divides almost evenly into two distinct places, according to data provided by Birinyi Associates,
Westport, Conn. Half the market is up. In a year when many analysts bemoan the "narrowness" of the
market, a much wider group of stocks has soared through the roof this year than many people realize. A total
of 997 stocks, more than one Nasdaq stock in five, have at least doubled in price this year. Such huge, broad
gains are unheard of. Of the stocks that are up on Nasdaq, the average stock has more than doubled, gaining
151%.
And yet, despite such heady gains on one side of the market, nearly half of all Nasdaq's stocks have actually
fallen in price this year. Of the losers, the average decline is almost 32%.
"It really has been a case of the haves and the have-nots," says Sally Anderson, portfolio manager at Kopp
Investment Advisors, Edina, Minn.
Investors are selectively buying the stocks they think will hold up in the face of rising interest rates and
stiffening business competition. In many cases, that means tech stocks. Some of the winners are thought to
be so competitive they can post big-time earnings, or at least strong revenue growth, no matter what. But
many of the winners -- around 47 of the 100 biggest gainers on Nasdaq, in fact -- aren't just tech companies,
they are closely linked to the Internet. Many of them aren't expected to show any profits at all for the
foreseeable future. For that select bunch, investors don't mind. They believe, rightly or wrongly, these stocks
will be part of the growing revolution in information technology and communications, and they want to own a
piece of the revolution.
The stocks that aren't part of the revolution, that have failed to deliver on promises or that are having trouble
boosting prices and profits in the face of cutthroat competition? No one wants them, not even if they are
cheap. And they are getting hammered. Without the tech winners, the Nasdaq market shows little if any gain.
"There is a whole group of stocks that are just lying there and not doing anything," Ms. Anderson says. "And it
is my impression that the common denominator is earnings growth. Most of those that are down have shown
disappointing fundamentals. If they have any growth it is only modest growth."
Skeptics shake their heads with worry that the gains represent an enormous bubble, which will leave
devastation behind when it bursts. And investors are ignoring the skeptics.
The astounding gains continued on Friday. With a surge of 38 points, or 1.02%, the Nasdaq composite hit
3753.06, its 25th record close in the past 35 trading days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose 23%
annual gain would look huge in any other year, flirted with a record but fell back. It rose 12.54 points, or
0.11%, to 11257.43, leaving it just 68.61 points short of a record. But that represented a gain of just 32.73
points, or 0.29%, for the week. The Nasdaq composite, by contrast, was up close to 4% last week.

--- Page 36 ---

But seldom has a strong market had so many losers. The biggest single characteristic separating the winners
from the losers: the technology label. Of the 2,440 Nasdaq gainers, 46%, almost half, are in the tech
business. Of the 2,254 Nasdaq losers, less than 16% are tech. Of course, some troubled, small software and
computer companies do show up among the big losers. But none is a well-known name. The 10 biggest
losers don't include a single tech company; they all are in areas such as health care, retailing and
manufacturing.
Among the 200 worst-performing stocks, 29, or 15%, are tech companies -- little surprise given the huge
presence of tech names in that stock market. But the bottom 200 performers contain more drug and
health-care companies (36) and also more manufacturing stocks (31), a clear reflection of where investors
have preferred to have their money.
The winners have done so well that some well-known stocks, whose big gains have made them media
heroes, look almost like also-rans. Network-equipment company Cisco Systems, which to many people
symbolizes the market's strength, has been outperformed by more than 900 Nasdaq stocks this year; it has
doubled in value, and yet is only 906 on the list of Nasdaq gainers. Microsoft, up more than 66% this year,
has been on fire, and yet it actually trails the 71% overall advance of the Nasdaq index. It trails the median
change for all tech stocks on Nasdaq, which is a gain of 74%. Microsoft is only No. 1,250 on the list of
gainers.
"What people have been saying to me is that it is really just seven stocks that are driving the market, and that
if you don't own Cisco and Oracle and Dell Computer, you are nowhere. But that clearly isn't the case," says
Laszlo Birinyi, of Birinyi Associates.
Who does lead the list? A billon-dollar company called Puma Technology, which makes
wireless-communications software, and which is up 2,350%. The best-known names at the top: Red Hat, the
hot Linux software maker, up 1,700%, and Qualcomm, the cell-phone technology company, up 1,650%. Only
one of the top 10, Modern Medical Modalities, in the magnetic-resonance-imaging business, still is tiny. All 10
are tech or tech-related.
Some analysts believe the Nasdaq rocket ship could peak out early in the year. With the winners up so much,
many investors hesitate to sell them and take profits in the current tax year, preferring to postpone
capital-gains taxes. But in January, those holding the stocks for tax reasons will be able to sell.
But many investors insist they won't be selling their big tech holdings. Donald Berdine, chief investment
officer of PNC Advisors in Pittsburgh, part of PNC Bank, says as much as 45% of his group's small-stock
portfolio is in tech stocks, and a large hunk of his big-cap portfolio is there too. The technology revolution, he
says, "will undoubtedly be bigger than we think."
Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn points out, over the past five years, Commerce Department figures
show tech companies accounted for 6% of the nation's economic production capacity, but 35% of economic
growth. Little wonder they have been showing the profits, the revenue growth and the stock-market gains.
Can some of the losers finally rebound in the new year?
"A lot will depend on the overall growth we see in the economy," Ms. Anderson says. "Because if we don't
see growth coming back to some of these areas that haven't been doing well, I don't know what gets them off
their bottoms."

Friday Market Activity
Blue-chip stocks gave back most of their big intraday gains but managed to finish modestly higher.
New York Stock Exchange volume hit a record 1.35 billion shares on Friday, an unprecedented fourth
consecutive day with more than one billion shares trading. The activity was partly the product of "triple
witching" Friday, marking the quarterly expiration of stock options, index options and futures.
General Electric jumped 4 1/4 to 151 3/4, hitting a 52-week high of 154 3/4 intraday. The Fairfield, Conn.,
company said it is splitting its stock 3-for-1, raising its dividend 17%, and increasing its share repurchase
program to $22 billion from $17 billion.
J.P. Morgan fell 13/16 to 128 1/16. Concern earlier in the session was that the company wouldn't meet
fourth-quarter earnings expectations, but analysts said those worries were probably unfounded. American
Express gained 2 1/2 to 155 1/8, Citigroup tacked on 5/8 to 54 1/2, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter improved 3
to 128 and PaineWebber gained 1 to 37 3/16.

Tandy fell 13 5/8, or 21%, to 52 3/8. Radio Shack, a unit of the Fort Worth, Texas, consumer-electronics
company, said its same-store sales growth in the first half of December was slightly below the monthly goal of
an 8% to 10% increase. But Radio Shack also said 55% to 60% of December sales have historically occurred
in the second half of the month, and said the week after Christmas is important.
Adobe (Nasdaq) improved 3 3/4, or 5.9%, to 67 1/2. Late Thursday, the company posted fourth-quarter
operating results of 46 cents a share, topping the consensus view of 42 cents. Adobe is a San Jose, Calif.,
maker of Web publishing and document-viewing software.
Nike jumped 8 3/4, or 20%, to 52 7/16. The Beaverton, Ore., shoe and apparel company earned 38 cents a
share in its fiscal second quarter, compared with operating net of 28 cents a year ago and 4 cents ahead of
expectations.
Alza fell 4, or 10.6%, to 32 7/16. After the close on Thursday, Abbott Laboratories said it won't be able to
complete its planned $7.3 billion merger with Alza, as the pharmaceutical companies weren't able to come to
terms with the Federal Trade Commission to satisfy concerns relating to the merger. In primary trading
Friday, Abbott tacked on 1 1/8 to 37 7/16. In after-hours composite trading on Thursday, Alza fell 11 7/8 to 27
3/4 and Abbott improved 4 5/16 to 38 1/8.
Anglogold improved 1 3/16 to 25 5/16. The gold-mining company, based in South Africa, said it has gained
acceptance amounting to more than 58% of the share capital of Acacia, up from less than 25% about three
weeks ago. Anglogold is offering 3.5 of its shares for every 100 shares of Acacia, Australia's fifth-largest gold
miner.
Monsanto gained 1 3/8, or 3.4%, to 41 3/4. The Wall Street Journal reported Pharmacia & Upjohn is in
merger talks with the St. Louis company. Shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn fell 2 5/8, or 5%, to 50 3/8.
Circuit City fell 15/16, or 2.3%, to 41 5/8. The company posted third-quarter income from continuing
operations of 27 cents a share, compared with the First Call estimate of 26 cents. Circuit City is a
consumer-electronics retailer based in Richmond, Va.
With stocks in the midst of what is typically the strongest part of the year, analysts said equities should
continue to perform well.
"It's very hard for the market to go down in November, December and January," said Brian Belski, chief
investment strategist at George K. Baum. "The opportunity cost of turning bearish at this time is too high."
Surely, the market is going to run into some speed bumps along the way, especially with some of the
valuations being placed on stocks in certain segments of the technology sector. But it is that sector in which
investors should see the best returns over the long haul.
"Major technological revolutions are always bigger than anyone ever thinks," said Ed Kerschner, chief
strategist at PaineWebber Inc., in a research note. "The ongoing U.S. [gross domestic product] shift will see
the virtual disappearance of the agriculture, mining and construction sectors, the continued shrinkage of the
manufacturing sector and further growth in the service sector."
While investors might be right in worrying short term about the level of major indexes, Mr. Kerschner said the
sizable household money flows into stocks should continue for at least another 10 to 15 years, helping prop
up the market over that time.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said new home sales fell 2.3% in November, an unexpected
slowdown. The data could be evidence the three interest-rate increases this year are starting to impact the
U.S. economy. Whether it is enough to stop the Federal Reserve from raising rates in early February is
another matter.

CONGRESS EXTENDS a law helping workers pay for education expenses.
Part of a bill that President Clinton is expected to sign this week will benefit more than 800,000 workers
whose employers help them pay for their education costs. The legislation will extend a provision through Dec.
31, 2001, allowing a worker to receive as much as $5,250 each year in tax-free tuition assistance. This
provision was set to expire for courses beginning after May 31, 2000.
But House and Senate conferees decided to limit the exclusion once again to undergraduate courses,
rejecting proposals to expand it to graduate-level studies. The exclusion expired for graduate courses in
mid-1996. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer strongly opposes including graduate
courses. "Chairman Archer feels that future doctors, lawyers and corporate executives don't need tax breaks
for education," says Trent Duffy, an aide to the Texas Republican.
Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this extension will cost the Treasury about $584 million.
LAWMAKERS TARGET a tax dodge used mainly by high-income investors.
Another part of the bill awaiting Clinton's signature is designed to prevent investors from cutting taxes on
income from hedge funds, which are loosely regulated investment partnerships, and similar types of
investments. In a typical transaction, instead of investing directly in a fund, an investor buys a derivative
whose return is tied to the fund's performance. This "constructive ownership transaction" effectively converts
ordinary income or short-term capital gains into long-term capital gains taxed at much lower rates.
The measure will raise an estimated $517 million over the decade, says the Joint Committee on Taxation.
The measure applies to transactions entered into after July 11, 1999. The bill "is important as a fairness
issue, but even more so as a first step to reduce tax avoidance through the use of derivatives," says Rep.
Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat.
MANY PEOPLE pass up a simple tax-saving technique, a report says. Surprisingly few people are taking
advantage of a tax-law provision that allows them to give away as much as $10,000 a year, tax-free, to a
child or anyone else. This conclusion emerges from a study by James M. Poterba of MIT and the National
Bureau of Economic Research. He says nearly two-thirds of elderly households for whom the estate tax may
loom as a potential burden aren't making these gifts.
Mr. Poterba offers several possible explanations. The most obvious is that many older people fear they will
need all their money. People also may worry their children won't make good use of the gifts. Another theory,
he says, is that many wealthy people think the tax laws may be overhauled in coming years.
The $10,000-a-year threshold is indexed for inflation but will remain unchanged next year.
NEW TROIKA: Carol Gold heads the employee-plans unit of the IRS's new tax-exempt and
government-entities division. Steve Miller runs the exempt-organizations unit, and Ed Weiler is director of the
new government-entities area.
THE SUPREME COURT declined to hear a man's appeal that he doesn't owe taxes on "religious, moral and
conscientious grounds." The man also had insisted he shouldn't have to pay taxes because the government
is corrupt and unjust. A lower court labeled these arguments "frivolous" and ordered him to pay $2,000 in
costs and attorney's fees.
SALES AND USE TAXES generate about 25% of all state and local tax revenues, says Harley Duncan,
executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators in Washington. That is up from about 20% two
decades earlier.

STATES ENJOY another year of bulging tax coffers. State tax revenues grew 5.7% in fiscal 1999 over 1998,
says the Center for the Study of the States at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany,
N.Y. That was slightly slower than in the two prior years. But it was "still quite strong," especially since many
states cut taxes, says Elizabeth I. Davis, senior policy analyst.
California posted the largest tax cut in total dollars, Ms. Davis says. But many states had bigger cuts in
percentage terms, such as Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. Personal-income tax revenues jumped 8.1%, sales-tax
revenues increased 6.2% and corporate-income tax revenues edged up 0.7%.
"Barring any major economic shocks, the next legislative session will produce another crop of tax cuts," Ms.
Davis says.
BRIEFS: The top 25% of taxpayers, ranked by income, made 65% of total 1997 adjusted gross income and
paid about 82% of total federal individual income taxes, says a Tax Foundation report based on IRS data. . . .
Rep. Pete Stark, who voted against the tax bill awaiting Clinton's signature, calls the "Ticket to Work and
Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999" a gross misnomer: "This title would never pass the `truth in
labeling' test if it were on a box of food, but you can still get away with such falsehoods here in Congress --
especially in the waning hours of the session."

Anyone bold enough to try predicting what will happen to stocks in the next decade ought first to look back at
what smart people in 1989 were expecting for the '90s.
Japan's market still was seen as a miracle -- although it was a bubble about to burst. The U.S. was standing
on the doorstep of its greatest bull market of the century, but the operative word among U.S. investors was
angst.
"In 1989, many people were extremely nervous -- nervous about the economy and nervous about the
markets," recalls stockmarket bull Abby Joseph Cohen, now of Goldman Sachs, then of Drexel Burnham
Lambert.
Deutsche Bank Securities investment strategist Ed Yardeni was predicting Dow 5000 within the next few
years, and was being laughed at. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 2753.20 as 1989 ended,
investors, still scarred by the 1987 crash, were debating whether it would get to 3000.
The transformation of the U.S. stock market since then has been profound. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average has more than quadrupled, the first time it has gained that much in any decade. The hot Nasdaq
Composite Index has multiplied in value almost eight times, rising to 3620.24 from 454.82 at the end of 1979.
A new lineup of dazzling stocks has created a breathless stock-market psychology that hasn't been seen
since the '60s, or perhaps the '20s. Many stars of the '80s -- Hasbro, Dillards, Liz Claiborne, Limited -- have
fizzled. This decade's stars cater to technologies, most obviously the Internet, that barely existed when the
decade began.
One obvious conclusion: In the new millennium's first decade, the big story could well be one that almost no
one has noticed yet.
As the old millennium ends with remarkably strong stock-index performance, bears warn that there isn't any
guarantee that the bubble won't burst in the new decade.
Of the 10 biggest stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Ned Davis Research, the
biggest gainer during the '80s was a company that has since fallen under a cloud -- cigarette-maker Philip
Morris, whose share price multiplied nine-fold in 10 years.
Today, that advance looks puny. A share of America Online, the top performer among the big 10 stocks of the
'90s, has multiplied in value almost 800 times during the decade (on a split-adjusted basis), for a gain of
almost 80,000%. Microsoft has seen its price multiply 70 times over, a gain of more than 7,000%. Philip
Morris's stock, meanwhile, rose just 85% in the decade, far less than many Internet initial stock offerings rise
on their first trading day.
Tech stocks dominate the lists of the decade's strongest stocks. The top-performing financial stock of the
'90s? Charles Schwab, the bellwether of online trading. The biggest gainer of all major stocks? America
Online, followed by Dell Computer.
As the decade draws to a close, technology-oriented individual investors, many of them trading online and
cruising the Internet for ideas, have begun to play a role in the market that rivals that of the pros. The
hot-trading individuals send Internet-related initial public stock-offerings soaring. Although some pros worry
that Internet-related stocks are forming a giant bubble, and while most ordinary, non-tech stocks have been
declining in value, the major indexes are continuing to rise, due in large part to a few hot tech stocks.

Of 12 stocks recommended at the end of 1989 by four experts quoted in the Wall Street Journal, three were
gold companies -- a defensive investment if there ever was one. Most of the 12 have trailed the market
during the decade; the gold stocks actually have lost value. Among today's most actively traded stocks, a
surprising number weren't even publicly listed in 1989: Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, America Online, Qualcomm,
MCI WorldCom.
Four stocks gained at least 1,000% in both decades: Home Depot, up 5,000% in the '80s and 3,000% in the
'90s; Wal-Mart Stores, up 4,000% in the '80s and 1,000% in the '90s; Gap, up 3,700% in the '80s and 2,300%
in the '90s; and Computer Associates International, up 1,300% in the '80s and 1,600% in the '90s.
The shift in the basic ways that investors view the market may have been as important as the magnitude of
the gains. Fundamental research is out of fashion; simply chasing whatever is hot, which is delicately referred
to as "momentum investing" and was considered a goofy idea a decade ago, is in.
"Investment models have simply changed enormously in the past 10 years," says Henry Herrmann, chief
investment officer at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan.
At a meeting with West Coast customers early this year, he scoffed at a question by one young man who
wondered if one of the group's hot funds, for small technology stocks, could match its 60% gain in 1998. So
far, he notes, the fund is doing even better this year than last.
Expectations are through the roof. "People are borrowing money on their houses to invest in stocks, and in
1989 you didn't see any of that," Mr. Herrmann says. "People trying to adopt a rational view these days are
viewed as Cassandras."
Almost no analysts in the '80s foresaw the stock bonanza of the '90s, Mr. Herrmann notes, but a few did
accurately identify the changes that were under way: productivity gains, new technologies, rising profits,
falling inflation and lower interest rates. Among the most accurate, he says, were Mr. Yardeni of Deutsche
Bank and PaineWebber investment strategist Edward Kerschner.
Goldman Sachs's Ms. Cohen, who accurately predicted a 1990 bear market, soon began issuing similarly
bullish reports. "Our numbers, our models, were telling me in the early part of decade that the S&P 500 was
as much as 50% undervalued," she recalls.
Can the gains continue?
Ms. Cohen and Mr. Kerschner now consider that major stock indexes have little hope of continuing their
strings of 20% annual gains. They have achieved fair value. Future advances, these analysts say, will come
from rises in corporate earnings. That means index gains could revert to their past average of a bit more than
7% a year.
For Mr. Kerschner, that means the Dow industrials aren't likely to be much higher than 12500 at the end of
next year, up perhaps 12% from here. But, he adds, if you compound 7% gains over the next decade, you still
wind up at Dow 25000 in 2010.
Perhaps more important than that, he and others now believe that the stock market's basic nature may have
changed, making bear markets less frequent and less severe.
In this view, the business cycle itself has been modified, with more emphasis on information technology and
less on boombust swings. In the first 40 years after World War II, Mr. Kerschner notes, the U.S. suffered a
recession every 4.6 years, on average. "Now, we have had just one in 18 years. You just aren't going to get
the big bear markets that were typical of an industrial age, with big inventories and boom-bust cycles."
Ms. Cohen is starting to think that this could be a good time to put money in economies that are going to
benefit from the trends that helped the U.S. in the '90s.
"Europe looks like the U.S. at end of 1980s," she says. "There are wonderful opportunities," but because
more work still must be done "on profitability and on cost cutting, outsiders can't see it all" yet.
As for Mr. Yardeni, the former raging bull now considers the market wildly overvalued. He has become
well-known for his warning that a jolt such as the year-2000 computer glitch could throw us into a recession
and a bear market. And then? He expects another big bull market, with Dow 15000 in 2005.
Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber, notes that investors have gone from
fearing in 1987 that the overall investment system couldn't continue to work, to thinking in 1999 that stocks
have nowhere to go but up.

People "are almost ready to throw in the towel now and say they are going up forever," he says. "We thought
that Microsoft's 10-year move was dynamic, and some of these Internet stocks are doing it in 10 weeks. If you
can honestly say you predicted that, then I tip my hat to you."

Money: The Century's Agony

STOCKHOLM -- A Nobel Prize is scarcely an invitation to modesty, least of all with the turn of a millennium
only weeks away. So Robert Mundell, the 1999 laureate in economics, took as his memorial lecture subject
"A Reconsideration of the Twentieth Century."
The point is that the economic dislocations of the century, and the political dislocations they produced or
advanced, flowed from ill-understood perturbations in international economics. In particular, the 20th century
began with a highly efficient international monetary mechanism operating smoothly to facilitate trade and
capital movements, but the traditional gold standard broke down with World War I. After confusions such as
the Depression of the 1930s and inflation of the 1970s, the century is closing with efforts to re-establish
some of the principles once applied through the use of gold. It has evolved "three islands of monetary
stability," the dollar, the euro and the yen, but "exchange rates between them will be the source of greatest
disturbances to the international monetary system."
The Mundellian view is familiar enough to readers who follow this newspaper's commentary and editorial
opinions. In addition to his own articles, such as his series on the advent of the euro last year, he's been the
intellectual fountainhead of many of the economic ideas advanced in our editorials over the past two
decades. He has been a champion not only of exchange rate stability but of the supply-side policy mix that
allowed the Reagan administration to subdue the stagflation it inherited in 1981. The then-heterodox idea of
fighting inflation with tight monetary policy and fighting stagnation with incentive-directed tax cuts has its
roots in his seminal 1960s work on international economics cited by the Nobel committee.
"The main thing we miss today is a universal money," Mr. Mundell told his audience here, a "standard of
value, the link between the past and the future and the cement of civilization linking remote parts of the
human race to one another." From the time of Augustus until 1914, this role was filled by gold; "currencies
were just names for particular weights of gold." So "the absence of gold as an intrinsic part of our monetary
system today makes our century, the one that has just passed, unique in several thousand years."
The gold standard worked not by magic or divine ordinance, but because of intellectual principles that are
reasonably well understood, especially after the body of work celebrated with this week's Nobel award. Gold
was at least part of the base for national money, so that if a nation lost gold its money supply would contract,
automatically correcting depreciation of its currency. Thus the standard was a "self-regulating rudder that
guided policy makers toward equilibrium." Exchange rates were predictable, though the inflation rate shared
by all nations was sometimes influenced by accidents such as new gold discoveries, or nations leaving the
gold standard, usually because of war, or returning to it afterward.
These effects struck with vengeance in World War I. Wartime deficit financing forced the belligerents off gold.
Much of their gold was then exported to the U.S., swelling its money supply; the U.S. price level doubled
during the war, and while the Federal Reserve reversed some of the inflation, the price level remained 35%
above prewar levels through most of the 1920s.
Germany broke its hyperinflation by establishing the reichsmark at a level appropriate to the dollar but 40%
overvalued against prewar gold. Britain then returned to gold at the prewar parity. France and other
countries generally also returned to gold. This created a huge demand for gold, and thus a powerful
deflationary force around the world, leading to the Great Depression.
A few economists understood. French economist Charles Rist had enough influence that his nation did not go
back to the prewar gold parity and escaped the worst of the downturn. Ludwig von Mises warned that
restoration of gold would bring deflation. After gold was restored Gustav Cassel of Sweden wrote of the
need to restrict monetary demand for it "to prevent a permanent fall of the general price level and a prolonged
and world-wide depression which would inevitably be connected with such a fall in prices." After all, this is
how the gold standard always worked -- correcting a period of inflation with a period of deflation.

--- Page 45 ---
Page 45 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
In the interwar period, the economic, political and intellectual price of the deflation proved intolerable. The
deflationary pressure led to the 1929 stock market crash, "sparked off by news that the notorious
Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which raised tariffs to levels unprecedented in over a century, would probably pass
Congress." General deflation was compounded by the implosion of trade and credit and the collapse of
sterling in 1931. By 1934 "the world depression had deepened, economic nationalism was on the march, and
the disease of totalitarianism had spread over most of the European continent."
These events might have been averted by a devaluation of the dollar, and thus currencies generally, against
gold. Instead of forcing the world economy to adjust to the prewar price level, that is, the answer was to
accept the wartime inflation and then continue with the automatic international discipline of the gold
standard. But almost no one thought of this; though the Roosevelt administration did float against gold and
then come back at a higher price, it prohibited citizens from even holding gold. Intellectually, "economists
blamed the gold standard instead of their mishandling of it and turned away from international automaticity to
national macroeconomic management."
Though John Maynard Keynes had warned of depression as early as 1928, publication of his "General
Theory" in 1936 offered prescriptions for management of a closed economy, oblivious to the impact of
international monetary events. Meanwhile, the world evolved what is known as the Bretton Woods system,
under which other currencies were fixed to the dollar and the U.S. would redeem their dollars in gold at $35
an ounce. This implied use of U.S. domestic monetary policy to stabilize gold at that price, a discipline that
the U.S. never accepted and that its huge stores of gold allowed it to ignore while it pursued internal
macroeconomic policies. When the Federal Reserve lost gold, it "sterilized" the contraction of the money
supply by buying an equivalent amount of government bonds.
In its monetary impact, World War II replayed World War I. The price level doubled, and gold became scarce
at $35 an ounce. "The stability in the world economy required increases in international reserves more or less
pari passu with the growth of income and trade"; but there was not enough gold to go around. This time,
however, policy makers did not repeat the mistake of the 1920s; instead, they made the opposite one. On
Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon took the world monetary system off gold, ushering in a system of generalized
floating exchange rates.
This proved to be an engine of world inflation, since domestic inflation in any country was not subject to
international discipline. Also, financial speculation could move exchange rates, "leading to wasteful
misallocation of resources as resources are shifted from the international to the domestic sector and back
again." For small countries, speculation could destabilize exchange markets entirely.
To reduce the "chaos of a completely decentralized system," the world has now gravitated toward currency
areas, with smaller states fixing their currencies to larger neighbors -- the dollar, the euro, the yen and, in the
case of parts of Africa, the French franc. Economic growth resumed in the U.S. and the world generally with
the Reagan supply-side policies. Even with a nine-month recession in 1990, since 1982 the U.S. has
experienced "one of the greatest expansions in the history of any country." Around the world, other nations
gradually "began to rediscover the policies that made the gold standard work and by the turn of the century,
had brought inflation under control."
So at the turn of the millennium, the world economy enjoys good growth and low inflation. But the danger
sign on the horizon is the instability of exchange rates among the three big currencies. "It would be a grave
mistake to believe that the closed nature of the three big blocs would make exchange rates less important or
that the dollar-euro rate can be treated with `benign neglect.'" Central bankers should not feel free to continue
the pursuit of domestic objectives oblivious to the international sector, as the Federal Reserve in particular
usually has.
A final theme in the Mundell lecture here was that an international monetary system "is governed in large part
by the power configurations of nations." And that "the most important fact of the twentieth century was the
rise to superpower status and even hegemony of the United States." The concluding words of his lecture
were these: "It remains for the next century to see whether a restoration of the international monetary system
is compatible with the power configuration of the world economy."
Obviously this is a plea for U.S. leadership in forging a new system to contain the threat of instability among
the leading currency blocs. And if a visiting journalist can be allowed an elaboration: There is no trace of such
leadership as the U.S. prepares to elect a new president. The discussion among the candidates, and among
the U.S. elites in general, shows no sign of understanding the impact of international monetary events, let
alone of devising initiatives to contain them.

I disagree with the details of the monetary policy analysis laid out in the Nov. 19 Americas column "In
Mexico, Too Much Money Still Chases Too Few Goods." Jim Dorn argues that Mexico's fast money-supply
growth is causing inflation. He concludes that the central bank should "bind itself to a monetary rule that
limits the quantity of money to a noninflationary growth rate" or else allow Mexicans to use other currencies.
I agree that Mexicans deserve to use a meaningful currency and that inflation at more than 12% in 1999 is
too high. It is true that Mexico's money supply has been growing fast. Monetary base grew 27.5% in the 12
months through September 1999, well above Mexico's nominal GDP growth.
However, I disagree that fast money-supply growth in 1999 is causing the 1999 inflation. Mexico's 1999
inflation is the result of peso weakness in early 1998. The peso held steady at 8 per dollar in 1996 and 1997,
causing inflation to fall rapidly. In 1998, the peso was allowed to weaken 20% to 10 per dollar. Gold and
commodity prices in Mexico increased even while they were falling in most other currencies. As a result of
peso weakness, inflation rose and peaked at 19% in the 12 months through January 1999. Money-supply
growth was relatively stable throughout this period and does not explain the changes in the inflation rate. (In
1996 and 1997, monetary base grew 26% and 29% per year yet inflation fell rapidly. Money growth slowed
somewhat in 1998 and 1999, yet inflation rose.)
I don't think money-supply growth is a proper target for monetary policy. The demand for money changes
drastically based on the public's expectations about the future value of the currency. Fast money
supply-growth is normal and noninflationary when a country is building confidence in itself and its currency. If
Mexico had limited the growth in money supply in 1996 and 1997, it would have choked off its economic
recovery. With the peso now strong at 9.3 per dollar, inflation is falling rapidly.
Mexico's money-supply growth should be regulated based on the value of the peso and the demand for
money, not an arbitrary money-growth target. If the peso weakens, as it did in 1998, its value should be
promptly restored by reducing the monetary base. Mexico's process of achieving low inflation and fast
growth could be accelerated through a declaration of a stable peso policy, a tax rate cut, deregulation, and a
new focus on productivity and competition.

Gold Rises on Bargain Hunting, Short Covering

Gold Rises on Bargain Hunting, Short Covering

NEW YORK -- Gold prices leapt after previous sell-offs encouraged demand, analysts said.
The market, which has suffered since a poorly received gold auction by the United Kingdom on Nov. 29,
slipped to a 10-week low Monday after the Dutch central bank said it would sell some of its gold reserves.
Bargain hunters in Asia jumped in overnight to take advantage of the weaker prices, forcing shorts -- or
traders who sold futures in expectation of lower prices -- to cover their positions by purchasing an equivalent
number of futures.
The active February gold future on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange surged $7.20
to $285.40 a troy ounce, more than recouping Monday's $3.90 decline.
"Any time you flirt with these lows, people get interested [in buying metal]," said George Gero, first vice
president with Prudential Securities in New York.
A precious-metals trader in New York agreed, noting that, with the losses since the U.K. auction, "a $20
savings is roughly what these guys were getting."
He added that "the weak dollar against the yen helped."
A weaker U.S. dollar makes gold, which is traded in dollars, cheaper to buy. A strong dollar in recent weeks
has hindered demand for gold, according to analysts.
Analysts said the market overreacted to the Dutch central bank's plan to sell 100 metric tons of gold next
year and another 200 metric tons during the next five years. A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds.
"It's really not that significant," said William O'Neill, chief futures strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York.
Indeed, the sale was part of a previously announced plan, in which 15 European central banks intend to limit
their gold sales to a total of 2,000 tons during the next five years.
The Dutch announcement "was old news," said Prudential's Mr. Gero. "When the shorts realized it, they
covered. They overreacted [Monday], and the market got into what we call an oversold condition."
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders booked profits ahead of the
release of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report. The January contract dropped 44 cents
to $26.22 a barrel. Traders said the market was vulnerable to bearish news after January crude gained more
than $2 a barrel in the prior four sessions.

NEW YORK -- Gold prices fell after the Dutch central bank said it intends to sell 300 metric tons of its gold
reserves during the next five years.
The Dutch announcement added to the gloomy tone in the gold market, which has been on a steep
downward curve since a poorly received Bank of England gold auction Nov. 29.
The active February gold contract on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange slid $3.90 to
$278.20 a troy ounce, following declines of more than $12 an ounce last week.
"Obviously, the news from the Dutch central bank has reopened some of the old wounds in the bullion
market," said James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc., a New York brokerage house.
Mr. Steel was referring to the overhang of official-sector sales, which helped pressure the price of gold to a
series of 20-year lows this summer.
The Nederlandsche Bank announced it will sell 100 metric tons initially and an additional 200 metric tons
during the next five years. After the sales are completed, the Netherlands' gold reserves will total 700 metric
tons. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
Unlike the United Kingdom, which in May announced it will sell more than half its gold reserves in a series of
auctions, the Netherlands won't announce each sale beforehand.
"We need to anticipate that they could start selling into any kind of rally," said Dave Meger, senior metals
analyst with Alaron Trading in Chicago.
The Dutch announcement shouldn't be a surprise to the market. The sales are part of the plan of the 15
European central banks to limit their total gold sales to 2,000 tons during the next five years and to freeze
gold-lending levels, market observers said.
That plan, announced Sept. 26, helped fuel a sharp rally in the price of gold. Since then, however, the gold
market, including futures, has suffered from poor demand for physical gold, underscored by the significantly
fewer-than-expected bids at last week's U.K. auction, market observers said.
"I think a lot of people are asking themselves: 'Why should we hold on to it if nobody wants it?,' " said one
precious metals trader. "Central banks don't want to own gold. They might try to support the price with a
quasibullish statement from time to time. It's in their interest to help the price."
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures rallied at Nymex, as the market priced in another week of absent Iraqi supplies and a
temporary pipeline stoppage between Louisiana and Illinois. The January crude-oil contract rose 85 cents to
$26.66 a barrel. On Friday, Iraq rejected the United Nations' one-week extension of the humanitarian
oil-for-food deal, under which all Iraqi oil is sold, keeping Iraq out of the market for at least another week.
"That supply is being kept out of the market at a time when we can least afford not to have it," said Andrew
LeBow, senior vice president for energy at ED&F Man in New York
COFFEE: Prices fell on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade
because of heavier-than-expected weekend rainfall in Brazil, traders said. The March contract dropped 9.50
cents to $1.3455 a pound. Prices rallied sharply last week because of concerns Brazil's crop has been
damaged by recent dry weather.

White House Plans to ProposeChanges in IMF Lending Policy
White House Plans to Propose Changes in IMF Lending Policy

RIO DE JANEIRO -- With the International Monetary Fund under attack in Congress, the Clinton
administration plans to propose significant changes in the way the international lender does business.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is expected to call on the IMF to focus more on emergency lending
than on helping ailing economies through long-term revolving loans. He expects to begin making his views
public in time for them to be discussed in Berlin on Dec. 16 at the inaugural meeting of the so-called Group of
20, a new international forum for discussing global economic issues. IMF member countries still would have
to approve any such reforms.
The administration believes this is a propitious time to take a new look at the IMF. The financial crisis that
swept the world over the past 2 1/2 years has largely dissipated, and IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus, who led the fund's response to that crisis, has announced his intention to step aside for a
still-unnamed successor.
"I've said many times the IMF is indispensable, but that doesn't mean we have to be satisfied with the one we
have," Mr. Summers said in an interview during a visit Friday to Brazil.
The move could help quiet criticism of the IMF on Capitol Hill, where Mr. Clinton had a rough time winning
approval this fall for the IMF to use its gold holdings to fund debt forgiveness for poor countries. Some
lawmakers and GOP presidential candidates have even called for a complete cutoff of U.S. funding for the
IMF, which is owned by 182 member countries and provides loans and economic advice to countries in
financial trouble.
Mr. Summers swapped views on the issues in private meetings last week with the economic team of
Argentine Presidentelect Fernando de la Rua in Buenos Aires, and in Rio with Brazilian Finance Minister
Pedro Malan and Central Bank President Arminio Fraga. Both countries are members of the G-20, created in
the wake of the financial crisis to give rich countries and major developing nations a place for informal debate
of global economic issues.
Beyond the Berlin G-20 meeting, the U.S. hopes Mr. Summers's ideas will help guide the continuing
campaign to redesign the world financial system to prevent and shorten future crises. As its major donor, the
U.S. has enormous influence in the way the IMF is run.
The Treasury Department hasn't released details of the plan. But Mr. Summers is likely to suggest that IMF
members consider focusing its lending more on emergency situations, such as recent crises in Thailand,
Ecuador and Brazil in recent years, rather than on recurrent loans to troubled economies, which U.S. officials
believe is better left to the World Bank.
Mr. Summers may also propose that the IMF streamline the kinds of loan programs it offers. The IMF
currently has a variety of packages, including financing to help countries adjust to commodity-price shocks
and to promote longer-term development, also the World Bank's home turf.
Mr. Summers also would like the IMF to take on a greater role in monitoring -- and making sure that private
investors are able to monitor -- countries' foreign obligations. That would be part of a larger discussion in the
G-20 of what the U.S. sees as a major cause of the recent global crisis: when countries face short-term debts
coming due that far exceed their foreign-currency reserves. Such a situation leaves them vulnerable to the
kind of financial chaos that struck East Asia in 1997, then moved through Russia and here to Brazil.
Developing countries traditionally assess their foreign-currency reserves in terms of how many months of
imports they will pay for. But, as South Korea and other countries learned to their despair, reserves can be
drained quickly if debts come due and investors lose confidence in the economy and the currency.

--- Page 52 ---

The IMF and developing nations, U.S policy makers feel, should judge the adequacy of a country's foreign
reserves by taking into account not just how much the government owes overseas, but also the foreign debts
of its banks and businesses, and the dollars the government has committed on the futures market. Countries,
they say, should assess their vulnerability by working through what might happen if, for instance, the price of
a critical export product -- such as oil or coffee -- were to drop.
One idea, proposed some months ago by Argentine Deputy Finance Minister Pablo Guidotti, is that countries
should keep enough reserves so that they could go a full year without having to borrow on international
markets.
Separately, IMF officials say they won't approve a $640 million loan installment for Russia -- already delayed
for several months -- until Moscow makes further progress on economic reforms. Mr. Camdessus met Friday
in Washington with Russia's envoy to the large industrialized nations and reviewed the steps the IMF requires
before it will release the second installment on a $4.5 billion loan.

NEW YORK -- Gold prices plunged Friday, following the release of a benign U.S. employment report, which
calmed investor fears about inflation.
In addition to the report, which sparked a surge in U.S. stocks and bonds, gold continued to suffer from
disappointment about the Nov. 29 British gold auction.
The active February gold future on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $5 to
$282.10 a troy ounce, bringing its loss for the week to $12.90.
"The unemployment report translated into a surge in stocks and bonds. It showed no inflationary pressures,
which was negative for gold," said William O'Neill, chief futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls added 234,000 workers last month, after a 263,000
increase in October. The slowdown kept the unemployment rate, already at a 29-year low, steady at 4.1%.
While largely within expectations, the figures eased concerns about inflation, and analysts said they
indicated that the Federal Reserve isn't likely to raise interest rates in December. Evidence that inflation is
at bay diminishes the likelihood that investors will turn to gold as a hedge.
The economic report came on the heels of the "main negative for the week," the British gold auction, said Mr.
O'Neill. "The market is still suffering a hangover from that." He added, "For anyone who was thinking there
was going to be some {year-2000} accumulation of gold, I think this auction completely eliminated that idea."
The ratio of bids to auctioned gold was 2.1 to 1, compared with 8 to 1 in the previous auction in September,
Mr. O'Neill said.
That a gold mine was awarded the bulk of the gold also was bearish, analysts and traders said, because it
showed other parties weren't major bidders and that the mine will have gold with which to balance any short
sales it has made. A surge in prices in September and October was fueled in part by short-covering, or the
buying of gold to meet selling commitments, among gold miners.
"People were cautiously bullish ahead of the auction, but when a producer of gold comes in and buys 40% of
the gold, it's not a very positive sign," said Tim Gardiner, head of precious metals with Mitsui USA in New
York.
In other commodity markets Friday:
COFFEE: Futures surged again on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of
Trade on forecasts of dry weekend weather in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, which has suffered
crop damage from dry weather. The March contract climbed 8.10 cents to $1.4405 a pound, bringing its gain
for the week to about 30 cents. Those forecasts prompted buying by speculators and kept most producers
from selling into the rally, traders said. Brazilian "producers are not selling and who knows better than
producers what the weather is like in their country," said one trader.
LUMBER: Futures fell at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to talk of excess supplies, participants said.
After a limit-down move in intraday trading, the leading January contract settled $10 lower at $334.10 per
thousand board feet. "There are wholesalers who have excess quantities of unsold lumber in their hands," a
Canadian-based trader said.

Time to Tame Exchange Rates
Time to Tame Exchange Rates

English
(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Major currencies have been gyrating in value of late. Since May the dollar has strengthened 6% against the
euro and weakened 18% against the yen. Other currencies have had even bigger changes in value.
Yesterday the euro dropped below $1 for the first time.
My reading is that the euro is stable, the dollar strong and the yen too strong. While the euro has weakened
sharply against the yen, it is stable relative to gold and other commodity prices and against its own price
index. Thus, while the volatility of the euro is one contributor to Europe's economic sluggishness, the level of
the euro is probably just about right. The strength of the dollar relative to the euro is probably a response to
Y2K concerns, faster growth expectations for the U.S. and Europe's persistent efforts to stop tax competition
on the Continent.
The yen, by contrast, is strong against gold and commodity prices, all world currencies and its own price
indexes, which have been registering severe deflation. Japan should acknowledge that the yen's strength is a
signal that its monetary policy is too tight. It should shift from its failed government spending policy to
monetary stimulus, expanding central-bank assets until deflation stops.
While currency gyrations create short-term winners and losers, the long-term loser is the entire global
economy. Unnecessary currency volatility is costly: It risks deflation for some, inflation for others. It helps big
businesses, which can partially insure the risk, relative to small businesses, which can't. It impedes
cross-border investments, slowing the spread of new-era productivity gains from the U.S. to other countries.
And it contributes to the polarization of global capital, creating surpluses of capital in some (mostly rich)
countries and shortages of capital elsewhere.
The latest volatility should prompt countries to recognize that long-term currency stability is achievable and in
their interests. When the economic theory of floating exchange rates was invented, it did not envision a world
in which major currencies would change value by 50% every few years, as we've seen with the yen.
America has contributed to the confusion over global exchange-rate policy. In recent years, the U.S. has
seemed to build its entire exchange rate view on the oversimplification that a strong dollar is in the national
interest. Yet it has declined to explain how a currency's strength should be measured or whether unlimited
strength is good. Meanwhile, through the International Monetary Fund, it has regularly recommended weak
currencies for poor countries.
A stable currency, not a "strong" or "weak" one, is appropriate during most of a country's economic life. A
strong-dollar policy made sense after a period of currency weakness and inflation such as the U.S.
experienced in 1993 and 1994. But by continuing the policy after a substantial strengthening of the dollar, the
administration created a momentum play into the U.S. dollar, adding to global currency volatility. Developing
countries have been whipsawed by the strength of the dollar and the vacuum of economic thought at the IMF.
While Brazil, Ecuador, Turkey and Colombia pursue weak-currency policies, Mexico and Southeast Asia have
pursued strong-currency policies this year. In all these countries, stable currencies with low volatility would
add dramatically to their long-term economic growth rates.
At the core of the economic confusion is the prevailing, and harmful, view that the value of a currency should
change with the business cycle to reflect economic fundamentals. The currency should weaken when an
economy slumps, the argument goes, and strengthen when it accelerates. This was the logic that has pushed
the euro to extreme weakness in early July and that has strengthened the yen to 102 per dollar, so strong
that it will choke off Japan's recovery.
We know from experience that currencies can be independent of a country's economic health. In May 1998
Japan's yen was sinking below 140 per dollar. The common analysis was that economic weakness and low
interest rates would push the yen to 160 per dollar. A year later, Japan's growth is limited to government
spending and exports, driving unemployment well above U.S. levels. Yet the yen is much stronger, the result

--- Page 55 ---
Page 55 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
of a policy of deflation caused by a contraction in the central bank's total assets. This dramatizes a country's
ability to control the value of its money regardless of economic conditions.
Europe should welcome a less jingoistic U.S. approach to exchange rates. Given its discomfort with the weak
euro -- actually, the strong dollar -- Europe may want to create a benchmark other than the dollar for
evaluating the euro. Otherwise, it will trap itself into viewing the world through American asset valuations.
This would cause mistakes in monetary policy and would reduce the attractiveness of investment in the
eurozone. My preference would be for the European Central Bank to evaluate the euro using the price of
gold or another indicator of the euro's absolute value. It would announce in advance that when the price of
the benchmark rises (meaning the value of the euro is falling), the quantity of euros will fall, and vice versa.
Evaluating the euro in absolute terms rather than relative to the dollar would allow Europe to refocus its
attention on structural reforms. Governments in Europe are massive and growing, at a time when world
competition will not tolerate this strategy. Taxes are stuck at very high levels, forcing the flight of jobs from the
Continent. Labor laws discourage employment, threatening to create a permanently unemployed and
unskilled European underclass. In order to focus on these true problems, the euro, like the dollar, should be
"strong and stable" and should be evaluated in absolute terms, not relative to its fluctuations against unstable
currencies elsewhere.
Wild swings in exchange rates are anti-growth and are the responsibility of government. The best policy for
growth -- in the U.S. and world-wide -- would be to seek currency stability rather than volatility.

Cocoa Falls as Ivory Coast Producers End Strike

NEW YORK -- Cocoa prices fell on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on news that Ivory Coast producers
ended a strike that had paralyzed the country's cocoa shipments and exports, traders said.
Ivory Coast, which accounts for more than 40% of world cocoa production, liberalized the sector Aug. 12,
abolishing a system of fixed prices from farm to port and leaving farmers vulnerable to falling world prices.
Producers, who had been on strike since Nov. 22 in protest, returned to work when demands were met to
reintroduce fixed prices.
The March contract fell $32 to $867 a metric ton on CSCE, a division of the New York Board of Trade. It had
shot up $73 Monday on news that producers had threatened to continue the strike for one more week and
burn stocks. Some cocoa was burned -- estimates range from 10,000 to 70,000 metric tons.
Traders said the strike's end meant a resumption of physical sales and futures sales to hedge them.
Chocolate manufacturers' buying lent support as prices dropped, they added.
Cocoa will resume its downtrend now that the supply disruptions have ended, traders and analysts said, with
the March contract likely to retest the low of $812 a metric ton it registered in late November.
"The flow of cocoa should be smooth and continue picking up through the middle of February," said analyst
Boyd Cruel of Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
Some saw a limit to the price decline.
"With the market coming off there is more reason to suspect there will be a market bottom, rather than a
steady decline," said Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York, explaining that the strike
showed the market that prices can't fall indefinitely without a producer reaction. "Manufacturers will be keen
to buy on price breaks in fear that things could flare up in the Ivory Coast again," she added.
In an attempt to stabilize world prices, Ivory Coast producers said they will create a buffer stock of 150,000
metric tons. Market watchers were skeptical that the burning or stockpiling will make a dent in futures prices
as world supply far outweighs demand, a fundamental influence that has been pressuring prices for months,
traders added.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures rebounded from negative territory to settle with modest gains at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, as the heavy selling seen earlier in the week dried up. The January contract rose 41
cents to $25 a barrel, after falling to as low as $24.10. Traders said a sharp fall in prices left the market
oversold and prompted short covering, or the buying of futures to cancel previous sales. "We saw some short
covering late in the day, but given the rout in the market over the past two days, we're not talking about much
of a recovery," said John Kilduff, senior vice president, energy-risk management at Fi mat USA Inc. in New
York.
GOLD: Futures dropped on the Comex division of Nymex following Monday's disappointing U.K. gold
auction, analysts said. The February contract fell $1.10 to $291.90 a troy ounce. A stronger U.S. dollar, which
diminishes the appeal of gold as a hedge against inflation, contributed to the weakness, analysts said.

Gold Futures Prices Fall Amid Weak Auction

Gold Futures Prices Fall Amid Weak Auction

NEW YORK -- Gold futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange took a nose dive
after tepid bidding at the latest United Kingdom gold auction, participants said.
In the third of five scheduled gold auctions, the Bank of England sold 25 metric tons of gold, or 803,600
ounces, at an allotment price of $293.50 a troy ounce. Each ounce of gold available drew only 2.1 times as
many bids, compared with an eight-to-one ratio at the last auction in September. Comex's February contract
slid $8.30 to $293.50 an ounce.
"It was a poor auction and that certainly shows that there's not an overwhelming demand for physical gold
here over the short term," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York.
Mr. O'Neill said the main reason for price weakness was the outcome of the sale didn't match expectations.
"People were anticipating a decent auction, a better-received one, and clearly it didn't turn out that way," he
said.
David Meger, a senior metals analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago, said given the large amount of
net long positions, bets that prices would rise, larger demand would have been needed to move prices higher.
"Because it was relatively neutral to probably unfriendly, a large amount of those net longs jumped out of the
market," by selling futures, Mr. Meger said.
George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities in New York, also attributed gold's drop to
participants' exiting the Comex December contract ahead of its first notice day today, when contract holders
will begin declaring their intention of making or taking delivery. Pure speculators are usually unwilling to hold
contracts during that period for fear of being involved in the physical-commodity trade underlying the futures
contract.
Most participants said they expect gold prices to consolidate within the range of $288 to $300 an ounce until
year end.
"For the most part, it's going to be difficult to find demand until next year . . . Y2K fears have dissipated
because it turns out that most of the western world is Y2K-prepared and there's not that anxiety that existed a
month ago . . . that lessened demand also," Mr. Gero said. "Plus, there's a rebound in the stock market,
interest rates are going up, and that's bearish, because it makes gold more expensive . . . so all these
things came at a wrong time like they usually do."
In other commodity markets:
COCOA: Futures surged on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade in
reaction to protests against the recent liberalization of the market by producers in Ivory Coast, traders said.
The March contract leapt $73 to $927 a metric ton. Ivory Coast producers began striking Nov. 22 and have
threatened to burn cocoa stocks if their demands for higher fixed prices aren't met. Traders said concerns
about a lack of supply from the world's largest producer led to the covering of shorts-the buying of futures to
balance previous sales-by participants concerned they might not have the cocoa to make delivery

CRUDE OIL: Futures fell at Nymex on signs that Iraq will soon return to the export market. The country
recently rejected an extension of the oil-for-food deal with the United Nations. The January contract dropped
91 cents to $25.96 a barrel. Sources said Iraq pumped 300,000 barrels Monday through the Iraq-Turkey
pipeline as it has done every day since Wednesday. Although the pipe can handle one million barrels a day,
the limited restart was viewed as a sign that Iraq will fully return to the export market.

Government Starts Minting New `Golden Dollar'

Pretty soon, you may not recognize the money in your pocket.
The U.S. Mint began full-scale production of a new $1 coin yesterday, a gold-colored depiction of the Native
American explorer Sacagawea that replaces the Susan B. Anthony coin. The new coin is part of a revamping
of U.S. money that includes new $5 and $10 bills next year, which have the presidents' images set off-center.
(Twenty-dollar bills and larger denominations already have been changed.)
With the new $1 coin, dubbed the "Golden Dollar," the Mint is banking on an ambitious marketing plan, a new
design and 20 years of inflation since the "Susie's" introduction to help the new coin succeed. Officials and
even the coin's proponents say its chances of replacing the paper dollar are virtually nil. But coin-dependent
entities such as mass-transit systems, the Postal Service and the $23 billion vending industry are still hoping
the Sacagawea dollar will provide a boon.
"We're coming to a time when the dollar coin will probably be more useful than people would like to admit,"
said Rep. Michael Castle (R., Del.), who wrote the 1997 law paving the way for the new coins. "Because the
cost of things is higher, there are more items you simply have to spend a dollar on, so this is a good solution."
The new coins are about the size of Susan B. Anthony dollars, will be in circulation by early 2000, and are
made of an alloy of manganese, brass and copper.
Believe it or not, this all started because the country was running out of Susan B. Anthony $1 coins.
U.S. Mint Director Philip N. Diehl said that as coin-operated machines have proliferated, the need for Susan
B. Anthony dollars has grown from about 12 million coins to 60 million in less than five years. With supplies
dwindling after 20 years of the older coin being in circulation, the Mint decided it had to revamp one of its
most unsuccessful products.
"We found that consumers never really liked the coin because it looked too much like a quarter, and there
was no marketing to create any excitement for it," Mr. Diehl said.
Neither of those factors will be the case with the new coin.
The Mint will begin an aggressive four-month advertising campaign in March and also has arranged for the
new dollars to be distributed in a limited number of cereal boxes.
An eight-member committee of experts, government officials and citizens chose Sacagawea to be depicted
on the coin. She was a Shoshone Indian woman who acted as a guide and translator for explorers Lewis and
Clark on their expedition to the Pacific Ocean.
The choice was one fraught with political overtones, particularly in the early stages of the decision making.
One side, led by Rep. Castle, vocally backed the Statue of Liberty, while another pushed for Sacagawea.
But from the outset, then U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin told the committee their choice had to be a
woman.
"Ultimately, we decided that we wanted someone who had actually lived, not an allegorical figure. After all, no
one ever says we need to have mythical men on our currency," said committee member Patricia A. McGuire,
who is president of Trinity College, a Catholic women's school in Washington.
The Mint estimates that demand for the coins will total $100 million next year, much of which will be spent on
coin-dispensed goods and services ranging from sodas to bus fares.

In commodity trading yesterday:
WHEAT: Forecasts for precipitation in the arid U.S. Great Plains pushed futures to new contract lows at the
Chicago Board of Trade. Front-month December wheat futures fell 5.25 cents to $2.4050 a bushel, the lowest
settlement for a nearby CBOT wheat contract since July. "Conditions are very dry in the wheat belt [but] there
are forecasts for a better chance of rain," said Steve Koch, analyst with the Stewart-Peterson Group in West
Bend, Wis. Forecasters expect two to three inches of rain across the wheat belt over the weekend and into
early next week. It would be the first rain in more than a month for much of the region.
COFFEE: Futures slipped at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade
amid forecasts for rain in Brazil's coffee-growing regions and on talk of ample supplies. Nearby March futures
fell 13.25 cents to $1.167 a pound. "The weather pattern in Brazil has changed; beneficial rains look to be
ahead of us," said James Cordier, a trader with Liberty Trading Group in St. Petersburg, Fla. Separately, a
report Wednesday by the Association of Coffee Producing Countries forecast a heavy world coffee surplus for
the period from April 2000 through March 2001.

Late this month in Seattle, thousands of protesters organized by area churches plan to ring a World Trade
Organization conference and make a plea for rich nations to forgive the debts of poor ones. "We need to
correct the imbalances," says the Rev. John Boonstra, who heads the Washington Association of Churches.
The protest reflects the most contemporary of concerns: whether the poor benefit from the global economy.
But it also taps a tradition that runs deeply through U.S. history. During times of prosperity, social movements
focusing on moral issues come to the fore.
Abolitionism gained momentum during the gold rush and railroad booms of the 1840s and 1850s, prohibition
during the Gilded Age at the turn of the century, and civil rights during the post-World War II era. Some of the
movements seem deplorable today; during the Roaring '20s, blacks, Asians and other ethnic groups were
repressed because they didn't seem sufficiently "American."
"Prosperity gives people who want to start movements a sense that they can get the resources together,"
says Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University historian. "Movements aren't usually made up of people who
are desperate."
Social movements don't appear merely because a society is wealthy, of course. But economic growth is an
important element. When personal income rises and individuals become increasingly confident about their
future, economic worries begin to fade, and social issues are spotlighted. "Values trump economics in
economic good times," says David King, a Harvard University political scientist.
For the past few years, personal incomes have been rising, inflation is down and unemployment is at a
decades-long low. That is hardly enough time for '60s-style mass movements to develop. But historians say
that a number of activist causes today have the potential to capture national attention.
Churches and other religious organizations are often involved-institutions that the largely secular mass media
tend to overlook. For instance, many conservative and evangelical churches have made commitments to help
women once on welfare to find and hold jobs. The Christian Women's Job Corps in Birmingham, Ala., recruits
and trains volunteers in about 110 locations around the country. They serve as "mentors" for at least one year
to help former welfare recipients find child care, arrange transportation and navigate the other problems that
crop up in the job world.
Religious instruction plays an important role. "When someone is introduced to Bible study, they find a support
system they never had before," says Trudy Johnson, director of Job Corps.
Although the mixture of social counseling and religious instruction makes some secular advocates of the poor
uncomfortable, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush have courted the activist groups.
Appearing at a Salvation Army adult-rehabilitation center in Atlanta, Mr. Gore talked of a "dramatic
transformation in America," which he identified as "a newly vigorous grass-roots movement tied to nonprofit
institutions, many of them faith-based and valuesbased organizations."
Church members' welfare activism makes them aware of other political issues-politicizing them, in the lingo of
the '60s. Many of the new issues involve the global economy. "There is an overlap," says Ms. Johnson,
ticking off issues such as debt relief and sweatshop conditions abroad. "We have had to learn a lot about fair
trade."
On U.S. campuses, improving working conditions in foreign sweatshops is a burgeoning cause. Organized
under the banner of United Students Against Sweatshop, activists are pressuring college administrators to
guarantee that T-shirts and other goods printed with college logos aren't imported from factories that violate
basic labor rights. The effort is led by several student activists who learned organizing techniques during

summer internships in 1997 with Unite, the textile-workers union. As part of their campaign, students at the
University of Michigan held a sit-in at an administrator's office.
Eric Brakken, the group's national organizer, says the students want universities to disclose the names and
locations of the factories and dismiss a Clinton administration-led effort to get clothing makers to agree on
codes of conduct as a "whitewash." But Terry Collingsworth, general counsel of the International Labor Rights
Fund, a church-backed group, says that the student activities could backfire by prompting importers to switch
factories -- and leave poor workers jobless.
Todd Gitlin, a New York University sociologist who studies social protest, says the sweatshop movement
echoes '60s student causes because both made a link between "moral passion and the university
environment."
Starting Nov. 29, globalization issues will be at the forefront of protests, as the WTO, the international body
that sets trade rules, meets in Seattle to launch a new round of global trade negotiations. Thousands of
activists are expected, with the bulk consisting of union members who worry about a classic pocketbook
issue: Expanded imports could threaten their jobs.
But many of the others expected in Seattle will focus on predominantly moral issues: Do rules crafted to
expand trade internationally conflict with environmental laws in different countries? Will worker protections
become obsolete if companies find it even easier to invest abroad? Do nations themselves become
outmoded if capital and goods controlled by private investors determine a nation's economic prospects?
Mike Dolan, who is coordinating the protests, says he relies on local churches to help organize teach-ins and
seminars on the subjects. "It's not coincidental that the principal venues we have organized for our parallel
critique of the WTO are all churches," he says.
During another period of prosperity, the Gilded Age, another group of reformers asked similar questions
about the role of big business in the economy. The Progressives successfully pushed for stiff enforcement of
laws to break up monopolies and to regulate food and drugs.
But the protesters in Seattle face a more difficult challenge. The Progressives could argue that government
ought to contain corporate power. But now that corporate power is transnational, few are arguing for
transnational bodies to regulate them. Indeed one of the themes of the antiglobalization protesters is that
international bodies, such as the WTO, already have too much power.
But the dilemma hasn't dimmed the enthusiasm of protesters. "Economic justice is strongly biblical," says the
Rev. Boonstra. "It's a uniting point and brings together people of faith."

As an emergency-room physician, David Druz aided victims of trauma. But as a money manager, he couldn't
rescue himself from a string of disasters in the futures market.
On Oct. 29, after 18 years as a commodity-futures trading adviser, Dr. Druz told investors he was shutting
down the four futures funds run by his Tactical Investment Management Corp., which began the year with
more than $100 million, then plunged 38%, including 18% in October. Pulling the plug "was the saddest day
of my life," the 46-year-old doctor-turned-futures trader, speaking from his office in Hawaii, said with a sigh. "It
was like putting your dog to sleep, or pulling your relative off a respirator. October was a rough month for our
industry. Everything in October seemed to reverse. It pushed us over the edge."
Dr. Druz is a veteran commodity-trading adviser, or CTA, one of a risk-taking cadre of money managers who
make directional bets on everything from gold and pork bellies to stock futures and foreign currencies, and
generally keep 25% of their investors' profits. Last year, many commodity-trading advisers thrived in the
market turmoil that pounded hedge funds, with the average CTA gaining 12.2%, according to TASS
Investment Research. Through October of this year, the average CTA is down 1%, according to TASS, while
the average hedge fund is beating the S&P 500.
The major commodity indexes, in fact, have been edging up this year. But futures traders like more
pronounced volatility, because they make money betting on price trends. Major trends have been in short
supply this year. To make matters worse, veteran traders have been hurt by continual "noise," the violent
up-and-down, short-term price movement unconnected to long-term trends. Such noise can plan havoc with
systematic traders such as Dr. Druz, who feed commodity-pricing data into custom-programmed computers,
which determine the prices at which to buy and sell commodities.
"Noise has stayed up for a long time now," Dr. Druz complained. "This will play havoc with a highly leveraged
program." For example, the coffee market in October experienced "a tremendous up and down that came out
of nowhere and made no sense whatsoever," he recalls. "That hurt."
Dr. Druz's Tactical Investment, Henderson, Nev., isn't the only firm that has been battered.
Commodity-trading adviser John W. Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins, saw his largest trading program, the
$900 million Financial & Metals Portfolio, decline by 8.2% in October, and 14% for the year. "It's been a
difficult market for all trend-followers," says Verne Sedlacek, the company's president. "There's been
short-term volatility, but not a lot of long-term trends."
The $2 billion portfolio of Millburn Ridgefield Corp. is down about 5% for the year, mostly because of its poor
performance in October, says Co-Chief Executive George Crapple, who is also chairman of the Managed
Funds Association, a CTA trade group. "It was going along as a sort of boring, nonexceptional year until this
happened," he said, citing an unexpected run-up in energy prices sparked by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries' decision to continue its production limits. Most systematic traders had been betting on
continued weakness in the energy market.
"The environment is not trending well," noted Christopher Pia, head of trading at veteran trader Louis Bacon's
Moore Capital Management, which had losses of about 2% in October in several funds, although they have
since recovered, and remain marginally up for the year. Many of the most popular global macro bets made by
CTAs -- such as wagers on a strong euro, and against the S&P 500 index and gold -- "didn't pan out," he
said.
The Barclay Futures Index, which tracks 25 of the most liquid futures markets, was down 2.9% during a
"brutal" October, says Sol Waksman of Barclay Trading Group, which tracks the performance of
futures-trading advisers. That was the largest monthly decline since the 1980s, he said. Barclays is based in
Fairfield, Iowa.

Dr. Druz, whose four funds averaged returns of between 15% and 21% annually over the lives of the funds,
had about 150 investors, ranging from small individual accounts to sizeable institutional ones. He focused on
physical commodities: gold, food, grains, petroleum, metals, and the like. He used up to twice as much
leverage as the industry norm, he said.
Dr. Druz said his firm's quantitative trading system closely tracked such internal trading statistics as the
win/loss ratio, the distribution of wins and losses, and the size of wins in relation to the capital put at risk. The
rules of the four Tactical Trading funds required those statistics to stay within certain boundaries.
After generating a lackluster 13% return last year, he said, the firm faced "slow erosion" this year. "There
were more frequent losses than we would normally have, and the wins we had were smaller."
In October, "all the trades that we were trying to get going reversed," he said. First bets on petroleum and
metals went bad, he explained, then certain agricultural bets soured, and finally interest rates reversed. "The
last part of October was horrific," he recalled. On Oct. 28, the firm's internal trading statistics moved outside
of their mandated limits. The next day, he closed the funds.
"We are all quite in shock, since only a month ago things seemed to be looking up after over a year of very
tough trading conditions for our system," he wrote investors. "But markets have a way of astonishing you, and
they deteriorated precipitously during October. In the more than 18 years that we have been managing these
funds, I have never seen such a prolonged, brutal period for our particular trading style. It is simply time to
say, `Thank you very much, but I don't like the way this game is being played any more. I have already
soundly won many times over. I am going home. It's been fun!'"
Dr. Druz unwound all four funds, and shipped the proceeds to investors last week. "If you are one of the few
investors who joined us in the last couple of years, I feel very badly that we will never be able to recoup all of
your money," he wrote. "Please accept my sincere apology that things turned out this way."
Dr. Druz said he now plans to turn his attention to a systematic stock-trading project, in which he aims to be
able to feed stock prices into a computer, which will churn out buy and sell instructions. He says he expects
some of his former commodities investors to partake.
"This is not a case of burnout," he said. "I love this business."

Crude-Oil Prices Rise for Third Straight Session

Crude-Oil Prices Rise for Third Straight Session

NEW YORK -- Crude-oil prices climbed for the third straight session at the New York Mercantile Exchange to
set a 34-month high of $25.75 a barrel, as analysts began to express some concern about year-2000 supply
glitches.
The December contract settled just under that high at $25.70 a barrel, with a 57-cent gain.
The Y2K talk was new to the market conversation, but even some skeptics conceded there were signs that
petroleum stockpiling related to the new year was under way.
"We definitely have the sense homeowners are stockpiling heating oil ahead of Y2K," said Bill O'Grady, an
energy analyst with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "And I think we'll see a run on gasoline in December."
One piece of data analysts focused on was the sharp drop in U.S. distillate stocks, which include heating oil,
over the past month despite moderate to warm weather. Inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute
released after the Nymex closed yesterday showed distillate stocks down 10 million barrels since the week
ended Oct. 15.
The potential for problems with computer chips in oil and petroleum-product pumping equipment, and with
navigational instruments on tankers are some of the more prominent glitches talked about in the market.
Mr. O'Grady sees current fundamentals and Y2K concerns pushing nearby crude oil as high as $28 a barrel
by the end of the year. Any actual Y2K disruptions in oil-producing nations could push prices well above $30
a barrel, he said.
The backbone of the most recent leg of the 1999 uptrend, though, has been evidence that output cuts by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are allowing strong demand to eat into world crude supplies,
analysts said.
The API data provided further proof of that trend. In addition to the distillate decline, they showed a
2.29-million-barrel drop in U.S. crude-oil stocks to a tight 308.97 million barrels, and a large 4.95million-barrel
decline in gasoline stocks to 189.46 million barrels.
If these trends continue, energy prices are likely to be extremely vulnerable to any disruption in the product
delivery system at the start of next year, A.G. Edwards's Mr. O'Grady said.
Crude-oil bulls reacted yesterday to an expected meeting in Riyadh today of Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali
Naimi, Mexican minister Luis Tellez and Venezuelan minister Ali Rodriguez. Ministers from these three
countries first met in 1998 and engineered the output cuts that sparked crude's powerful recovery this year.
This time around, some analysts think the ministers are laying the ground work for an extension of those cuts
beyond their phaseout date in March 2000. That speculation was bolstered by comments from several OPEC
ministers supporting just such an extension.
With OPEC now expected to keep its cuts in place past a March 2000 phaseout date, concerns about supply
shortages heading into the first quarter of 2000 are growing by the day, analysts said.
There is some talk in the market that higher oil prices will tempt OPEC members into cheating on their
agreements. But one analyst said the group seems determined to further reduce world stocks, which are still
above levels seen before the 1998 Asian financial crisis sharply reduced world oil demand.

--- Page 67 ---

"We're getting to a point where you hope OPEC does cheat to keep prices from the point where they damage
the U.S. economy," said Tim Evans, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometrics Group, a market research
company in New York.
And analysts are rethinking the notion that OPEC wants prices no higher than $21 a barrel to prevent new
sources of production from coming on line.
"The big drop in oil prices in 1997 and 1998 spooked a lot of people out of the oil market. There's a window
now for OPEC to raise prices by cutting back production and not risk losing market share," said A.G
Edwards's Mr. O'Grady.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures prices rose on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, shrugging off news
of a rise in U.S. official interest rates, traders and analysts said. The December contract rose $2.80 to
$295.30 a troy ounce. Demand for physical gold supported the market despite a sharp rise in the U.S. stock
market, which often reduces the appeal of gold as an investment.
COTTON: Futures prices fell on the New York Cotton Exchange as speculators sold ahead of the expiration
of the December contract, traders said. The contract slipped 1.34 cents to 49.22 cents a pound. First-notice
day for the December contract is Nov. 22, when holders will announce their intention of making or taking
delivery of the physical commodity. Open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding, remained at a
relatively high 23,581 in December as of late Monday.

Nasdaq's Surge Is Fueled by a Mere Few---Some Say Laggards Must Shine for Gains to Continue

What comes after Nasdaq 3000: Nasdaq 4000 or Nasdaq 2500?
All the hoopla surrounding Nasdaq 3000 last week masked some interesting aspects of the Nasdaq
Composite Index's rise to stock-market dominance: The advance has been going on for longer than many
investors realize, but of late it has been driven by a surprisingly small group of stocks.
That raises a question: When a stock index becomes so dominated by a handful of names, how long can the
gains continue? "Some of those companies are going to be worth it, but I think the majority aren't going to be
worth it," says David Mead, chief investment officer at Harris Bank. "Ultimately you will have more democracy
in the stock market," he adds, meaning that a wider group of stocks will start to perform better. Then,
investors will realize that "many of the top companies are priced too high." He still likes networking colossus
Cisco Systems, for example, but he has his doubts about software mammoth Microsoft.
The antitrust ruling against Microsoft, announced after markets closed on Friday, throws an additional cloud
over the stock, which as it happens was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average just last week.
Of course, experienced investors have been warning for years now that the highfliers could fall to earth. Up to
now, it hasn't happened. And certainly, no one was worrying much last week.
In the wake of much-awaited data released Friday showing only modest wage inflation last month, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average jumped 64.84 points, or 0.61%, to 10704.48 on Friday. It still was down 25.38 for
the week. The Nasdaq composite, by contrast, soared 1.5% Friday to finish at a record 3102.29, up 4.6% in
five trading days.
It was an eye-popping week and just the latest of many. The biggest Nasdaq gains have come in the 1990s.
But in the 28 years since it was born, the Nasdaq composite has surpassed the performance of all three of its
major competitors, the Dow Jones industrials, the Standard & Poor's 500stock index and the New York Stock
Exchange composite, in 15 of those yearsmore than half. It looks likely to lead the pack again in 1999.
During that time, the Nasdaq composite has risen more than 3,000%, a gain that is hard to grasp in concrete
terms. It means that if you had been able to invest $10,000 in the index in 1971, it would be worth more than
$310,000 today. A similar investment in the Dow Jones industrials or in the composite index of the New York
Stock Exchange or the S&P 500 would be worth less than half as much.
It seems remarkable that such heady gains are being posted by an index that tracks an entire stock market
and not just a select group of stocks. That is true, but it is a deceptive conclusion to draw. In fact, a coterie of
technology stocks has become so large and powerful that those stocks dominate the Nasdaq composite.
The composite tracks the performance of all 4,845 stocks listed on Nasdaq. But it weighs the gains and
losses of each share of stock, not each company. So a company with 10 million shares weighs 10 times as
much as one with just one million shares.
Since Oct. 8 of last year, when the stock market began to shake off worries about the world financial crisis, it
isn't really the Nasdaq composite that has more than doubled in value. It isn't the Nasdaq that has eclipsed
the Big Board. It is a group of about 65 Nasdaq stocks that account for almost the entire gain. Without those
stocks, the Nasdaq-listed stocks literally have gone nowhere this year.
Just three Nasdaq stocks, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Intel, alone produced almost 40% of the index's gain
since Oct. 8. Add MCI WorldCom and Sun Microsystems, and the five account for almost half the total gain,
according to Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn. As long as those five soar (Sun is up more than 400% in
that period), the index is healthy. If they sink, as they did 15 months ago, the index could get clobbered.

Believers in the Nasdaq composite would counter that encouraging the growth of young companies into
market movers is the whole point of Nasdaq. Even during the Microsoft era, new powerhouses, such as
Qualcomm, have been able to roar into action. But the doubters note that the strength of many of the Nasdaq
stocks has been based on the bull market's bias toward "growth" stocks, which generate big earnings and
profit growth and command high prices. If investors shift back toward "value" stocks, which have slower
earnings growth and much lower prices compared with their earnings, then the Nasdaq highfliers could suffer.
Already, Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer, for example, have been gaining ground less rapidly than the
overall Nasdaq composite itself. The fastest growers since October 1998 have been stocks such as
Qualcomm, Sun and Cisco.
James Weiss, chief investment officer for stocks at Boston mutual-fund group State Street Research, thinks
out-of-favor stocks could shine more brightly next year. When the world economy began roaring again in the
spring, out-of-favor industrial stocks and small stocks took off, then cooled. "As we move into next year, and
investors get comfortable that we do have global economic growth" and relatively stable interest rates, he
says, "that will encourage investors to begin to broaden their exposure." He says this will benefit a broader
array of issues than the big tech names -- notably industrial stocks and small stocks.
Perhaps, says Michael Weiner, portfolio manager, at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. But
like it or not, "the single best predictor of future returns over an extended period is how well a stock has
done," he says. "The stuff that has done well continues to do well and it does well longer than you think."
Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates says the real objective for everyone except index investors isn't to figure
out which index will do better, but which stocks will do better, and buy those.
"It isn't unusual for a small group of stocks to be so dominant," he says. "In 1965, AT&T and General Motors
together accounted for almost 15% of the S&P. In the past three or four years, 25% to 30% of the buying on
the New York Stock Exchange has been concentrated on the Dow 30," and that continues. He adds: "This
market is more narrow than it has been in 40 years, and yet from the middle of January to now we have had a
nice move. The answer is that you have to pick stocks well. If we are having a bear market for the majority of
stocks, fine, buy the minority."

Gold Declines on Investor-Friendly Labor Figures

Gold prices fell Friday, following the release of U.S. October employment data, which eased investor
concerns about inflation.
Market participants viewed the data as a good opportunity to sell gold, noting that the market has been
struggling since its surprise rebound in late September and early October, sparked by news that 15 European
central banks intend to limit their gold sales and lending over the next five years.
The nearby December future on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange slipped $2.70 to
$291.00 a troy ounce. While gold has eased considerably since its Oct. 5 spike to $339.00 an ounce, it
remains well above the 20-year low of about $253 it held close to during much of the past summer.
Traders focused on news of a rise of just one cent in average hourly earnings of nonfarm workers to $13.37
in October, viewed as proof that there is little wage inflation in the economy.
Evidence that inflation is at bay diminishes the likelihood that investors will purchase the precious metal as
an inflation hedge. The data also contributed to a rally in Treasury bonds, an alternative investment to gold.
Gold "did fall right after that number," said Robin Alssid, senior dealer with Mitsubishi International Corp. in
New York. "It was probably more of an excuse to sell. {Gold has} sort of been in a downtrend."
The gold market has "quieted down" since prices skyrocketed at the end of September and the beginning of
last month, said William O'Neill, chief futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York.
Lease rates, which reflect the cost of borrowing gold, have returned to typical levels, reducing some of the
liquidity concerns in the market, analysts said. "Tightness is no longer in play, so the market has taken on a
defensive tone," Mr. O'Neill said.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures reversed a morning rally at Nymex and ended with a moderate loss as traders booked
profits ahead of the weekend. The December contract slipped 14 cents to $23 a barrel. The morning rally was
sparked by news that an emissions release shut a 67,000-barrel-a-day catalytic cracking unit at the Deer
Park, Texas, refinery of Shell Deer Park Refining Co., a joint venture of Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.'s Shell Oil
Co. and Mexico's Petroleos Mexicanos. But one trader said the market was knocked off its highs by reports
that compliance by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with output-cut commitments had
fallen to 80%.
COCOA: Futures fell to a new 7 1/2-year low on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on speculative selling,
traders said. The December contract fell $6 to $830 a metric ton, after hitting a low of $825. Weakness in the
London market, which was pressured by producer selling, also weighed on New York prices, analysts added.

Corrections & Amplifications
REP. PHIL CRANE (R., Ill.) gave $38,000 to a Republican fund-raising drive, not $4,000 as reported in
Friday's Washington Wire. The incorrect information had been supplied by Mr. Crane's office. (WSJ -- Nov. 8,
1999)
GOP LEADERS WRITE big checks to protect their slender majority.
House Speaker Hastert, Majority Leader Armey and Whip DeLay kick in $50,000 each for a war chest to
bolster Republicans in 10 targeted races. Six shaky incumbents and four candidates for promising open seats
will get $100,000 apiece. One beneficiary: Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington, who faces a threatened $1
million attack from term-limit advocates after flip-flopping on his pledge to serve no more than six years.
The campaign profits from jockeying among senior Republicans for prime committee posts. Reps. Oxley of
Ohio and Tauzin of Louisiana -- dueling for the Commerce chairmanship that is coming open because of
GOP caucus term limits -- give $30,000 and $20,000, respectively. California Rep. Thomas, seeking to head
the tax-writing Ways and Means panel, tosses in $20,000.
Thomas's rival, Crane of Illinois, donates $4,000 so far, but an aide says, "There will probably be more."
GORE LABORS to capitalize on AFL-CIO endorsement in his White House bid.
The vice president uses union help in gathering petition signatures to qualify for New York's primary ballot.
Gore canvasses door to door with labor leaders in New Hampshire, where he wil address an AFL-CIO dinner
this weekend. Draft union fliers for key primary states contrast Gore's record with that of GOP front-runner
Bush, but don't mention Democratic rival Bradley.
Meeting with Teamsters leaders, who have withheld their endorsement, Gore says the administration hasn't
given labor and environmental concerns sufficient priority in trade talks. The White House dispatches a
deputy trade representative to India in a vain attempt to persuade New Delhi to support including labor issues
in WTO talks.
SOME OFFICIALS say Albanians inflated casualties to spur NATO action.
One American in the region now pegs civilian deaths in Kosovo last spring at no more than 2,500, blaming a
"disinformation campaign" by ethnic Albanian leaders for much higher earlier estimates. But another official
says that scores of suspected mass graves have yet to be examined, as investigations wind down amid bitter
weather.
The administration predicts that winter suffering in the region won't be as bad as feared. Since not all
refugees have returned, Kosovars won't need as much housing as once expected; some families also are
doubling up. "Winter will be bad, but not that bad," says one U.S. military officer back from Kosovo duty.
Every European head of state except Milosevic is invited to a meeting on emerging democracies during
Clinton's coming trip to Turkey.
FADED GOLD MINE? Banking lobbyists wave goodbye to a decades-long meal ticket with the expected
enactment of new financial-services legislation. One consolation: Wall Street lobbyist Tom Quinn jokes that
he asked lawmakers not to replace the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act until his three sons finished
college; all now have.

BOOBY PRIZE: U.S. negotiators in Bonn fail to delay final talks on the divisive Kyoto climate-change treaty.
They sought to give Clinton's successor breathing room by pushing talks into 2001, but Saudi Arabia and
other opponents insisted they begin Nov. 13, 2000 -- six days after the U.S. election.
SUPPLY-SIDE DEMOCRAT? Veteran Kemp booster David Smick hosts a $1,000-a-head fund-raiser for
Bradley's presidential bid, touting the candidate's knowledge of international economics and "ability to
transcend traditional politics" to would-be donors. A new Center for Responsive Politics study shows the
ex-Knick reaping $209,000 from partners at Goldman Sachs, more than twice either Bush or Gore.
HOUSE BOUND: Clintonites brace for flak over the nomination of Amy Comstock to head the Office of
Government Ethics. The career civil servant headed the White House ethics program when the First Family
tapped a top fund-raiser to back their $1.35 million home mortgage, a deal later scotched amid criticism.
A NEW BATTLE LOOMS over ways to prevent racial discrimination in lending.
A 1974 Federal Reserve regulation bars banks from asking borrowers about race, gender or nationality.
Backing a Fed proposal to change that rule, the White House and civil-rights groups now argue that banks
should collect such data to detect patterns of bias. Changing the rule will "allow us to monitor the progress we
are making," writes Union Bank of California.
The Fed says it still could pull back the proposal after considering public comments. Leading bank trade
groups will file a protest next week arguing against the change. Bush's top economic adviser, former Fed
governor Lawrence Lindsey, submits two missives attacking the shift.
Writing to Greenspan, House GOP Leader Armey says the proposal "flies in the face of our efforts to create a
more `colorblind' society."
MINOR MEMOS: Alpha wonk? Former Congressional Budget Office chief Robert Reischauer says he has
"kibitzed with" Bradley's team, but "I'm not a Naomi Wolf." . . . Satirist Al Franken says his dream 2000
scenario "is starting to happen" as ATM fees, centerpiece of his faux-campaign book, gain as a national
issue. . . . After Gore's campaign moves into a former Nashville medical office, controversial fundraiser Peter
Knight works behind a door marked "Clean Linen."

ASIA/PACIFIC
Mitsubishi Heavy
Joins Long List
Of Struggling Firms
Japan's heavy-machinery and shipbuilding companies suffered big losses in the fiscal first half ended Sept.
30, and analysts said the strong yen will continue to weigh on businesses in the second half. Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries said that it suffered an unconsolidated pretax loss of 29.74 billion yen ($285.7 million), the
first parent half-year loss since the company was established in a merger more than three decades ago.
Mitsubishi Heavy blamed the loss on increased competition at home and abroad, the poor Japanese
economy and reduced exports to Asian economies. Reflecting the poor demand environment, its sales
plunged by nearly 18% to 916.36 billion yen. A strong yen can hurt results both because of currency
translation of sales made abroad and because of reduced imports by other countries.
If misery loves company, Mitsubishi has got plenty. Kawasaki Heavy Industries last week posted its first
interim pretax loss in 12 years. With Asian economies back on track toward recovery, Japanese machinery
makers and shipbuilders find themselves confronting increasingly competitive rivals in neighboring countries
such as South Korea, where the cheap won allows exporters to sell products more inexpensively overseas. In
response to the conditions gripping the industry, Mitsubishi Heavy also unveiled the details of a four-year
restructuring plan. It said it would reduce group staff by 7,000 to 64,000 by March 2004 through attrition. At
the parent company, payrolls will be trimmed to 35,000 from the current 40,000.
Taiwan Quake Causes Little Damage
Taiwan's latest big earthquake, a 6.9-magnitude tremor centered off the island's southern coast, caused little
damage and, despite persistent aftershocks, isn't expected to disrupt the island's closely watched shipments
of computer chips and other electronics, industry executives said. That's a very different story from the
island's last major earthquake, on Sept. 21, which left more than 2,400 people dead and 100,000 homeless
and shut down the island's computer-chip industry. Then, prices for computer chips soared around the world
as the disruption cut supplies just as the industry was heading into its peak season. But the epicenter of
September's 7.6 quake was the middle of the island, while the latest one was in the ocean, far from high-tech
manufacturing areas in northern Taiwan.
Mou Enters Plea in Fraud Case
A well-known Chinese entrepreneur pleaded not guilty to charges that he defrauded a state-run bank of $75
million. Mou Qizhong, head of Land Economic Group and once one of China's richest men, told the Wuhan
Intermediate People's Court he had legitimately borrowed the money to launch satellites in Kazakstan. If the
loan was not legal, Mr. Mou said, that was the fault of the Bank of China, among others, as the bank issued
the letter of credit. The one-day trial was notable for its lack of witnesses. One co-defendant, Mr. Mou's
former chief financial officer, turned state's witness. A verdict is expected in eight days, and Mr. Mou could
receive a life sentence, which would likely result in his serving 10 years in prison.
Japan Forecasts Tax Shortfall
Japan said its tax revenues will fall more than a trillion yen ($9.6 billion) short of the budgeted amount in the
current fiscal year, forcing the government to use funds from a supplemental budget to fill the gap. Reflecting
the sluggish business environment, the government recently had to return 400 billion yen in prepaid corporate
taxes to companies whose earnings fell short of expectations in the past fiscal year. Meanwhile, Japan's

economy grew by a real 0.1% in the July-September quarter compared with the previous period, according to
a report released by Nomura Research Institute. Japan's Economic Planning Agency isn't expected to
release its preliminary findings for July-September GDP until early December.
BRIEFLY:
-- Morgan Stanley Capital International has delayed the return of Malaysia to its benchmark indexes by three
months until May 31, 2000, to avoid market uncertainty over possible leap-year computer glitches. Market
watchers said the move could prove troublesome for anyone betting on an MSCI-inspired market rally in
Malaysia at the start of next year.
-- Citigroup said it acquired 19% of Nikko Beans, a Japanese Internet brokerage firm that began operations

EUROPE/AFRICA
Anglo American-Tarmac Talks End
Anglo American, a London mining and financial conglomerate, announced that talks about a possible
takeover of British building-materials maker Tarmac ended Friday after Tarmac rejected an offer of 550 pence
($9.01) a share, or about GBP 1.13 billion ($1.86 billion). Tarmac had previously rejected an offer of 535
pence a share, or about GBP 1.1 billion. Among other things, Anglo American is the parent of Anglogold of
South Africa, the world's biggest gold-mining company. Anglogold recently bid for Ghana's Ashanti
Goldfields, Africa's third-largest gold producer, and Australian group Anaconda Nickel. Anglogold said it is
interested in Ashanti Goldfields' biggest operating mine, Obuasi, in Ghana and a promising new mine, Geita,
in Tanzania. The Ghanaian gold miner remains in takeover talks with its biggest shareholder, Lonmin, a U.K.
mining group. Separately, Gold Fields, South Africa's second-largest gold miner, said it will pay a 62%
market premium to acquire the shares it doesn't own in junior producer St. Helena Gold Mines. Gold Fields
currently holds 46% of St. Helena's equity.
Internet Bank Pushes Rate Envelope
Losing money has never been so popular. First there was EGG, the internet-banking unit of British insurer
Prudential PLC, which offered unusually high interest rates on savings accounts. Others followed. Now
First-E, a recently launched Internet bank, has gone one step further. Its new interest rate on savings
accounts, an aggressive 6.25%, is higher than the 6.00% being offered by EGG and well over the current
base rate of 5.25%. First-E -- the result of a joint venture between France's Banque d'Escompte and Enba, a
technology group -- isn't saying how much it expects to lose by aiming so high. Like other Internet-based
groups, First-E's strategy involves luring customers with attractive prices before trying to cross-sell other,
more lucrative banking services. Analysts warn that the arrival of high savings rates has brought with it a new
investor -- the "rate tart," as one described the breed -- who monitors weekly tables and switches his money
back and forth depending on which bank is offering the best returns.
BAA Results Cheer Analysts
Fiscal first-half earnings at BAA, the British operator of airports, showed that the deterioration of retail sales
because of the end of duty-free sales in Europe has stopped. BAA said its pretax profit before exceptional
items for the six months ended Sept. 30 was GBP 306 million ($503.5 million), compared with GBP 307
million in the first half of last year. Analysts had braced themselves for gloomy first-half figures after the
company issued a profit warning in early October. Duty- and tax-free shopping was scrapped in Europe at the
end of June, but BAA pledged to maintain duty-free prices for travelers within the European Union.

Uruguayan Center Left Advances
Uruguay's center-left Popular Front increased its share in Congress in elections on Sunday, becoming the

the 99-seat lower-house Chamber of Deputies to 40 from 31 seats and its forces to 12 senators instead of
nine in the 30-seat upper house. "The Popular Front is now absolutely necessary for laws which might require
the passage of two-thirds of the Congress, like naming judicial powers," said Oscar Botinelli, a political
analyst with Factum pollsters. The Popular Front's candidate Tabare Vazquez won 39% of the presidential

Batlle of the center-right, incumbent Colorado party.
Globo Unit Sets Brazilian Internet Launch
Brazilian pay-television provider Globo Cabo expects to launch its Virtua Internet service provider within the
next two weeks, pending regulatory approval. It will be Globo Cabo's first major project launch since the
company, a unit of media concern Globo Comunicacoes & Participacoes, sold an 11.5% stake to Microsoft, of
Redmond, Wash., in August for $126 million. Globo Cabo's two-way cable-modem service allows cable
customers to access the Internet at high speeds without tying up their phone lines. The company expects
Virtua to attract 50,000 subscribers in the first 12 months.
Pemex Official Is Sanctioned
Mexico banned an official of state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos from holding any public post for
10 years, after discovering contract irregularities. A watchdog agency said Miguel Angel Fuentes was found
to have simulated tender processes on contracts for the leasing of machinery and equipment at a Pemex
refinery in 1993 and 1994. There was no response from Pemex.

Redmond, Ore. -- As cows go, Wagyu are not much to look at. They're smaller than your ordinary cow, with a
narrow snout and a hide in basic black, rusty brown or variations thereof. But there's gold in them thar cows:
They're the Japanese breed that becomes Kobe beef. And if it weren't for the plentiful piles of manure and the
swarms of flies, I'd swear I was at Tiffany's.
But in fact I was surrounded by snow-capped mountains and rolling range at the central Oregon ranch owned
by R.L. and Susie Freeborn. Their company in nearby Bend (about 170 miles east of Portland), Kobe Beef
America Inc., is the only company to raise superior Japanese beef strictly for the American palate, but at
prices roughly half of the $120 or so that a pound of top-grade Kobe beef from Japan commands on the retail
market. The Freeborns had invited me to spend a weekend at the ranch to get a feel for the way of the
Wagyu in America, and by Sunday I had herded, inoculated and even artificially inseminated some of these
bovine gold mines.
Mr. Freeborn ("just call me R.L.") usually performs the insemination duty himself, with a priceless pipette of
what you might call liquid gold, and he takes his job seriously. "As Dr. Laura says, `I am my kids' dad,'" he
deadpans, eyes twinkling from under his cowboy hat. "Once I did 1,000 cows in one day. I called the
operation `The Love Boat.'"
He is on the board of directors of the American Wagyu Association, which now includes 55 ranchers devoted
to finding the perfect recipe, through genetics and feeding, for the heavily marbled, rich and flavorful beef that
is in such high demand in Japan. Most of the members are dedicated to propagating the breed; only about a
half-dozen raise the beef for export to Japan, and only Mr. Freeborn raises Wagyu specifically for the U.S.
market. Wagyu breeding has also taken off in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Europe.
Only a small percentage of Kobe beef, named for the city where the cattle were first bred 170 years ago,
reaches the pinnacle of Japan's lofty standards for the quantity and quality of intramuscular fat. There, the
highest grade of beef, a rarely achieved 12, is so smooth and rich it is likened to foie gras, or even butter, and
is usually served in thin slices that have been rapidly cooked in broth.
"Our customers don't want foie gras," says Mr. Freeborn, who caters to folks just wanting to sink their
choppers into a great steak. So with a Wagyu-Black Angus mix, raised without hormones and fed on barley,
he strives for a range of marbling that would rate from five to eight in Japan (still acceptable to most
Japanese diners). Measured by USDA standards his beef is off the charts, well above the top prime rating. By
comparison, normal prime cuts would be ranked no higher than three on the Japanese scale.
Although he treats his cattle lovingly, he draws the line at the sort of pampering some Japanese Wagyu
ranchers shower on their precious livestock. Personally, he thinks the massages (thought to relax the cattle --
not, as commonly believed, to work more fat into muscle) and the sake rubs (thought to beautify their hides)
are a waste of time and energy.
"There's absolutely no scientific data that shows that a 120-pound man rubbing a 2,000-pound steer makes
any difference," he opines. "But if it makes the guy who's rubbing the steer feel any better, I'm all for it."
A fourth-generation cattle rancher with experience exporting high-grade American beef to Japan, Mr.
Freeborn was invited to a 1992 Wagyu symposium in Texas by Washington State University's Animal
Sciences Department and then asked to participate in a study of Wagyu genetics that WSU had begun in
1989. The Pullman, Wash., scientists had determined that the propensity for high marbling was in the
Japanese cows' genes, and with cross-breeding they hoped to produce top-quality beef in America that would
fetch top dollar in Japan.

--- Page 78 ---
Page 78 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Mr. Freeborn sent his first Wagyu beef to market five years ago. Although he exports some beef to Japan
under the Wabei Beef label, he concentrates on the American market, where Kobe Beef America products
are sold to high-end restaurants and even to the White House through a network of 17 distributors. One of
them sells individual steaks online, for about $28 for an 8-ounce filet mignon and $35 for a 12-ounce New
York steak, at www.farm-2-market.com. Authentic Kobe beef from Japan is available for a king's ransom at
many U.S. restaurants, but an American Kobe steak will set you back only about 50 bucks.
With his beef commanding such high prices, Mr. Freeborn can afford to keep a relatively small herd of several
hundred cattle. They seemed like a whole bunch to me when I was in the middle of them, though, helping to
separate older calves from their mothers for inoculations and weaning. I was congratulating myself for being
such a good sport as I courageously (and somewhat squeamishly) administered the shots in the calves'
leathery necks, when Mr. Freeborn, after explaining the mechanics of artificial insemination, declared, "By
golly, that would be a good learning experience!"
He outfitted me in overalls and a plastic glove that extended to my shoulder. With a gulp, I followed Mr.
Freeborn's careful instructions until my arm was strangled from the elbow down by an exasperated cow's
internal muscles.
When I yelped, Mr. Freeborn nodded knowingly. "That's what we call `the wave.' It's our on-the-ranch
surfing."
For our last night together, R.L. and Susie cooked up an extraordinary spread. Mrs. Freeborn, who was a
California surfer girl until she met her future husband at a polo match (his previous claim to fame was being
Omar Sharif's stand-in for polo scenes in the 1975 film "Funny Lady"), went along with the joke of serving me
a potato-sized rock and watching me try to cut into it.
But all was forgiven when the steak came off the barbecue and I got to bite into this treasure trove of
tenderness and flavor. It made my toes curl up in my cowboy boots.

mixture of tight money and low taxes, promoted by Robert Mundell, winner of this year's Nobel Prize in
economics, has worked." I certainly can't argue with the tight money part of Mr. Westbury's argument. And, as
a fellow supply-sider, I certainly have no quarrel with his belief in the efficacy of low taxes in promoting
non-inflationary growth. But how can "low taxes" be working in an environment of high taxes?
Federal taxes currently consume about 23% of our nation's GDP, a record. Not a peacetime record, an
all-time record. That's right -- a greater share of a much larger GDP is being spent feeding the federal
spending machine than was spent defeating Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo. How can this be construed as a
low-tax environment? One could argue legitimately that marginal tax rates are way down from the 70% that
prevailed in 1980, but they are way up from the 28% that was instituted as the top rate in the Tax
Simplification and Reduction Act of 1988.
As a supply-sider, I agree that low taxes are conducive to, if not essential for, strong economic growth without
inflation. But also as a supply-sider, I marvel at how well our economy has done under a regime of high
taxes. Can the boost to the economy from lowering tax rates be so powerful and so long lasting that we are
still enjoying the residue of the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s? Perhaps. But one has to think that the tailwind
the economy has been enjoying from these tax reductions cannot last forever. It eventually has to be calmed
by the stultifying effects of the Bush/Clinton high-tax regime.
Taxes are at an all-time high. If one combines that fact with the supposition that gold's being up 18% over the
past three months is evidence that the Fed has perhaps been lax in its husbandry of the money supply of
late, one can easily see why the argument that stagflation could be imminent is gaining currency among
some of us supply-siders.

Dollar Sinks Against Yen on Weakness In Markets but Ends Flat Against Euro

NEW YORK -- The dollar lost ground against the yen as market declines in the U.S. caused investors to put
their money to work elsewhere.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 105.32 yen, down from 105.71 yen late Friday. The
euro was trading at $1.0675, little changed from $1.0692 at the end of last week.
Because the euro traded in a tight range against the dollar, most of the action took place in the dollar/yen
arena, according to analysts. "Three fundamental factors have taken the dollar down" yesterday, said Jeremy
Fand, foreign currency strategist at FleetBoston.
First, the realization that the Bank of Japan's monetary policy meeting, scheduled Wednesday, will not result
in changes in monetary policy helped stabilize expectations on trading levels of the yen, he said.
Second, talk of "pork barreling" agreements on the next fiscal-stimulus package by Tokyo's government
fueled expectations the yen will receive a fiscal boost soon.
Third, September's trade numbers for Japan, which showed the national surplus shrinking by about 10%,
confirmed that Japanese consumers are buying more imported goods, something good for the economy
there.
As a result, the dollar broke support of 105.45 yen on continued buying interest of Japanese currency ahead
of Wednesday's BOJ policy meeting. The next support is seen at 104.70 yen.
Meanwhile, the euro continued to trade in a tight range against the U.S. currency. Earlier in the day,
comments by European Central Bank Chief Economist Otmar Issing supported the euro, when he said he
saw risks changing from the downside to the upside.
Mr. Issing's comments have refocused attention on the possibility of a half-percentage-point interest-rate
increase on Nov. 4 and placed greater emphasis on the release of euro-zone M3 money supply data due out
later this week. But the euro's muted reaction gave weight to speculation that there is no broad-based
demand for the single currency ahead of the year end.
Adding to the mixed euro-zone scenario were recent inflation data coming out of Germany, which barely
showed any pickup in consumer prices other than the volatile energy sector, FleetBoston's Mr. Fand said.
In the short term, the euro is expected to trade range-bound against the dollar, with a bias for an upward
move on technical rebound. Resistance is pegged at $1.0720, and support is pegged at $1.0650, according
to analysts.
Yesterday was a better day for sterling and the Canadian dollar, which posted decent gains throughout the
day, said Andrew Busch, foreign currency trading director at Bank of Montreal in Chicago.
The British pound gained new ground on better prospects for the United Kingdom economy, Mr. Busch said.
Good economic data showing a narrowing trade deficit in both August and September pointed to a strong
recovery of U.K. manufacturing activities and exports. Late yesterday, sterling was quoted at $1.6640, up
from from $1.6567 Friday.
Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was supported by gold-related sales of Australian dollars against the
Canadian currency. The two currencies are sensitive to price swings of commodities such as gold, because
large parts of the Canadian and Australian economies rely on raw commodity exports. As a result, the two
currencies are often sold against each other in line with gold-price fluctuations.

Somewhere in dim memory, a representative of the City of London came to explain his plans to undermine
the dominance of Wall Street. Playfully asked how the U.S. could best protect its leadership in the world of
finance, his reply was instant: "Repeal Glass-Steagall."
In its wisdom, the U.S. government is finally on the verge of repealing the 1933 law that splintered the
business of finance, separating commercial banking from investment banking from insurance. The law
prohibited money-saving combinations, entrenched various monopolies and created a complex skein of
regulatory issues that impeded change. The splintering spirit of the 1930s also produced disasters-in-waiting,
such as the Savings & Loan and Farm Credit systems; the heart of financial security, we repeatedly and
painfully learned, is diversification.
In the dead of night Friday morning, our solons finally came to agreement on reversing the mistakes of their
predecessors. The final dispute came down to the "sunshine" provision of the Community Reinvestment Act,
under which regulators review whether banks have been lending enough in poor neighborhoods. Even
frivolous protests on CRA grounds can delay mergers or expansions, and banks have taken to paying
"community groups" to go away. Senator Gramm succeeded in inserting a provision that banks will have to
reveal such payments, and the groups will have to reveal how they spend the money. The Administration had
been threatening a veto to preserve shakedown opportunities for its political allies, until it apparently dawned
on someone that scuttling banking reform was no way to run for Senator from the state of New York.
This overtly political denouement to Glass-Steagall is entirely fitting, since it was originally cut from the same
cloth. It was passed in the depths of the Great Depression, in the wake of the great stock market crash 70
years ago this week. As Ron Chernow wrote in his "The House of Morgan": "Ultimately, Glass-Steagall was
as much an attempt to punish the banking industry as it was a measure to reform it. It was Main Street
striking back at Wall Street, rounding out the 1929 disaster."
More pointedly, it was the politicians making banks the scapegoats for the Depression. Franklin Roosevelt
proclaimed, "The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may
now restore that temple to the ancient truths." Senate Banking Committee hearings under counsel Ferdinand
Pecora looked in the nooks and crannies of banking for abuses, and predictably found some, such as the
House of Morgan cutting politicians and business allies into hot new issues. The point of Glass-Steagall was
not to make banks safe for depositors, but to limit their political power.
At this remove there is still debate over the true causes of the crash and the Depression. Mistakes in Federal
Reserve policy are now the most frequently cited cause, following Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz in
their "Monetary History of the United States." The Smoot-Hawley Tariff and Hoover's 1932 tax increase surely
did not help. And international finance was unable to digest the issues of war debts and reparations, or the
breakdown of the gold standard under wartime inflation. Without deciding the relative merit of these
explanations, they are not the province of private bankers but of politicians.
Events are the ultimate educator, we suppose, and time the universal solvent. Over recent decades industry
after industry, starting with airlines back during the Carter Administration, has been deregulated to the great
benefit of consumers. The illogic of a splintered financial industry has become increasingly manifest, leading
regulators and legislators to forge loopholes in the barriers erected in 1933. Simple repeal has been
repeatedly promised, but frustrated; the huge Citigroup merger was simply done assuming the law finally
would be repealed.
The declining market share of commercial banks gives lie to the fear of inordinate political power. They now
hold less than a quarter of U.S. financial assets, compared with more than half in the 1950s. Corporations
issue securities directly to the markets; mortgages are securitized. Households invest in mutual funds and
401(k) accounts. And competition now reaches across borders, from Wall Street to the City and beyond. In
the face of this, Glass-Steagall's splinters became unsustainable.

The remarkable thing, indeed, is that it took so long to perish. It takes a lot of time to dissolve a good
scapegoating.

Britain's Medeva
Confirms Talks
On Possible Deal
British pharmaceuticals company Medeva confirmed it is in discussions that may lead to an offer for the
company. It is the third time in recent months Medeva has been involved in merger talks. Medeva rejected
the previous bids, saying they didn't fairly value its drugs under development. A report yesterday in the
Sunday Times in London said the new suitor is Celltech Chiroscience of Britain.
In London trading Friday, Medeva shares closed up 17% at 166.5 pence ($2.79). Medeva said it will make a
further announcement to the London Stock Exchange when an outcome to the discussions becomes clear.
Boeing Chief Sees Deeper Europe Ties
The chairman of U.S. plane maker Boeing, Phil Condit, predicts the prospective transformation of European
aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie into a single company will be good for competition between the two
companies, and he expects Boeing will deepen its European ties in both civilian and military operations. Mr.
Condit also said Friday in Brussels that he expects to see greater cooperation between aerospace companies
on both sides of the Atlantic.
Deutsche Telekom, MediaOne Deal Set
Deutsche Telekom of Germany confirmed it will purchase cellular-phone assets in Poland, Hungary and
Russia from MediaOne Group of the U.S. for around $2 billion. The deal follows Deutsche Telekom's
purchase in August of One2One, the United Kingdom mobile-phone operator, from Cable & Wireless of the
U.K. and MediaOne, which is being acquired by AT&T of the U.S. The deal will double the German
company's 22.5% stake in Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, Poland's largest cellular-phone operator, to 45%.
Deutsche Telekom will also acquire MediaOne's 49% stakes in Westel Radiotelefon's Westel 450 and Westel
900 units, which control about two-thirds of Hungary's cellular market. Hungary's Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat,
or Matav, in which Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech of the U.S. own a combined 59.58% stake, has an
option to buy Deutsche Telekom's Westel stakes for $885 million during a 15-month period from next July.
Deutsche Telekom will also acquire a majority stake in Russian Telecommunications Development.
Krugerrand Exports to U.S. Resume
South Africa has resumed exports of gold Krugerrands to the U.S. The Rand Refinery said exports started
this month with a millennium coin, the Krugerrand 2000. More than 15 million ounces of Krugerrands were
exported to the U.S. from 1975 to 1985, before international sanctions against the former apartheid
government barred trade with South Africa. Rand Refinery is owned by the country's main gold-mining
companies.
BRIEFLY:
-- German electronics company Siemens confirmed it has sold its Nixdorf Retail & Banking Systems GmbH
unit to U.S. investors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and GS Capital Partners, the private equity arm of Goldman
Sachs Group, for 1.44 billion marks ($795.6 million).

-- European personal-computer sales surged 19.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier to 6.46 million
units, according to market-research firm Context.
-- Italy's government said it may boost the 12 billion euro ($12.97 billion) initial public offering of state electric
utility Enel because of heavy demand.
-- Telepizza said it plans to sell a 30% stake held by its chairman, Leopoldo Fernandez Pujals. It said Mr.
Fernandez will sell a 5.4% stake in Telepizza to fellow Spanish fast-food company TeleChef and will sell
another 25% in a public offering.
-- The European Commission blasted France for allowing rendering plants to sell sewage sludge to
animal-feed producers and ordered the government to crack down on anyone still engaged in the practice.
Britain's agriculture minister resisted calls to retaliate against France's continuing ban on British beef imports.
-- Swedish telecommunications group Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson reported pretax profit for the first nine
months of 1999 topped analysts' estimates. Pretax profit fell 35% from a year earlier to 7.91 billion Swedish
kroner ($973.3 million), above the 7.53 billion kroner forecast by analysts surveyed by SIX Market Estimates.
-- French industrial production rose 1.5% in July and August from June and was up 1.7% from output in the
year-earlier two months, the government said.
-- Britain's gross domestic product at constant market prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in the third

Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Lehman Discuss Tie
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi of Japan and Lehman Brothers of the U.S. are discussing a link in mergers and
acquisitions, including the possibility of setting up a joint mergers-acquisitions boutique in Japan, a person
familiar with the negotiations said. Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage firm, would benefit by
gaining access to Tokyo-Mitsubishi's Japanese corporate clients. Meanwhile, for Japan's biggest bank,
working with Lehman would add firepower to an M&A business that is strong in brokering deals between
Japanese firms but lags behind big Western investment banks in cross-border transactions.
Hyundai Group to Reduce Affiliates
South Korea's Hyundai Group unveiled the latest stage in its restructuring program, saying it plans to shrink
the total number of its affiliates to 32 from 46 by early next month through spinoffs, mergers and a liquidation.
The conglomerate also plans to shed an additional six units by the end of 1999 to complete its previously
announced plan to reduce its operations to 26 affiliates from 79, a Hyundai Group spokesman said Friday.
The group will spin off Chip Pac Korea, Transorient Shipping and Kia Intertrade and will liquidate Hyundai
Broadcasting System. Inchon Iron & Steel and Kia Electronics & Systems will be merged into other
companies. Creditor banks gave preliminary approval last week to Kangwon Industries' plan to merge with
Inchon Iron. The conglomerate also said it reached agreements to sell Hyundai Oil Refining, Diamond Ad,
Diamond Bates Korea, Kia Heavy Industries, Kia Precision Works, Korea Advanced Brake System and Kia
Motech. The group also plans to spin off Hyundai Sega Entertainment.
China Orders 28 Airbus Aircraft
China has ordered 28 aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie in a deal valued at about 15 billion francs ($2.47
billion), French President Jacques Chirac said Saturday. Mr. Chirac, traveling in France with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, said the order includes eight of Airbus's largest jet, the A340, and 10 each of its
smaller A318 and A319 aircraft. Mr. Jiang was in Lyon, on the second leg of a 17-day visit to Europe and the
Mideast.
BRIEFLY:
-- Japan's Nomura Securities reported fiscal first-half net profit of 54.73 billion yen ($516.5 million), compared
with a loss of 207.26 billion yen a year earlier. Nikko Securities, meanwhile, posted fiscal first-half net of
54.52 billion yen, compared with a net loss of 57.52 billion yen a year before.

Mexican Consumer Prices Rise 0.37%
Mexican consumer prices in the first two weeks of October were 0.37% higher than in the preceding two
weeks, the Bank of Mexico reported, indicating that the trend toward lower inflation appears to be continuing.
The rise was less than the 0.43% increase projected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.
Prices of products in the government's basic basket of goods rose 0.67%, the central bank said Friday.
Embraer Announcement Is Expected
Aircraft maker Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, asked the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange to halt
trading in its shares Friday, pending an announcement that could come as soon as today. Embraer has
acknowledged it is in talks with Dassault Aviation of France, British Aerospace and Sweden's Saab about a
possible partnership. A Sunday Times report yesterday in London said British Aerospace and Saab are set to
take a 20% stake in Embraer. There has also been speculation about a new jet.
Casa Autrey Reaches Debt Accord
Mexican pharmaceutical distributor Grupo Casa Autrey said Friday it reached a debt-restructuring agreement
that will result in a 50% reduction in bank obligations. The company, in a filing with the Mexican Stock
Exchange, said it will collect accounts receivable of about 1.18 billion pesos ($122.5 million) from related
companies Grupo Debir and Principia. The proceeds from Debir and Principia will be used to repay Autrey's
bank debt.
U.S. Funds Protest Mitsubishi Project
The managers of 15 U.S. mutual funds said they are joining a boycott against Mitsubishi of Japan to protest
the company's plans to build a new salt factory, in partnership with the Mexican government, on a Mexican
lagoon where gray whales give birth. The whales swim to the San Ignacio Lagoon on the Baja California
peninsula to breed. Supporters of the Mitsubishi boycott include Calvert Group, Citizens Funds, Crown
Futures, Domini Social Investments and Everest Asset Management.

Hutchison Accepts
Mannesmann Offer
For Orange Stake
Mannesmann shareholders slammed the German company's stock yesterday after its agreement to buy
British mobile-phone operator Orange for GBP 19.8 billion ($32.93 billion). But it's unlikely Mannesmann
holders will block the deal, which would extend the company's march across Europe. Its shares fell 8.2% to
144.8 euros ($155.62) each in Frankfurt. Hutchison Whampoa accepted Mannesmann's offer of $14.6 billion
for its controlling 44.8% stake in Orange, concluding one of the most lucrative transactions to date by an
Asian company. The deal will give Hong Kong-based Hutchison an equity interest of about 10% in
Mannesmann, allowing it to retain a stake in Orange and a foothold in the European telecommunications
market. Separately, Mannesmann said it will split off its engineering and automotive operations into a
separately listed company.
South Korea to Post 9% GDP Growth
State-run think tank Korea Development Institute said South Korea's gross domestic product should grow 9%
in 1999, marking an upward revision from its previous forecast in July of 7.5% growth and reflecting a sharp
rebound from last year's 5.8% contraction. In its quarterly outlook, KDI also said the country should post GDP
growth of 11.1% in the third quarter, contrasted with shrinkage of 7.1% a year earlier, and 10.4% growth in
the fourth quarter, compared with 5.3% contraction a year ago. KDI warned that structural problems still
remain in the corporate and financial sectors.
Sun of U.S. Launches Asia Java Fund
Hoping to capture investment opportunities in the region's fast-growing Internet industry, Sun Microsystems of
the U.S. launched its first venture-capital fund in Asia to promote innovation by companies using Sun's Java

EUROPE/AFRICA
EU Panel Clarifies Food-Labeling Rules
Attempting to clarify rules on what constitutes genetically modified food, a panel of European Union scientists
recommended that anything with more than 1% "GM" content be subject to a special labeling requirement.
Anything with less than 1% would be exempted. The clear majority support by the Scientific Committee on
Foods all but ensures formal adaption under EU law. The decision is seen as the beginning of the end of
more than a year of legal uncertainty during which food producers and retailers were required to label any
foods containing "GM" content as such but not given any threshold at which the labeling requirement would
kick in. The move could affect U.S. farm exports, many of which are genetically modified.
ICI Pretax Profit Rises Almost 53%
Imperial Chemical Industries posted better-than-expected profit in the third quarter, buoyed by robust trading
in its paints and specialty-chemicals businesses. ICI's paints operations increased profit 16%, while net
income at its core specialty businesses, which sell products such as adhesives, food starch and fragrances,
grew 10%. These core businesses helped ICI's pretax profit rise almost 53% to GBP 107 million ($178
million), from GBP 70 million, before good-will amortization and one-time items.
Anglogold Enters Fray for Ashanti
The battle for control of Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, Africa's third-largest gold producer, has become more
contested with South Africa's Anglogold, the world's biggest gold miner, saying it has entered the fray.
Anglogold, controlled by Anglo American, said it has been approached by Ashanti and has begun exploratory
talks with the financially troubled West African miner. Anglogold's interest is most likely confined to Ashanti's
800,000-ounces-a-year Obuasi mine in Ghana, an analyst said.
ECB Leaves Key Rates Unchanged
The European Central Bank, or ECB, left its main refinancing rate on loans to financial institutions at 2.5%,
overnight deposit rate at 1.5% and marginal lending rate at 3.5%. Separately, the Frankfurt-based bank said it
would nearly double the amount of money it will inject into the financial system in its last three refinancing
operations of 1999.

Venezuela's Chavez Criticizes Protests
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, in Singapore during an Asian tour, denounced protest marches at home
this week by thousands of government employees, who are demanding back pay and have threatened a
general strike next week. Workers say his administration has failed to pay nearly $4 billion in benefits owed
them since 1997, or a 20% pay raise that was approved in May. More than a million workers are expected to
join the demonstrations planned for Monday. Separately, the country may see a 2000 budget deficit
equivalent to 4.8% of gross domestic product, according to a report from the Central Bank, whose officials
weren't available to confirm the report.
Telmex Enjoys Strong Third Quarter
Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, the country's dominant phone carrier, said third-quarter net income was

Which Fund Is Low-Risk? So Far, None of Above

Lots of fund investors want it all: Great performance when the market is going up (like earlier this week). And
protection when the market is tumbling (like yesterday and last week).
Where to find that perfect type of mutual fund? "It's in the same place as the pot [of gold] at the end of the
rainbow," says Harold Evensky, a Coral Gables, Fla., financial adviser. "It's just not there."
Market-matching performance in good times is as easy as buying an index fund, of course. But on the
cautious side, market action this year is a reminder of the shortage of sure-fire safe havens for people
investing in stocks.
Remember how "value" funds, which invest in cheap, unloved stocks, were supposed to drop less than other
funds in a market downturn? That premise sounded reasonable because value stocks were already
seemingly low in price.
Well, value funds have certainly disappointed investors lately -- as they did in last year's summer downturn as
well. Since the July 16 peak in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, value funds tracked by Lipper Inc. are
down substantially more than "growth" funds that invest in the stocks of fast-growing companies.
Among "multicap" funds that buy stocks of various sizes, for instance, the average multicap value fund
tumbled 12.8% from mid-July through Wednesday, while the average multicap growth fund was down 6.09%.
Multicap value funds are down an average 2.1% this year through Wednesday, while multicap growth funds
are up 12.68%.
Some other supposedly low-risk types of stock funds have also disappointed safety-seeking investors this
year. Real-estate funds, which seemed cheap and relatively safe after a horrendous 1998, have fallen further
this year. Market-neutral funds, complex vehicles that were supposed to deliver decent returns in good
markets and bad, have mostly gone down.
Investors have to accept that "there are no safe harbors" in the stock market, says Tim Medley, a Jackson,
Miss., financial adviser. Rather, he says, investors who buy stocks -- because their returns have trounced
those of other alternatives over time -- have to be prepared to "muddle through bad situations" and sit tight
until the market turns up once again.
Investors should focus on "safe investing" rather than elusive havens, Mr. Evensky says. Like most advisers,
he says the key is spreading one's money among diverse types of securities to get strong long-term results
with the least risk possible. As stock prices have slumped recently, for instance, one fund that has shined for
Mr. Evensky's clients is Oppenheimer Real Asset Fund, a formerly bottom-of-the-charts performer that
invests in commodity-linked securities. That fund is up 29% this year through Wednesday, after tumbling 45%
in 1998.
As investors weigh their options in a rocky market, they can find a few stock funds that have used unusual
strategies to deliver solid if unspectacular returns with sharply reduced risk. Two such funds are Merger
Fund, which invests in companies engaged in already announced corporate combinations with the idea of
profiting when the transactions are completed, and Gateway Fund, which buys stocks and sells
corresponding call options. Both funds have average annual returns in the past decade of just over 10%,
compared with nearly 17% for the S&P 500 index, according to Morningstar Inc. (Merger Fund is closed to
new investors.)
Another option that may appeal to some investors: "bear-market" funds, which do well in down periods such
as the past few months. But such funds, essentially a bet that stock prices will decline, aren't a safe haven --
not, that is, unless investors know when a down period is beginning and when it is ending. Over longer

periods of time, when the stock market has been rising, funds such as Prudent Bear Fund and Rydex Ursa
Fund have been bottom-of-the-charts performers.
Here's a further look at a few of the stock-fund categories investors have looked to as those elusive safe
havens:
Value funds: Martin Whitman, manager of Third Avenue Value Fund, attributes the weak performance of
value funds to two factors. Those are investors' love affair with Nifty Fifty-type big growth stocks and "the
really unprecedented flight to garbage," such as Internet stocks with no earnings and questionable prospects.
"I can't attempt to outperform garbage," he says.
Third Avenue Value's performance is flat this year after a 4% advance in 1998. Investors have pulled out in
droves, leaving the fund with $1.3 billion in assets, down from $2 billion at the beginning of the year.
While value funds haven't proven a safe haven in this growth-focused market, supporters say they may
outperform growth funds going forward, as they have over some other periods of time. Mr. Whitman, for
instance, is enthusiastic about "a tremendous amount of bargains" in industries including insurance, real
estate and pharmaceuticals.
Real-estate funds: These funds invest in property-related stocks, including realestate investment trusts,
securities whose appeal for conservative investors includes hefty dividend yields averaging around 8%.
Despite generally positive conditions in the real-estate business, though, realestate securities have been in a
slump. The average real-estate fund is down 6.7% this year, after a negative 15.52% return last year,
according to Lipper.
As with value funds, the managers of real-estate funds say the dismal results will give way to strong
performance somewhere down the road. "These stocks are cheap, and they can't keep growing their
earnings and seeing their stock prices drop," says Andrew Davis, manager of the $350 million-in-assets Davis
Real Estate Fund.
Another reason to buy real-estate securities and funds is the hope that they will perform like actual real
estate, rather than like other stocks, over time -- thereby diversifying a portfolio. But some financial advisers
don't buy that argument. While tangible property may be a distinct asset class, real-estate securities don't
merit a special spot in people's portfolios, Mr. Medley says.
Market-neutral funds: These funds split their assets between purchases of promising stocks and "short sales"
of other stocks expected to be lagging performers. (In a short sale, an investor sells borrowed shares of a
stock with the hope of replacing those shares later with ones bought at a lower price.) In theory, balancing
long and short positions will "neutralize" the effect of the market's overall direction and deliver decent, low-risk
returns.
The reality, though, hasn't been impressive. Since the first fund, Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral Fund,
appeared in late 1997, for instance, it has delivered a negative 12.33% return, according to Lipper. One
problem: A number of market-neutral funds tend to buy value stocks and sell short growth stocks -- a costly
strategy in the recent growth-happy market. While this has been a tough period, market-neutral investing "has
a proven track record" in the past decade, says David Katzen, manager of Phoenix-Euclid Market Neutral
Fund.
Assets of the funds have declined, as some early buyers have lost faith. Mr. Evensky says he gave up on
market-neutral funds in February, selling positions that approached 5% of clients' portfolios.

President Trump's inaugural address:
My fellow Americans,
This is a great day for me personally. You're very smart to have voted for me because I'm going to do positive
things for this country, starting with this mall I'm looking out over. For starters, I don't know why this is called a
"mall." Where I come from, New York City -- which happens to be the greatest city in the world, and the
reason I say that is that I built most of it, and I only build quality, so I think I know what I'm talking about -- a
mall doesn't look like this. Where are the shops? I see grass, ponds, an obelisk. This is not Cairo.
I don't know how much the government paid for the Washington Monument -- and I have no problem with
George Washington, but he wasn't a businessman -- they overpaid. You've got a 560-foot tall structure sitting
on some of the most prime real estate in the country, incredible views, including of my new home. People
would pay a lot for a duplex co-op in a building like that. I would charge fifteen hundred, two thousand dollars
a square foot, and I'd get it. No wonder this government is trillions in debt.
Everywhere I look I see wasted opportunities, and I've only been president for five minutes. At the end of this
so-called mall is the Lincoln Memorial. Lincoln was a good president, but I would have freed the slaves, too.
And I would have given them something more useful than 40 acres and a mule, incidentally. But if you want
to make a statement about Lincoln, you could do much better than this. White marble? Columns? This is not
Greece. And that statue, he looks like he's enduring a difficult bowel movement. This is no way to say thank
you for saving the union. And I know about unions, believe me. Ask around. And don't try offering them 40
acres and a mule. So with respect to Lincoln, I would make a statement: pink marble, gold, mirrors, maybe
some hanging gardens, fountains with water coming out the breasts. People like that. A restaurant on the roof
that would serve excellent food, because that's the only kind of food I'm interested in. Mediocre food doesn't
interest me. You know what people like? The big shrimp.
So what do you think of your new first lady? I picked Moronia here -- from a very wide selection of possibilities
-- because this nation wants a trophy first lady. They want a trophy. When everyone sees the first lady
standing next to some other first lady of another country, the wife of a premier -- whatever -- they'll want to go
to bed with our first lady, not the other one. So the American people no longer have to worry on that score.
And if they get tired of her, it's not a problem, because chances are I'll be tired of her before they are. And we
get a new first lady. Trying to keep North Korea from getting the bomb, maybe that's a problem. Finding a
new first lady will not be a problem.
As far as policy goes, I'm going to be very hands-on. If a situation comes up, like inflation, or a union beef, or
if Mike Tyson beats up another motorist, I'm going to be on top of it. It's going to be fixed. There was a skating
rink in New York City in Central Park. There were problems with it. I got involved. Now people can skate on it.
It's not that complicated.
With foreign policy, the same. I'm a businessman. Other countries want to do business with us, I'm all for it.
Trade, great. I have no problems with people trading with us, but it's going to be fair trade, by which I mean
we come out on top. Or they can sell their TVs and cheeses to someone else. Maybe North Korea could use
them. Again, it's not complicated. Missiles? Very simple -- you aim one at us, I fire 100 at you. So don't go
there. The idea of turning a country into a radioactive parking lot, that doesn't bother me. I sleep fine. Ask
Moronia. And finally on the foreign front, I have something to say to Fidel Castro. Adios, pal. This time, we're
going to nationalize your hotels and casinos.
That about covers it. I have to go, because the important senators and congressmen are giving me a lavish
luncheon in the rotunda. I understand they're serving a lot of shrimp, much better food than they've had in
Congress for a long time. Basically they're trying to impress me so I won't cancel their highway projects and
ethanol subsidies. I know how they do things. Now they're going to find out how I do things.

By the way, I've directed the Treasury to issue a couple billion extra in $100 chips. Enjoy yourselves. It's the
dawn of a very great era.

In late 1997 and late 1998, investors stampeded out of stocks, sending blue chips down 13% and 19%,
respectively, and dealing the 1990s bull market its worst setbacks to date. But, on both occasions, share
prices quickly rebounded and went on to set records.
Once again it is October, and once again stocks have skidded. But the correction is different this time around
-- different enough to cast doubt on whether a quick return to new highs is in the cards.
The difference is that turmoil abroad and panic in the debt markets at home fueled the pullbacks of 1997 and
1998. Both times, the Federal Reserve stood ready to help. This time, plain, old-fashioned worries about
inflation ignited the sell-off. And inflation's record as a killer of bull markets is unmatched.
Even with yesterday's benign consumer-price report and the accompanying relief rally, investors have plenty
of reasons to fret. Oil prices have doubled in the past year, gold has leapt from the doldrums to more than
$300 an ounce, wholesale prices for last month registered their biggest gain in nine years, and to top it all off,
there is the perception -- right or wrong -- that the Fed wants this correction to happen.
During the 1997 and 1998 crises, Bruce Kendall, a Houston engineer and investor, either loaded up on stocks
or stood pat. But this year, after the Fed twice raised rates, gold rallied and bond yields climbed, he
concluded, "We've got a problem here." A few weeks ago, after consulting with some fellow investors, he sold
about 30% of his $100,000-plus stock portfolio in just two days. "The Asian and Russian crises were crises of
confidence," he says. "This is a little different: inflation coming back up and the Fed raising rates to combat
it. It's a little more real this time."
Yet for all that intensity of feeling, rising inflation remains just a fear, not a fact. Many of the forces that have
kept inflation in check -- from rising productivity to muted pay gains -- remain in place. Yesterday's closely
watched consumer-price report, in contrast to Friday's producer-price report, was exactly as expected.
Indeed, economists say it showed that the "core" inflation rate -- which strips out the most volatile
componentshas actually slowed in the past year to 1.9% from 2.4%
Though shares rose sharply yesterday morning, reflecting investors' relief that, as expected, inflation wasn't
out of control, stocks gave back much of their gains in afternoon trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,
after rising 219.09 points, fell back to close at 10204.93, for a much more modest advance of 88.65 points --
and is still down 9.9% from its August peak. The industrial average finished last week 11.5% off its peak, thus
handily meeting Wall Street's rule of thumb for a correction -- a 10% or greater decline in value. The Nasdaq
Composite Index, meanwhile, fell 0.97 point on Tuesday to 2688.18, after rising 40.15 points in early trading;
it is now off 7.8% from its all-time high, reached last week.
The market's tepid response underscores the fact that stocks respond to expectations, not just reality. And if
expectations of a resurgence in inflation prove to be well-founded, price stability -- one of a remarkable set of
ingredients that have lifted stock prices threefold since the end of 1994 -- would be removed from the mix.
"The fundamentals really are changing," says Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch.
"The story in the financial markets during the past several years was disinflation," or a declining inflation
rate, "then deflation," or falling prices, he says. "We think the next story will be inflation."
To many on Wall Street, the 1997 and 1998 retreats didn't feel like a bear market at the time because the
traditional bear-market factors weren't in place. The economic crisis overseas, far from hurting the U.S.
economy, ultimately helped it by driving down the cost of commodities and imported goods, thereby
suppressing inflation and creating the climate for lower interest rates. By contrast, almost every bear

--- Page 96 ---

market in the past 50 years has begun with inflation pressure and a sharp increase in interest rates by the
Federal Reserve, often tipping the economy into recession.
Even if inflation is on the way back, it wouldn't necessarily bring on a bear market, generally defined as a
sustained drop of 20% or more in blue-chip stocks. For example, in 1994, the Fed raised interest rates
sharply to head off potential inflation, but stocks finished the year roughly flat. Indeed, many investors now
stand ready to buy when they think the correction has run its course. "I expect the decline will continue until
early November, and at that point I may purchase some shares," says Herbert Madsen, a retired computer
programmer who lives near San Antonio. And Mr. Kendall, the Houston investor, is preparing to buy back
some of the shares of Lucent Technologies Inc. he sold just a few weeks ago.
But a return of inflation would still test many of the assumptions that have taken the market to levels almost
unimaginable five years ago. And, if stocks are indeed a speculative bubble, an inflation scare might be just
what it takes to burst it.
From the end of 1994 to its peak of 11326 in August, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 7,500
points, or 195%. Rising corporate earnings accounted for roughly half of that gain. The remainder reflected
the rising price investors were willing to pay for each dollar of earnings, that is the price-earnings ratio. That
rising ratio reflected several factors: increased confidence that earnings growth wouldn't be interrupted by
recession, a perception that stocks weren't as risky as they used to be, and perhaps most important,
confidence that inflation wouldn't erode the value of future profits.
Ironically, the stock market itself has emerged as a candidate to undermine the foundation of its own success.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making body, fretted at their August
meeting that stocks' "sharp rise and the associated increase in wealth over the course of recent years [has]
helped to foster a high level of consumer confidence and willingness to spend," according to the minutes of
that meeting. Economists believe consumers usually spend some portion of any new wealth, and some argue
that's just why the savings rate has turned negative and a consumption binge now is threatening to drive up
wages and prices.
The Fed is thus in a position opposite to where it stood during the previous corrections. By late 1997, as one
Asian economy after another succumbed to financial panic, the Fed dropped the bias toward rate-tightening
that it adopted earlier in the year. In the fall of 1998, after Russia's default provoked a crippling freeze in U.S.
credit markets, the Fed slashed interest rates 0.75 percentage point. By contrast, this year it has raised
rates 0.5 percentage point, in effect taking back most of last fall's easing, and two weeks ago it said its bias
now was toward raising rates further, rather than leaving them alone.
Far from fretting over the market's tumble, the Fed is "secretly cheering," says Credit Suisse First Boston
economist Rosanne Cahn. "In order for the economy to slow, stock prices have to go down and stay down."
If an unfriendly Fed is viewed as putting a lid on the Dow Jones industrials somewhere north of 11000, then it
is also likely that investors' ingrained "buy-the-dips" mentality forms a floor somewhere, as well. In the middle
of last year's sell-off, the Dow industrials briefly were down 20% from their peak, but when they touched 7400,
a wave of buying brought them back. At present, while mutual-fund managers are low on cash, individual
investors, who often have shown greater faith in stocks than professionals, hold plentiful money-market
funds. But will they put that cash to work?
Earlier this year, Don Nightingale, 65, a mergers-and-acquisitions consultant in St. Paul, Minn., shifted his
portfolio to 60% stocks from 100%, putting the balance in money-market funds, and he has resisted adding
anew to his stock holdings. The investor, who says he made the shift because of his age, describes himself
as "paranoid about inflation. I lived through the late '70s and '80s and watched the purchasing power of the
dollar evaporate so much. I'm getting ready to go into my golden years and obviously that's a high concern."
The perception that the Fed is ready to knock the market back every time the Dow Jones industrials pop up is
earning it a great deal of enmity among small investors. "Improper and arrogant" is how Mark Longhi, an
investor and former business owner in Tucson, Ariz., describes Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's warnings
about the stock market in an online forum moderated by The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition.
In July he put 60% of his three children's college money "into good quality blue-chip stocks, and they're
getting creamed." He doesn't see the inflation threat. He says that when he went shopping for a Chevrolet
Camaro for his college-age daughter the other day, he found it priced $3,000 below a lesser-powered Nissan
Altima he leased three years ago.
But Mr. Longhi also doesn't believe you can "fight the Fed."
"He's got me scared," says Mr. Longhi, speaking of Mr. Greenspan. "You never know when he's going to
open his mouth again."

Despite such sentiments, the Fed says it isn't trying to pop a stock-market bubble. But it is concerned about
inflation -- in part stemming from the elevated value of assets, such as stocks -- and some economists say
that the end result is similar: higher interest rates that have the effect of damping stock prices.
However, some Fed officials continue to sound ebullient about the inflation outlook, despite the central
bank's "tightening bias." Last week, Edward Boehne, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,
said he expects "relatively low inflation for the coming year at least, and probably longer." And Jack Guynn,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said at a conference on financial crises Monday that even
though stocks have more effect on the economy than they used to, Wall Street is overstating their influence
on Fed thinking.
But Wall Street continues to perceive stocks as an inflationary threat that could prompt Fed action. "You have
this weird circularity," says William Dudley, head of U.S. economic research at Goldman Sachs. "The stock
market is going down because they're worried about the Fed tightening, but if the stock market goes down,
the Fed won't tighten, so the stock market will go up. There's no sustainable equilibrium."
In its August minutes, FOMC members said, "The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should
recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of
consumer spending."
But there may be other reasons for the Fed to tighten credit, such as rebounding prices of goods and
services in many previously beaten-down sectors. A year ago, just 20% of the sectors surveyed by Prudential
Securities economists were raising prices, while 47% were cutting them. By the last quarter, 44% were
raising prices, and 26% were cutting them. Surveys by the National Association of Purchasing Management
also find that for the first time in years, members find more prices rising than falling.
But investors have seen such scares before, and they came to nothing. The market underwent a brief
pullback in the first quarter of 1997 when the Fed raised rates one-quarter of a percentage point as a
pre-emptive move on inflation. Stocks turned course when those inflation fears came to naught and went on
to new highs.
Even now, signs of deflation still are evident. One of the factors that has fueled the stock-market correction
was a disappointing profit report last week from Intel Corp., partly the result of a price war raging between it
and rival Advanced Micro Devices in low-priced microprocesssor chips.
Many analysts such as Mr. Bernstein think the real victims of the current inflation scare won't be stocks in
general, but rather the "Nifty 50" blue-chip growth stocks in the Dow industrials and Standard & Poor's 500
stock index that have led the market for the last year and a half while the average stock has struggled.
Because inflation's effect compounds over time, its retreat has been most beneficial for growth stocks,
whose biggest profits are years away.
For his part, Mr. Kendall, the Houston investor, sees the correction as simply "a readjustment to the levels we
were at before the Asia crisis. I still believe we're in a bull market. I'm getting ready to buy back in."
Even the inflation-phobic Mr. Nightingale calls inflation "just one of another" set of things "you try to look at.
The stock market is always an irrational beast. It's more irrational than normal."

Deutsche Telecom Loses on Polish Ruling
In the latest salvo in a high-profile battle with Deutsche Telekom over Poland's biggest mobile-phone
operator, Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, or PTC, Polish conglomerate Elektrim announced that a Polish court
rejected the German telephone giant's request to block registration of a share purchase that would give
Elektrim a controlling 51% stake in PTC. Deutsche Telekom said it would take the dispute to a Vienna
international arbitration court. Until the contested purchase, Elektrim held 34% in PTC. Telekom and Media
One International each hold 22.5%; the rest is held by small shareholders. In late May, Elektrim announced
plans to buy an additional 15.8% of the company from small shareholders.
La Caixa Buys Stake in Deutsche Bank
Spanish savings bank Caja de Ahorros & Pensiones de Barcelona, or La Caixa, said it bought a 2.6% stake
in Deutsche Bank. A La Caixa spokeswoman said the purchase, which was valued at about 150 billion
pesetas ($975.6 million), wasn't a business alliance with Germany's largest bank, but rather a "stable"
financial maneuver. La Caixa is also seeking to raise its Deutsche Bank stake to 3%, according to Spain's El
Pais newspaper. By raising its holding to 3%, La Caixa would become one of Deutsche Bank's majority
shareholders, the paper said. The La Caixa spokeswoman declined to comment on the article.
Benetton Group Likely to Win Control
A group led by the Benetton family is likely to take control of Autostrade, Europe's biggest toll-highway
company, after the Italian government sells a 2.6 billion euro ($2.81 billion) stake in a private placement next
week, people familiar with the matter said. That consortium is the only one to have bid for the entire 30% that
the government is seeking to place, offering just above the current market price, they said. The only rival
group, led by Australia's Macquarie Bank, failed to gather enough investors and filed a bid for a stake of less
than 10%.
Rover Cars Unveils Two New Models
Five years after Bayerische Motoren Werke took it over, Britain's Rover Cars faces the moment of truth.
Rover, which has lost money since BMW acquired it, unveiled two new models at the London Motor Show
that, combined with the sales launch of the executive-class Rover 75 last summer, amount to a total
makeover of its main models. For the first time, the full impact of billions of marks in BMW investment and a
massive dose of German know-how will be at work for the company that must now prove it can compete in
what has become a savage European car market.
ST Microelectronics' Net Rises 33%
Spurred by efficiency gains and the semiconductor industry's recovery, Franco-Italian chip maker ST
Microelectronics posted a 33% rise in net income for the third quarter. The company earned $135.3 million in
the period, from $101.6 million last year. Revenue rose 22.6% to $1.3 billion. The company is adding
chip-making capacity in its factories in Rousset, France, and Agrate, Italy, that will come on line in early 2000.

ASIA/PACIFIC
Report on Thai Bank's Loans Stirs Ire
A panel appointed by Thailand's government to investigate ailing Krung Thai Bank said an earlier auditor's
report exaggerated the bank's financial difficulties, but opposition politicians criticized the group's account as
a whitewash. In a report submitted to the Cabinet, the five-person panel led by a former central- bank
governor, Kamchorn Sathirakul, said Krung Thai's burden of nonperforming loans, though huge, aren't as bad
as suggested by Pricewaterhouse-Coopers in an internal report. The auditors, in a preliminary assessment
based on a sample of loans, had estimated the bank's bad loans could amount to 84% of total lending.
China Telecom Proceeds With Offering
Despite adverse global market conditions, China Telecom (Hong Kong) launched its international roadshow,

Ecuador to Begin
Debt Negotiations
With Bondholders
Ecuadorean finance officials are expected to arrive in New York next week to begin talks with holders of the
country's sovereign debt. Peter Allen, an independent consultant to a group of bondholders, said Ecuador is
planning to create a broad creditor group with which it will discuss the restructuring. The newly formed
Ecuador Creditors Advisory Group, which Mr. Allen advises, will have a seat on the larger body, he said. Last
month, Ecuador went into formal default on $1.4 billion in discount Brady bonds. Ecuadorean officials have
said they will seek to restructure about $6 billion in Brady bonds, but haven't presented investors with a
proposal or held detailed restructuring talks.
Bondholders say they are eager to begin negotiations, but that so far they have had little formal contact with
Ecuadorean officials. A legal adviser to Ecuador couldn't be reached for comment. Talks with creditors could
become more complicated if Ecuador makes a $27 million Eurobond payment due Monday, since the current
bondholder group is demanding that the Andean nation give equal treatment to all foreign bonds. Separately,
Ecuador's central bank on Friday canceled $36 million in loans outstanding with multilateral institutions,
people familiar with the matter said.
Mexico Sets New Rules for Banks

Mexico's top financial watchdog agency said it has introduced new accounting criteria for banks and loan-loss
provisioning rules for credit-card operations. The measures implemented by the National Banking and
Securities Commission, or CNBV, are part of efforts to bring the country's fragile banking system closer in line
with international standards. CNBV said accounting criteria involve the transfer of financial assets,
securitizations, related party transactions and the disclosure of information of operational segments. Banks
will be required to set provisions on a monthly basis, using billing information for the past nine months and
based on five risk levels. Loan-loss provisions will be based on the number of missed payments.
Barrick to Develop Tanzania Gold Mine
Canada's Barrick Gold said it plans a $280 million gold mine development in northwestern Tanzania, south
of Lake Victoria. The gold producer said its plans call for the Bulyanhulu mine, which it acquired as part of its
purchase in March of Sutton Resources, to start production in early 2001. The mining concern said it expects
the Bulyanhulu property to make a "strong contribution" to production, earnings and cash flow from the very
start. Barrick said it expects to double gold reserves to eight million ounces, from four million ounces.
BRIEFLY:
-- Colombia's state oil company Ecopetrol said it is about to sign an agreement to let its Venezuelan
counterpart, Petroleos de Venezuela, distribute gasoline in Colombia.
-- Ramon Yulee, one of Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad's closest and most powerful aides, resigned
from his post, a government official said.

Somehow we doubt too many money managers or even day-traders are heavily into sky-diving. You jump out
of an airplane and let your body go into a downward free-fall, trusting yourself to pull the parachute cord at
the right time. Everyone who does it says it's fun. But your body is one thing, your net worth something else.
And with the market off 5.92% last week, and despite yesterday's 96 point recovery, a lot of earthbound
traders are getting aggrieved that Alan Greenspan hadn't pulled the interest-rate cord for them earlier. Now
they're worried it's "too late," that inflation is loose and they're headed for a fall.
It's not overwhelmingly clear to us that inflation's back. Maybe the wholesale price jump was only a blip. But
bond traders, like canaries in a coal mine, are worth watching. There are enough worrisome signs around that
this is a good moment to start thinking seriously about what's beyond the economic horizon for the U.S.
economy. Robert Mundell, the supply-side economist who just won the Nobel Prize, already has the near
term in mind. Interviewed last week he said, "I don't see any indication of a slowdown in the U.S. economy in
the present, but I would not be surprised if that occurred next year."
Now when we say serious thinking about the near term, that includes Presidential candidates who will be
running full tilt next year. What if inflation indeed shows up and the Fed feels impelled to tighten, even at risk
of a downturn during the election campaign? If the person heading for the White House inherits a stalling U.S.
economy, voters will want an answer. The answer isn't, "I plan to stay within the spending caps." That's a
Beltway thing; it's not an economic strategy.
A real economic strategy is aimed at boosting the real economy, whose state of health is anticipated by stock
and bond markets. In this world, what one watches are prices, which direct goods and investments to their
most productive uses. Inflation disincentivizes that process, and the concern of late is that some relevant
prices have been blipping upward.
The price of oil, for instance, has more than doubled the past 12 months, owing in great part to the
oil-producing nations' ability this time to hang together on prices. They're helped by a number of factors, such
as the participation of Mexico. But OPEC's success can also be read as a sign of accommodative monetary
policies.
It's also true that at about $314, gold, another traditional price barometer, has suddenly surged from its
relatively long period of calm at around $250, sending short-sellers scurrying. The dollar has softened, and
some inflation also seems to be showing up in the September wholesale price report. While we've been
critical of the notion that the Fed should tighten because of rapid growth or low employment, the actual price
signals now command more attention.
The signals are far from conclusive, and no matter what the gyrations in stock, we are still clearly a long way
from affecting the real economy. Still, if the inflation threat turns real, the Fed may well tighten. That's
monetary policy's proper role -- keeping the price level steady. But tightened money can indeed slow an
economy. What, Mr. Presidential candidate, will you do then?
Our answer, and the answer that worked in the far worse stagflation of the 1980s, is to offset tighter money
with an incentive-boosting cut in marginal rates of taxation on taxpayers' incomes. How will this play
politically?
If next year the economy is at all slowing, Al Gore and Bill Bradley will be helpless. Both are hostage to their
party's longstanding dogma that income-tax cuts "benefit the rich." This has been politically potent, but is
economically inane. JFK could propose tax cuts to ease a recession, but 20 years later, George Mitchell
expunged this tool from Democratic policy for reasons of rank political expediency. Now the party's
candidates have to live with this shibboleth.

--- Page 102 ---
Page 102 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
A GOP candidate, meanwhile, will have a fat target: the 1991 Clinton tax increase, which in toto increased the
top marginal rate by about a third; with some state and local rates added, some rates have topped 50%. Last
week when a reporter put the subject of tax policy to Bob Mundell, he replied: "My own view is that reducing
taxes is the best way we have to keep the boom going: You need two tools, not just monetary policy but tax
policy."
But most politicians, including most Presidential aspirants, still think the Federal Reserve wholly controls the
success of the U.S. economy through interest rates. No, monetary policy, or a stable price level, is just the
half of it. Congress, with the President, directly controls the economy's productive incentives by setting the
nation's tax level.
We're not predicting recession here, but only the unwise man remains oblivious to inflation's signals. It's not
too early for serious politicians to start thinking about the tax cuts that would be their responsibility should the
economy stall in the middle of a Presidential campaign.

After the worst week for stocks of the past decade, gallows humor is in vogue again on Wall Street: Time to
break out those "Dow 10000" caps, the traders say; we could be using them more than once.
They are talking about the blue baseball caps handed out on the New York Stock Exchange floor back in
March, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average first went through the landmark 10000 level. Now, like a
modern-day Wrong Way Corrigan, the aviator who departed from New York in 1938 for California and wound
up in Ireland, the blue-chip index is flirting with 10000 again, this time from the wrong direction.
Once again, investors are debating: Is this a momentous event, or is it just a number? The answer: It may be
just a number, but it is a big, round one that is sending a chill down people's spines. When the blue-chip index
sank briefly below 10000, to 9998.18, about an hour before the close, a roar of pain erupted on the exchange
floor, followed by a roar of relief when the industrials quickly pushed back into five-digit territory.
At the end of the day, the blue chips sank 266.90 points, or 2.59%, to 10019.71. It was the steepest in point
terms in more than a year, since Aug. 31, 1998, and the heaviest in percentage terms since Oct. 1 of last
year.
But more significant, the Dow industrials recorded their worst-ever point drop for a calendar week, falling
630.05 points from Monday through Friday. It was the heaviest weekly percentage drop in 10 years, since
October 1989.
Further, the index is down 11.53% from its Aug. 25 record of 11326.04. A fall of 10% or more often is
described as a "correction."
People re-evaluate things when such a prominent index revisits such a special milestone as 10000. At best,
they decide stocks are cheap. At worst, they decide the market will get worse before it gets better. Moreover,
bad Fridays in the past sometimes have been followed by worse Mondays -- and sometimes by big Monday
rebounds.
This bull market has taken more than one analyst by surprise, of course. But bearish analysts, who long have
considered the stock market overvalued, are saying that this drop is finally the sign that the bull market is
over.
"The level itself, the number itself, doesn't mean anything," says Tim Hayes, senior stock strategist at Ned
Davis Research in Venice, Fla. "It is the attention given to the level that has an impact on the market. As you
break through 10000 again, the recognition that we are in a down trend becomes more pronounced, and the
recognition that we are in a bear market gets more pronounced."
Nonsense, say the bulls. That was wrong before, and it will be wrong again. The most fervent bulls say stocks
aren't going to close below 10000 at all. They note that stocks bounced right back when they fell below 10000
on Friday as buyers stepped in.
But even some bullish analysts say that the stock market still doesn't look cheap. It got ahead of itself this
year, they say, and it may have to fall below 10000 before buyers really step in.
"The market certainly isn't at great risk anymore now," says PaineWebber investment strategist Edward
Kerschner, a longstanding bull, but it only has fallen back to fair value. "It just isn't cheap yet," he says. "We
have to be down to a level between 9000 and 9500 before it begins to be attractive value." He is forecasting
that the industrials will finish the year little better than they are now. In the interim, he cautions, they could go
even lower, which would be "a great time to buy."

Over the weekend, millions of stockholders were asking themselves what, if anything, to do about the market
drop; how they answered the question will help determine where stocks go from here.
Some active traders are getting discouraged. Christine Hobson, who trades stocks full time from home in
Santa Clara, Calif., says she made $600 Friday buying beaten-down stocks early in the day and selling them
within an hour, before the market's steepest drop. But over a recent three-week period, she lost between
$12,000 and $14,000, she says. "I cannot make money, basically," she adds, although she says she still is up
for the year.
The cause of last week's pain was a combination of inflation fears and disappointing corporate-earnings
reports. Following Friday's fat wholesale-price numbers, investors fear that inflation is worse than the
optimists thought, and that higher interest rates and sluggish financial markets are in store as the Federal
Reserve tries to stamp inflation out.
Those fixated on historical coincidences note that in both 1929 and 1987, stocks crashed 55 days after their
peak. Tomorrow will be 55 calendar days after the industrials peaked Aug. 25.
But most investors say that what worries them is less exotic. It is the idea that stocks now are going through
something a lot worse than a correction: a "stealth" bear market.
The most common definition of a bear market is a 20% decline from a high. The industrials would have to fall
another 958 points to hit that level. But unlike the indexes, the average stock is more than 20% off its high
and has been for weeks. What keeps the indexes up is a handful of huge glamour stocks such as Microsoft,
General Electric, Cisco Systems and International Business Machines, which weigh heavily in the indexes.
IBM, for example, actually finished Friday up.
"The inner workings of the market don't seem right. It is very unsettling," says Michael Weiner, portfolio
manager at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
"The concern I am hearing isn't Dow 10000 per se. What I am hearing is the thought that what we are seeing
in the indexes isn't indicative of the broader market. It's hard to know how to make your next investment. If a
client gives you money, you have to decide what to do with it, and it isn't easy."
Mr. Hayes of Ned Davis Research has been skeptical of stock gains for some time, and he thinks the market
declines now are confirming his views. He recently sent a commentary to clients suggesting that by various
market measures, notably one that measures the performance of the broad market rather than the indexes,
we already are in a bear market. That, he says, will become official when the indexes join the majority of
stocks by falling the requisite 20%.
More-bullish stock strategists, such as Mr. Kerschner of PaineWebber and Abby Joseph Cohen at Goldman
Sachs, say that stocks will have trouble matching past gains of 20% a year and more. But given the low level
of inflation, the economy's strength and the continuing gains in corporate earnings, they say, stocks also
aren't likely to fall very heavily.
Mr. Hayes is more pessimistic. The Dow industrials have tripled since early 1993 and have multiplied in value
more than tenfold since they began their prolonged bull run in 1982. At some point, he thinks, they will have
to digest these gains. The last time they paused for serious digestion, after the stock boom of the 1950s, the
picture wasn't too pretty. From the early 1960s until 1982, stocks essentially went nowhere -- for about 20
years.
More perplexing, all of this happened around the time the industrials were hitting 1000 for the first time. They
first touched 1000 during a trading day in 1966, but didn't actually finish the day above that level until 1972.
Then they bounced up and down for a decade and didn't move lastingly above 1000 until 1982.
When the industrials first moved above 10000, this year, some stock watchers worried that they could get
stuck at that level, as they did at the 1000 level. They noted that the industrials also had some trouble getting
past the 8000 and 9000 levels. The bulls shrug this off, noting that inflation still isn't the worry that it was in
the 1970s, that the government isn't running up a budget deficit as it was then, and that the U.S. isn't involved
in anything approaching the Vietnam War, as it was then.
True, says Mr. Hayes: "Every period is different. But I was out seeing clients, and that question kept coming
up."
There are, he says, troubling parallels. Oil prices are rising again, as they were then, as are gold and other
commodities. Market gains are focused on a handful of market darlings, as they were then. The bond yield
started below 6% and then moved higher then, as it did this year. History won't necessarily repeat itself, Mr.
Hayes says, but "actually, there are quite a few similarities."

Friday's Market Activity
Market averages skidded sharply lower as Alan Greenspan stunned investors with some harsh commentary
in a late Thursday speech and inflation worries delivered a crippling follow-up Friday.
Chase Manhattan fell 4 7/16 to 66 1/2, Providian Financial dropped 4 15/16 to 80 3/4, and American Express
retreated 7 to 135. The losses came after a surprising piece of economic data, a report of
stronger-than-expected gains in producer prices in September, exacerbated worries that rates would head
higher again this year.
General Motors finished down 2 7/8 to 62 1/8, Maytag fell 1 3/8 to 35 1/2, and Kmart eased 1/2 to 10.
International Paper fell 2 3/4 to 47 3/8, Bethlehem Steel eased 7/16 to 6 5/16, reaching a 52-week low, and
Dow Chemical dropped 7 15/16 to 105 1/8.
Most, although not all, technology stocks fell. America Online dropped 6 to 109. RealNetworks (Nasdaq)
retreated 6 to 92 15/16. Phone.Com (Nasdaq) slid 12 3/4 to 199 3/4. Motorola fell 4 3/4 to 88.
Caterpillar gained 7/16 to 56 1/16. The Peoria, Ill., construction- and farm-equipment maker reported
third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's forecasts.
Dover rose 1 13/16 to 39 15/16. The New York manufacturer of elevators and other industrial products posted
stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit.
Archer-Daniels-Midland fell 1 to 11 11/16. The Decatur, Ill., maker of food additives and ingredients missed
Wall Street's profit targets.
Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) moved ahead 3 5/32 to 92 9/16. The Palo Alto, Calif., computer maker reported
fiscal first-quarter results that beat what Wall Street anticipated.
A number of other technology names, benefiting from encouraging profit performances, defied the broad
market's selloff. Shares of Microchip Technology (Nasdaq) gained 6 9/16 to 57 3/4. The Chandler, Ariz.,
memory-products maker reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings Thursday. On
Friday, Credit Suisse First Boston raised its earnings estimates and price target on the stock.
Veritas Software (Nasdaq) climbed 9 5/8 to 91 3/32, reaching a 52-week high. The Mountain View, Calif.,
developer of storage-management software posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results. CS First
Boston raised its estimates on the stock, and reiterated its strong buy rating.
Powerwave Technology added 5 3/16 to 60 1/2, establishing its 52-week high. The Irvine, Calif., maker of
wireless-communications network products turned in thirdquarter numbers that beat analysts' forecasts.
Warburg Dillon Read increased its earnings estimates on the stock, and raised its price target.
The losses in the session came on a combination of disturbing developments. First, Alan Greenspan, in an
address to an audience of bank regulators, issued what were interpreted as more broadsides aimed at the
value of the stock market. Though the central bank chairman's cautionary comments may not have been as
pointed as some of his previous edicts on the market, the address drew some comparisons to his famous
"irrational exuberance" speech of December 1996.
Wobbled, then, ahead of the session, U.S. equities absorbed another damaging blow after the September
producer-prices data showed more robust economic expansion than investors were anticipating.
The data sparked concerns that the Federal Reserve may not have been as vigilant as it needed to be in
raising interest rates this year. Though analysts, such as John Manley, market strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney, insisted that "I don't think the Fed is behind the curve" in fighting inflation, such worries are going to
persist until more data come in showing that the U.S. economy has begun to slow.
At the very least, the data Friday signaled "the Fed is going to have to raise rates again," said Peter Canelo,
market strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. When that happens -- at the next Federal Open Market
Committee meeting on Nov. 16, or perhaps even outside the parameters of that policy meeting -- "is a detail,"
Mr. Canelo said.
That kind of reaction not only walloped the financial stocks, which entered a market correction as far back as
April, it also finally snared the technology stocks, a group that has, by and large, ignored the setback in the
broad list.

"The big catalyst is the Nasdaq composite," Peter Green, technical analyst at Gruntal, said Friday. "That's
been the market leader, and so it's going to have to go down further."
On Friday, the Nasdaq composite closed the session with a loss of 75.01, down 2.7%, to end at 2731.83.
The declines drew comparisons to previous October Fridays, especially inasmuch as dismal autumn Fridays,
through history, have preceded historic Monday losses.
In fact, some market strategists acknowledged the comparisons to October market setbacks in 1997, and,
before that, in 1987. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum, said in a report late Friday
that, based on technical performance in Friday's trading, he expected "a likely exhuastive selling climax either
Monday or Tuesday."

The first word that came to mind when I heard that Robert A. Mundell had just won the Nobel Prize in
economics was vindication. Back in the 1960s Mr. Mundell, who then taught at the University of Chicago, was
considered beyond the fringes of mainstream economics. He was the leader of a small group of economists --
most of the time I thought it was just the two of us -- who advocated fixed exchange rates, warned of
impending inflation if the U.S. went off gold and called for tax cuts to spur economic growth. Many in the
profession called him a kook. Today they call him a Nobel laureate.
More important than this personal recognition, Mr. Mundell has reshaped the world in the image of his vibrant
new paradigm, which journalist Jude Wanniski called "The Way the World Works." Mr. Mundell has been as
influential as John Maynard Keynes, the difference being that Mr. Mundell got it right.
I remember my first encounter with him, at a University of Chicago workshop. It was winter 1967 in the Windy
City, and I was visiting from sunny California. To me, the university workshop looked like a set from "The
Addams Family" -- a stark, dimly lit room, sparsely furnished with a dusty oak table and chairs, soot-covered
windows and a clanging steam radiator. In walked a sallow, tousle-headed, pipe-smoking figure wearing a
faded trenchcoat belted with a clothesline cord. Bob Mundell's odd appearance was exacerbated by his
painfully slurred speech. After the workshop we went to the Quad Club for martinis, whereupon his speech
went from bad to worse. But however slurred the delivery, his economics had never been sharper or more
lucid. Bob quickly made a convert of me -- and, before long, of a few others, including the editor of this
editorial page.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal was downright old-fashioned.
It was the bastion of monetarism, partial-equilibrium price theory, budget-balancing drum-thumpers,
worshippers at the altar of trade surpluses, and holier-than-thou finger-waggers. Mr. Mundell's profound logic
would have had little impact had it not been for a grand alliance with this editorial page.
Robert Bartley was advanced beyond his years when, at 34, he was named editor of the Journal's editorial
page in 1972. He was a young man with an awesome mission of searching for a radically new paradigm. The
resultant explosive combination of the two Bobs -- Mundell and Bartley -- has changed the face of the earth.
Much of the history of these early years is chronicled in detail in Mr. Bartley's 1992 book, "The Seven Fat
Years."
Mr. Mundell's classic dichotomy between the appropriate use of monetary and fiscal policies lies at the crux of
his new paradigm. Living in a world that was being brought to its knees by hyperinflation, hyperunemployment
and hyperactive do-gooders, Mr. Mundell provided the cure: tight money and tax-rate cuts. As simple as this
policy mix is to all of us today, it sure wasn't obvious back then.
Mr. Mundell and his closest compatriot at the University of Chicago suffered at the hands of their academic
colleagues. The press and the political establishment of that time and place were anything but open-minded
about tight money reining in inflation and the incentive effects of tax-rate cuts spurring economic growth and
employment. Economists back then actually had the chutzpah to say that inflation was caused by low
unemployment, and high unemployment in turn was caused by tight money and insufficient government
spending.
While other scholars have long recognized the importance of the global economy, it is Bob Mundell who put
the individual economy into proper perspective in the world economy. Goods, labor, money, technology and
bonds flow almost as freely across national boundaries as they do within an economy, Mr. Mundell explains.
The porous nature of national boundaries throws into question the preponderance of macroeconomic models
that postulate independent national monetary policies, fiscal policies or national policies of any other sort. To
Mr. Mundell, the only closed economy is the world itself. The only meaningful monetary policy is global
monetarism. National economics can be understood only in the context of the world economy. No longer was

international economics an embarrassing adjunct to domestic macroeconomics. International economics was
the core discipline of macroeconomics.
His 1973 article "Uncommon Arguments for Common Currencies," along with his keen sense of cultural
diversity and politics, formed the basis of what now is known as the euro. Bob took the academic community
head-on both by showing the fatal flaws in the logic of floating exchange rates and by elucidating the
impeccable logic of the gains from trading money across national boundaries.
I have always been especially enamored of Bob's idea of "menu costs." In the context of inflation, menu
costs derive from the need of a restaurant to change menus as prices rise. The higher the inflation, the
greater the menu costs. If the menu example doesn't strike your fancy, try regrinding parking meters, or
training businesspeople in the use of log tables. Inflation confers very real costs on doing business.
Menu costs are not only a problem in a world of changing prices over time; they are just as real when there
are two or more moneys in different locations at any one moment. Who hasn't felt the bite of these menu
costs when traveling through Europe with their pesetas, guilders, francs, marks, pounds, kroner, shillings, lire,
drachmas, etc.? Floating exchange rates in such a world are patently absurd. Mr. Mundell's euro is the
obvious solution. His cross to bear, however, is the vast cadre of incompetent bureaucrats scurrying back and
forth in the porticos of Europe's capitals whose job is to implement his vision. Talk about casting pearls before
swine.
Bob Mundell's impact on the practical world of real politics can be seen in Reagan's America, in Thatcher's
Britain, in the renaissance of Chile and Argentina, and in Jakob Frankel's monetary policy in Israel. The
most recent testament to the success of Mr. Mundell's version of economics has taken place in Keizo
Obuchi's Japan. Mr. Mundell has transformed every aspect of the political economy.
Receiving the Nobel Prize in economics is a great honor. But Mr. Mundell deserves an even higher honor --
to be recognized as the best economist of the century.

Mundell Wins Nobel Prize in Economics --- Columbia University Figure Is a Father of the Euro And

Robert A. Mundell, one of the intellectual fathers of both the new European common currency and
Reagan-era supplyside economics, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science.
Mr. Mundell conducted innovative research into common currencies when the idea of the euro, Europe's new
currency, was still a fantasy. The 66-year-old Columbia University professor, a native of Canada, also
examined the implications of cross-border capital flows and flexible foreign-exchange rates when capital flows
were still restricted and currencies still fixed to each other.
"Mundell chose his problems with uncommon -- almost prophetic -- accuracy in terms of predicting the future
development of international monetary arrangements and capital markets," the selection committee said in
announcing the prize.
An eccentric, white-haired figure who once bought an abandoned Italian castle as a hedge against inflation,
Mr. Mundell later became a hero of the economic Right with his dogged defense of the gold standard and
early advocacy of the controversial tax-cutting, supply-side economics that became the hallmark of the
Reagan administration.
While the Nobel committee sidestepped his political impact in awarding Mr. Mundell the $975,000 prize for his
work in the 1960s, his conservative fans celebrated the award as an endorsement of supply-side thinking.
"I know it will take a little longer, but history eventually will note that it was Mundell who made it possible for
Ronald Reagan to be elected president," by providing the intellectual backing for the Reagan tax cuts, wrote
conservative economist Jude Wanniski on his Web site.
Mr. Mundell's advocacy of supply-side economics sprang from his work in the 1960s examining what fiscal
and monetary policies are appropriate if exchange rates are either fixed -- as they were prior to the collapse
of the gold-based Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s -- or floating, as they are in the U.S. and many
other countries today.
One major finding has since become conventional wisdom: When money can move freely across borders,
policy makers must choose between exchange-rate stability and an independent monetary policy. They
can't have both.
Mr. Mundell's work has long had an impact on policy makers. In 1962, he wrote a paper addressing the
Kennedy administration's predicament of how to spur the economy while facing a balance-of-payments
deficit. "The only correct way to do it was to have a tax cut and then protect the balance of payments by tight
money," he recalled in a 1996 interview. The Kennedy administration eventually came around to the same
way of thinking.
Mr. Mundell traces the supply-side movement to a 1971 meeting of distinguished economists, including Paul
Volcker and Paul Samuelson, at the Treasury Department. At the time, most economists were stumped by
the onset of stagflation -- a combination of inflationary pressures, a troubled dollar, a worsening balance of
payments and persistent unemployment. They thought any tightening of monetary or fiscal policy would
bolster the dollar and improve the balance of payments, but worsen unemployment. An easing of monetary or
fiscal policy might generate jobs, but weaken the dollar, lift prices and expand the balance-of-payments
deficit.
Mr. Mundell suggested a heretical solution: Raise interest rates to protect the dollar, but cut taxes to spur the
economy. Most others in the room were aghast at the idea, fearing tax cuts would lead to a swelling budget
deficit -- something many nonsupply-siders believe was exactly what happened during the Reagan years.

"I knew I was in the minority," he said in an 1988 interview. "But I thought my vote should count much more
than the others because I understood the subject."
At the University of Chicago early in his career, Mr. Mundell befriended a student named Arthur Laffer, and
together they were at the core of the supply-side movement. Even today, Mr. Mundell predicts similar policies
will be necessary to keep the U.S. economic expansion going. "Monetary policy isn't going to be enough to
stay up there and avoid a recession," he said in an interview yesterday. "We'll have to have tax reduction,
too."
While in Chicago, he found himself constantly at odds with Milton Friedman, who advocated monetary rules
and floating exchange rates. Mr. Mundell joined Columbia in 1974, two years before Mr. Friedman won the
economics Nobel.
Ever the maverick, Mr. Mundell remains a fan of the gold standard and fixed exchange rates at a time when
they're out of favor with most other economists. "You have fixed rates between New York and California, and
it works perfectly," he said.
The Nobel committee also praised Mr. Mundell's research into common currency zones, which laid the
intellectual foundation for the 11-country euro. In 1961, when European countries still clung to their national
currencies, he described the circumstances in which nations could share a common currency.
"At the time, it just seemed like such a wacko thing to work on, and that's why it's so visionary," said Kenneth
Rogoff, a Harvard economist.
In particular, Mr. Mundell argued that in any successful currency zone, workers must be able to move freely
from areas that are slowing to areas that are booming. Some critics suggest the euro nations don't fit his
description.
But Mr. Mundell believes the new currency will eventually challenge the dollar for global dominance. "The
benefits will derive from transparency of pricing, stability of expectations and lower transactions costs, as well
as a common monetary policy run by the best minds that Europe can muster," Mr. Mundell wrote last year.
He began working on the euro project as a consultant to European monetary authorities in 1969.
Outside academia, Mr. Mundell has led a colorful life. Worried about the onset of inflation in the late 1960s,
he bought and renovated a 16th century Italian castle originally built for Pandolfo Petrucci, the "Strong Man of
Siena." Mr. Mundell has four children, who range in age from one to 40.

Future generations no doubt will look back on the 1990s as a golden age of prosperity in the U.S. -- and
probably also as a golden age of financial fraud.
It was in this decade that a Canadian gold-mining company called Bre-X Minerals Ltd. saw its stock value
soar to $4.5 billion, until its miracle Indonesian mine was exposed as a hoax. Fraudulent trading brought
down two eminent investment banks in succession, Kidder, Peabody & Co. and Baring Bros.
Just this fall, reclusive, would-be insurance mogul Martin Frankel and garrulous market guru Martin
Armstrong were arrested within days of each other, each charged by federal prosecutors with swindling
investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. A San Antonio group called InverWorld Inc. in August was
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil lawsuit of defrauding Mexican clients of the
bulk of their $475 million in investments.
And while these scandals have gotten the big headlines, regulators say the most devastating fraud for
ordinary people has been the long-running epidemic of small-stock scams. Mushrooming faster than
prosecutors can shut them down, they feature pushy telephone and Internet salesmen stealing billions from
gullible investors each year.
The amounts at stake today certainly dwarf past swindles, both because of inflation and because technology
helps money flow at a rate never seen before. But some of the characters at the center of allegations today
bring to mind characters of the past. Mr. Armstrong, for example, is accused of using a method popularized
by Charles Ponzi, whose pyramid scheme based in Boston took in $15 million in 1920, equivalent to about
$125 million today. When the fugitive Mr. Frankel was found this summer hiding in a Hamburg, Germany,
luxury hotel with a cache of diamonds and cash, he looked like a character in a novel by Agatha Christie or
Dashiell Hammett. (Mr. Armstrong denies any wrongdoing, and Mr. Frankel's lawyer says his client is
contesting the extradition charges against him.)
Financial historians don't find it surprising that so many swindles and alleged swindles are blossoming now.
Periods of affluence, they say, are precisely when ordinary people and sophisticated investors alike, seeing
friends and relatives striking it rich, put aside their good sense and fall victim to greed or envy. But the
historians are intrigued by the parallels they see between this era's frauds and those from past periods of
financial frenzy.
"It happens year after year after year after year; it never changes," says Samuel Hayes, professor emeritus of
finance at the Harvard Business School. "Often the victims are people who are supposed to be very
sophisticated investors who shouldn't get caught like that. But they do."
Consider Sir Isaac Newton, one of history's most brilliant thinkers. He lost the equivalent of a modern-day $1
million in an 18th-century scam called the South Sea Bubble. Mark Twain, that great 19th-century skeptic,
repeatedly squandered his writing income on questionable investments, including a turn-of-the-century
version of biotechnology.
Or consider the unusual case of William Simon, the former Treasury secretary and Wall Street power broker,
who says he lost $1 million in a charity fraud involving something called the Foundation for New Era
Philanthropy. New Era promised to line up anonymous donors to match people's multimillion-dollar donations
to charity if they would just funnel the money through New Era.
Mr. Simon, Laurance Rockefeller, hedge-fund manager Julian Robertson and John Whitehead, former
Goldman, Sachs & Co. co-chairman, all fell for it.

--- Page 112 ---
Page 112 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But Mr. Simon insists he wasn't really the victim of a scam. He has visited New Era founder John Bennett in
jail and has offered him a job if he is paroled. Mr. Simon says that, while Mr. Bennett committed a fraud by
failing to match the money, he simply got in over his head and couldn't meet commitments. "People have said
to me, 'Well you were fooled,' and I suppose it is true that I was fooled because I don't believe he did anything
to defraud me," says Mr. Simon, who today devotes most of his time to philanthropy. "To this day I believe his
intentions were correct."
Mr. Simon's willingness to forgive a million-dollar loss may touch on something else about financial frauds:
They burgeon at times of great prosperity, when normal skepticism is overcome by the sight of enormous
wealth.
"The bull market creates conditions that are favorable to pulling off a fraud," says Richard Sylla, professor of
financial history at New York University's Stern School of Business. "Ten years ago people weren't interested
in jumping into the market," he continues, but "it begins to burn you when you know some people who are
getting rich. You say, 'There is nothing special about them, I know them, they were C students and I was a B+
student, so I'd better get in.'"
The Netherlands was rising to the height of its mercantile power when tulipmania struck in the 17th century.
Investors briefly paid more for a tulip bulb than for a house. Stocks were booming and empire was building in
early 18th-century Britain, when smooth operators, relying at times on commentaries written by such
renowned authors as Jonathan Swift and Daniel Defoe, pumped up the shares of a trading group called the
South Sea Company. And it was at the start of the Roaring '20s, with the U.S. entering a period of
unprecedented prosperity, that Charles Ponzi ran his fraud.
Does that suggest that today's golden age for fraud may herald an end to the bull market? NYU's Prof. Sylla
says he has a "feeling in my bones that something bad could happen."
But past experience is mixed. The popping of Britain's South Sea Bubble did lead to a period of economic
decline. The speculative excess of the 1980s culminated in the '87 crash, but stocks bounced back with
amazing speed. Dutch tulip-mania, although it destroyed some fortunes, didn't much affect the broader
economy. And while the Roaring '20s certainly ended badly, it wasn't Charles Ponzi's fault; he went to jail
nine years before the crash.
Either way, the bull-market mentality seems to foster fraudulent schemes. It may have driven Japanese
financial institutions to seek big commodity and currency gains through Mr. Armstrong's Princeton Economics
International, which according to court documents filed in federal court in New York may have lost a big part
of the institutions' several hundred million dollars in investments. Mr. Armstrong strenuously denies stealing
any money and says he will be vindicated. "This case is far more complicated than anyone expects," he said
outside a courtroom this month after pleading innocent.
The sky's-the-limit mentality also may have helped spur the New Era charity scheme, as wealthy donors saw
their donations doubled. It certainly fanned the fires of the Bre-X gold mania, and put pressure on traders at
Baring and Kidder to falsify accounts.
That kind of euphoria also appears to have clouded the vision of Sir Isaac Newton, a pioneer in explaining the
laws of gravity who apparently forgot that they also can apply to the stock market. Newton was a savvy public
figure, active in university life and at one point a member of Parliament. When 18th-century promoters
developed a complicated scheme to help pay off the national debt through the South Sea Company, Newton
acquired some shares.
As talk spread in London that the company was a huge bubble, manipulated by the promoters, the share
price leveled off. Newton then apparently sold out at a big profit, the present-day equivalent of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
But the great man's skepticism was clouded by the sight of the stock continuing to soar. Although he is said to
have considered the whole thing a bubble, Newton apparently found it too tantalizing to avoid. Economists
call this the "bigger fool" theory of investing. An investor buys a stock -- maybe nowadays an Internet issue
with no profits but a skyrocketing market value -- knowing it is of dubious value but confident of selling it to
someone even more foolish before it falls. "They call it momentum investing now," Prof. Sylla says.
In a 1990 anthology called "Crashes and Panics," Larry Neal, professor of economics at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, estimates that South Sea stock rose more than 640% in the space of six
months at the start of 1720. Some of today's fraudulent boiler-room stocks, and some Internet-related stocks
as well, have risen faster.
In any case, Newton bought back in and the South Sea stock collapsed. His losses totaled 20,000, which
economist John Kenneth Galbraith has calculated as the current equivalent of more than $1 million, wiping
out the earlier gains and much more.

What makes many of these swindles work devilishly well is that they often begin, or appear to begin, as
legitimate investment projects, turning into frauds only after the initial plan goes bad.
Some victims of the New Era scheme, for example, point out that anonymous donors, matching gifts and
relationships of trust are common in the charity world. Even Ponzi's scheme appeared to be based on a
perfectly legitimate plan to benefit from exchange-rate differences.
Ponzi found that he could buy a postal-reply coupon in Spain for a penny and redeem it, in the U.S., for a
dime. Trouble was, there never were enough such coupons to cover the millions of dollars he got from
investors who formed lines outside his office. He simply paid big profits to old investors with money flooding in
from new ones. That pyramid system already had been used many times before, notably by a
turn-of-the-century hustler nicknamed "520% Miller," who promised his dupes 10% profit a week for 52
weeks. But Ponzi's investors were so faithful that, even after press exposes were published, people continued
putting in money until he was arrested and jailed.
Famous names also can lull investors into a false sense of security. "There will always be this piling on and
piggybacking on respectable names who you assume have done the homework, and who haven't," says
Harvard's Prof. Hayes. He speculates that the famous-name factor played a role in Japanese investments
with Mr. Armstrong. "The Japanese investors were substantial firms with good connections and plenty of
opportunity to do their due diligence, and apparently they didn't," Prof. Hayes says. "Someone gave them
assurance that there was imprimatur and they just got in."
Mr. Bennett, New Era's founder, played up an association with mutual-fund legend John Templeton, himself a
philanthropist, who invited Mr. Bennett to serve on the boards of some of his funds. Mr. Templeton stresses
that he never put any money into New Era.
"We believed in him," former Treasury Secretary Simon says, referring to Mr. Bennett. "When you get people
like John Templeton, Ray Chambers, the Rockefellers, who are all people who are involved in the world of
charity, it looks like this is real."
Mark Twain appears to have been swayed by investments linked to well-known businessmen or politicians.
His losing bets ranged from a health-food company to a new printing process and an Austrian carpet-weaving
machine. At least he was able to make fun of himself, and his experiences spawned some classic Twain
one-liners.
"There are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: when he can't afford it, and when he can,"
he grumbled in "Following the Equator," an 1897 travel book. At around the same time, in "Pudd'nhead
Wilson," he issued this still-topical lament: "October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to
speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June,
December, August and February."

Mundell on Supply-Side Economics
Mundell on Supply-Side Economics

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Robert A. Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following
are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica,
an Italian economics journal. (Reprinted with permission.)
Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of
personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary
system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring
a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on
stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset.
The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only
gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25% under {Treasury} Secretary {Andrew} Mellon. But in June 1932,
during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a
maximum level of 60%. They remained at or (frequently) considerably above this level for half a century. The
grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange
of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to
placate the political right.
The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and
increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the
same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate
fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The
exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the
requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second
pillar in the platform of supply-side economics.
Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It
would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older
demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic
credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented
models of global monetarism and macroeconomics.
Supply-side economics shares much in common with each of the three schools but nevertheless rejects
certain features of each and adds elements of its own. With Friedmanism, it accepts the importance of the
quantity theory of money but rejects the policy program of fixed growth and flexible exchange rates so dear to
the hearts of monetarists. With Keynesianism it accepts the multiplier and the possibility of using tax cuts to
spur growth in the midst of a recession; but it takes account of reverse multiplier effects associated with
bond-financing of budget deficits and it rejects inflation as counterproductive. With neo-Ricardianism it
accepts the importance of expectations and time-consistency, but rejects the extreme super rationality and
altruistic form of the equivalence proposition.
Supply-side economics achieved major victories in monetary and tax policy in an amazingly short period of
time. From its beginnings in 1971 through its first success in indexing tax brackets in Canada in 1973, to the
first credited implementation in the United States in 1981, considerable success was achieved in less that a
decade. The Economy Recovery Act in 1981, based on the Kemp-Roth bill, cut income taxes by about 25%,
and its sequel, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, made sweeping changes in the tax code that included an
elimination of many loopholes and a slashing of tax rates in the highest income brackets to 28%.
One of the important tools of analysis, and a strong selling point of supply-side analysis was the Laffer curve,
relating tax rates and tax revenues. . . . The proposition that tax rates increase revenue up to a point of
maximum revenue after which they fall was by no means new. It must have been known to wise chancellors
of the ancient world devising tax systems. David Hume, referring to indirect taxation wrote that "a duty upon

--- Page 115 ---
Page 115 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
commodities checks itself; and a prince will soon find that an encrease of the impost is no encrease of his
revenue." ...
Nevertheless, if not new, it was certainly forgotten in the half century between 1932 and 1981 when marginal
tax rates were never less than 60% and hovered at times near 100%. . . .
The Carter administration had followed an easy money policy along the lines of the neo-classical synthesis. It
aggravated inflation and, because of the progressive income tax, tightened fiscal policy. The result was a
steep depreciation of the dollar.
The neo-classical synthesis proved to be an appropriate policy mix as it had been in the early years of the
Kennedy administration. The Reagan administration reversed the Carter policy mix in favor of the
Mundell-Fleming policy mix of tight money (to stop the inflation) and fiscal ease (supply-side tax cuts to spur
economic growth and increase defense spending).
Because the tight money was implemented before the tax cuts could take the effect, the economy moved into
a steep recession, reaching bottom in November 1982. From this point on, the economy moved into an
expansion that has continued into the Bush administration, the longest peacetime expansion on record.
In the first term of the Reagan-Bush administrations, the dollar appreciated strongly in the face of the
strengthening economy (after 1982), having the beneficial effect of slowing the inflation at the same time the
economy was accelerating. In 1984, however, growth in the economy slowed and the Federal Reserve
shifted to a more expansionary monetary policy. The dollar peaked in February 1985 at about DM 3.4 and
230 yen. It then began a descent that continued through the 1987 stock market crash. Nevertheless, in 1988
and 1989, with the economy still expanding, the dollar became strong again, recovering against the yen and
the European currencies, only to depreciate again in 1990.
Supply-siders had recommended a reform of the international monetary system and a movement to stable
exchange rates. This would have prevented the overshooting of the yen and mark in 1987. Only a limited
success of the supply-side program was achieved in the field of international monetary reform with the Plaza
and Louvre agreements to coordinate exchange rates. Missing from this arrangement was an anchor for the
major currencies (to prevent all countries from inflating together under fixed exchange rates). In lieu of an
anchor, the Group of Seven attempted to devise a criterion in the form of a price index to adjudicate whether
surplus countries should expand or deficit countries contract. Intensive discussions were held at the IMF
meeting in September 1987, but progress in this field got side-tracked after the 1987 stock market crash. . . .
I have already noted that supply-side economics stressed the usefulness of a fixed exchange rate system tied
to a stable monetary unit. In the early years of international relations, it was not possible to think in terms of a
world currency because there was no possibility of organizing one among nations who went to war against
each other. No international monetary system is warproof. In lieu of an international currency, trading nations
settled on one or more of the precious metals, and throughout the ages, the coins of a major economic power
became important units of account.
The gold standard represented such a system and the gold sovereign, the currency of the leading economic
power, became the most important unit of account. But the gold standard broke down in 1914, and despite
attempts to reconstruct it, conditions were never appropriate. The gold exchange standard established in the
1920s broke down because it was erected on too slender a gold base, a casualty of World War I inflation.
History repeated itself in the post-World War II period after inflation had again undervalued gold. This led to
a run on the gold stock of the United States, the only power with even a partially gold-convertible currency.
In the decade of the 1970s, the decision by IMF members to adopt a managed flexible exchange rate system
was accompanied by a commitment to emphasize the role of the SDR and to reduce and banalize the role of
gold. . . .
In the days of the Cold War, national security took priority over monetary systems. But in the post-Cold War
era there is likely to be both less opposition and more to gain from a stable international currency. The
emerging multi-polar world has in many respects more in common with the patterns of world power in the
heyday of the gold standard than with the recent bi-polar past. It presents a better opportunity to create a
world central bank with a stable international currency than at any previous time in history. There is no
reason why the gold stocks held by governments and central banks should not be utilized to create an
international money.
There are numerous options. A trillion-dollar central bank, producing its own currency, backed by gold and
foreign exchange reserves (and, if necessary, other convertible currencies) could be made the central
institution around which a stable international monetary system could be erected.

Dollar, After Surging Against the Yen, Finishes the Session Mixed in New York

NEW YORK -- Investors didn't take long to conclude that the elation following Japan's announcement to
boost liquidity was premature.
The dollar rallied a yen and a half Wednesday after the Bank of Japan announced it would expand its
money-market operations, but that optimism faded quickly. By the end of the U.S. trading session, the dollar
was being sold alongside U.S. stocks and bonds. It closed slightly higher against the yen but lower against
the euro.
After its Wednesday policy meeting the Bank of Japan said it would expand money-market operations.
Keeping short-term interest rates near zero, it announced it would start the outright purchase of short-term
government bonds in an effort to "assure further permeation of the effects of monetary easing."
T.J. Marta, currency analyst at Citibank in New York, said markets initially saw the Bank of Japan's move as
an offering of an "olive branch" to critics who had urged the central bank to loosen monetary policy and to
weaken the yen.
By day's end, traders were again turning their attention to interest-rate worries, concluding that little had really
changed in Japan's monetary policy.
Late Wednesday in New York, the dollar was trading at 106.54 yen, up from 106.21 yen late Tuesday. The
euro was buying $1.0811, its peak level since Aug. 5 and up from $1.0762 the day before.
It was almost a repeat of Tuesday's market action. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 184.90 points
yesterday after suffering a 231.12-point drop Tuesday. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond moved
briefly to its highest level of the year at 6.29%, but ended at 6.27%.
Markets have been falling all week as inflation worries mounted in the wake of last Friday's jobs data,
improving global growth prospects and rising commodities prices. And speculation is mounting that the
Federal Reserve will boost interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Nov. 16 meeting.
The concurrent tightening of monetary policy could have a neutralizing effect in currency markets, but most
likely will cause volatility with market players "hanging on the lips of policy markets," Mr. Marta said.
While the euro is supported by the specter of higher interest rates in the euro-zone, the dollar follows the
reaction of U.S. assets to interest-rate concerns.
Of late, stocks and bonds have both sold off on inflation fears, which for the U.S. signals an impending
slowdown. In Europe, higher rates are seen as a sign of recovery and one which will make eurozone
investment more attractive.
Elsewhere, the South African rand hit a four-week low against the dollar, damping positive sentiment toward
the currency which had traded at higher levels since gold began to rally three weeks ago.
A large order for dollars sparked a round of technical selling which drove the rand lower, traders said. Late
Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 6.1279 rand, up strongly from 6.0755 rand late Tuesday.
The Canadian dollar fell to five-week lows against the U.S. dollar, weighed down by the specter of higher U.S.
interest rates, which would make Canadian assets less attractive. Late Wednesday, the U.S. currency was
trading at 1.4821 Canadian dollars, compared with $1.4754 Canadian dollars late Tuesday.

NEW YORK -- Blue-chip issues reeled under another onslaught from rising interest rates, while earnings
disappointments sent technology issues skidding in a session of sharp, broad-based losses.
Shares of Citigroup fell 1 11/16 to 43 13/16, while Chase Manhattan lost 2 1/16 to 71 3/16, and J.P. Morgan
dropped 4 3/8 to 109 1/2. The losses in the group came as the steady rise in Treasury yields propelled the
bellwether long bond's yield past the 6 1/4 % threshold, a level where Treasury returns become more
competitive versus equity returns, which could persuade some investors to swap stock holdings for bonds.
At the very least, the signs abounded that investors raised lots of cash in the session. Blue-chip stocks of
every stripe turned lower. Consumer names, such as Procter & Gamble, off 2 1/16 to 95 1/8, and Campbell
Soup, down 1 7/16 to 39 7/8, suffered in the same measure as cyclical names, which saw AlliedSignal drop 2
1/16 to 58 5/16 and Deere fall 1 5/8 to 36 3/8.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, logging its second straight session of steep losses, tumbled 184.90, or
1.77%, to close at 10232.16. The decline brought its two-session total of losses to 416.02 points.
A few commodity plays finished higher, including Barrick Gold among precious metals, which increased 1
7/16 to 21 3/4, and Atlantic Richfield among oils, which gained 1 9/16 to 88 1/2.
This time there would be no sanctuary in the high-technology sector. Not after Intel disappointed Wall Street
with another underwhelming quarterly profit performance late Tuesday. Intel (Nasdaq) fell 4 9/16 to 72 1/8, as
the chip maker jarred confidence in the third-quarter earnings outlook, especially for high technology.
"We don't have any clarity on interest rates, and we're learning that earnings aren't going to be the catalyst
for this market after all," said Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason. "Where do you get the
conviction to be a buyer under those circumstances?"
The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index, which fell 27.49, or 2.09%, to 1285.55, ended the session 9.4%
below its closing high of the year. Analysts said that, if there are to be further losses, the technology sector is
going to suffer more than the broad market.
As investors lost some of their confidence in the superior earnings outlook for technology stocks, they started
to sell off their holdings in stocks scheduled to report third-quarter results this week.
Shares of Sandisk (Nasdaq) fell 8 to 46 1/4; after the close of the session, the Palo Alto, Calif., developer of
data-storage products reported its fiscal third-quarter results. Results matched Wall Street forecasts.
Apple Computer (Nasdaq), which also came out with stronger-than-expected numbers after the close of
trading, fell 3 21/32 to 64 1/32. Earthlink Networks (Nasdaq), also on the schedule to report yesterday,
declined 3 to 41 15/16.
Meanwhile, other chip names fell in sympathy with the selloff in Intel. Linear Technology (Nasdaq) lost 2
23/32 to 55 25/32, despite posting stronger-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results ahead of the trading
session.
Motorola fell 4 9/16 to 90 3/8; the maker of communications electronics posted results in line with estimates
late Tuesday.
By the close of trading, the broader technology and telecommunications sector turned lower. Nextel
Communications (Nasdaq) fell 6 to 71, Qualcomm (Nasdaq) declined 7 23/32 to 204 11/32 and Qwest

Communications International (Nasdaq) gave up 2 13/16 to 33 7/16, as some of the market's most stalwart
names of the past few weeks started to show weakness.
Some stocks did manage to make some progress on their earnings performance.
BestFoods increased 7/8 to 49 7/8. The Englewood Cliffs, N.J., food maker reported third-quarter earnings
that topped what analysts had anticipated. Prudential Securities, in the wake of the profit statement, raised its
rating on the stock.
International Paper gained 11/16 to 49 3/8. Warburg Dillon Read boosted its earnings estimates on the stock
of the paper maker, following the company's report of stronger-than-expected profit.
But, more typically, investors sold off even in the face of what seemed like good news. Whirlpool fell 1 3/16 to
62 1/8, after the consumer-appliance maker late Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected results, and
enjoyed some encouraging comments from Lehman Brothers.
Tricon Global Restaurants finished 2 7/8 lower at 38 15/16, even though Lehman Brothers issued optimistic
comments about the restaurant chain's third-quarter profit performance. Released after the closing bell
Tuesday, the numbers showed the company beat analysts' forecasts.
Investors had no stomach for earnings disappointments. Bear Stearns fell 3 1/2 to 36 3/4, and sparked a
sell-off in the brokerage sector, after the Wall Street company came up short of earnings forecasts with its
fiscal first-quarter results.
Storage Technology lost 4 11/16 to 14 3/4. The Louisville, Colo., maker of data-storage systems warned its
third-quarter revenue and earnings are expected to come in significantly below forecasts.
Seagate Technology, another storage-products maker, fell 1 7/8 to 29 1/2, even though the Scotts Valley,
Calif., company surprised Wall Street by reporting a profit in its fiscal third quarter, instead of the loss Wall
Street was expecting.
SAP's American depositary shares fell 3 15/16 to 35. The German enterprise-software developer lowered its
1999 sales forecast to a range of 15% to 20% growth from 20% to 25%. Credit Suisse First Boston spoke
skeptically of the stock, saying that, at its current price, the risks outweighed the potential rewards of an
investment.
Aerospace and defense stocks continued to weaken. Class B shares of Raytheon fell 1 5/8 to 22 5/8, after
dropping 44% Tuesday after the company painted a discouraging portrait of its financial problems. More
analysts lowered their outlook for the company yesterday.
Meanwhile, General Dynamics shed 5 3/8 to 52 5/16 after SG Cowen lowered its rating on the stock, while
Lockheed Martin declined 1 1/16 to 27 5/8.
Chris-Craft Industries moved up 7 1/2 to 66, establishing a 52-week high. The New York television-station
owner is exploring a sale of all or part of its properties. CBS, which fell 1 1/16 to 45 3/8, News Corp., which
declined 5/8 to 27 7/8, and Tribune, which slipped 7/16 to 50 15/16, could be among the potential bidders,
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday.
Tyco dropped 6 3/8 to 97 before trading was halted on the NYSE. The stock fell as rumors circulated that the
company has suffered from accounting irregularities, but the company denied to an analyst at Goldman
Sachs that those reports were true, the analyst said.
Ziff-Davis-ZDNet rose 2 1/2 to 22 1/2. Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the stock of the New York Internet
site operator.
Occidental Petroleum gained 9/16 to 22 15/16. Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the Los Angeles oil and
gas concern.
E-Tek Dynamics (Nasdaq) lost 4 1/4 to 63. Underwriters of the San Jose, Calif., developer of
fiber-optic-network components' secondary offering agreed to release 50% of the 41.6 million shares subject
to a lock-up agreement that expires Nov. 10.
Whittman-Hart (Nasdaq) gained 1 1/8 to 38 13/16, reaching a 52-week high intraday. Warburg Dillon Read
started coverage of the Chicago electronic-commerce consulting concern with a "buy" rating.
Edison International gained 1 1/8 to 25 13/16. The Rosmead, Calif., power utility posted
stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit.

Wachovia declined 1 5/16 to 79 7/8. The Winston Salem, N.C., banking concern lost ground even though its
third-quarter profit proved stronger than expected.

Investors Sell Off Bonds Again in Weak Market,Propelling Interest Rates to Near Peak for Year

Investors Sell Off Bonds Again in Weak Market, Propelling Interest Rates to Near Peak for Year

NEW YORK -- Bonds continued their painful sell-off, sending interest rates near their highest level of the
year.
This weakness in the bond market that has continued apace in recent weeks has put upward pressure on
various other interest rates such as credit cards and mortgages, pinching consumers in the pocketbook.
The bond-price declines come amid worries about rising inflation and the strength of the global economy,
and a growing view among traders the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates in the months ahead.
Even marked weakness in the stock market did little to add luster to Treasury bonds, as investors willing to
buy fixed-income securities focused instead on more than $8 billion in agency and corporate debt hitting the
market, ignoring the Treasury market in the process.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 20/32, or $6.25 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to
97 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, climbed to 6.271%. The rout
was worse early in the day, but prices came back somewhat near day's end. The yield challenged the high for
the year, set in August, of 6.28%.
Medium-term bonds also dropped sharply. Ten-year Treasurys fell 12/32 to yield 6.097%.
"We went through [price] levels we all thought would bring in buyers, like 6.25% on the bond, but nothing
happened," said Mike Clorherty, market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
Instead, selling picked up in afternoon trading, as gold, oil and other commodities moved higher, sparking
fear the Federal Reserve will have to boost rates soon to stem inflation. Weakness in the Canadian bond
market also spilled over south of the border, while some investors took another look at Friday's employment
figures and didn't like what they saw.
"People are much more concerned about inflation and about [Fed Chairman] Alan Greenspan being behind
the curve," said William Lloyd, head of market strategy at Barclays Capital in New York.
Traders are focusing on producer-price and consumer-price data, to be released tomorrow and Tuesday,
respectively.
"If the [inflation] figures are as high as people expect they will be, thoughts of inflation being a problem will
return, even if it's not here right now, and the market will have to price in one more Fed move and the
possibility of another," said Jim Nealis, head Treasurys trader at PaineWebber.
Figures today on retail sales, and industrial production data tomorrow, also will be scrutinized by investors.
A move by the Bank of Japan to promote growth by purchasing short-term securities and to expand its
repurchaseagreement operations to inject liquidity in the market raised fears global growth will pick up,
putting pressure on rates around the world.
"The market looks oversold, but we're not buying" because in the longer term the "seeds have been sown for
higher inflation, due to higher commodity costs," says Jim Somers, a portfolio manager at Martindale Andres
& Co. in West Conshohocken, Pa.
Here are the details of yesterday's 52-week bill auction. All bids are awarded at a single price at the
market-clearing yield. Rates are determined by the difference between that price and face value.

Corporate Bonds
Despite longstanding fears the bond market would shut down in the fourth quarter ahead of 2000, investors
were clamoring for the $2 billion inaugural global bond issue from DuPont.
"To all those people who were worried about Y2K, this is another signal that the markets are not as illiquid as
people had predicted," said Mitchel Penn, portfolio manager at Legg Mason Capital Management in
Baltimore, who participated in the offering.
DuPont priced $1 billion of five-year securities and the same amount of 10-year securities via co-lead
managers and joint bookrunners Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
The five-year notes were priced at a yield margin of 0.83 percentage point over comparable U.S. Treasury
securities, while the 10-year notes priced at a yield margin of 0.98 percentage point over. The bonds later
firmed in secondary dealings.
Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to reduce short-term debt, according to DuPont's
treasurer, Susan Stalnecker.
Agency Issues
Freddie Mac tapped burgeoning demand for U.S. agency securities overseas, selling $5 billion of reference
notes with a yield of 0.525 percentage point over twoyear Treasurys.
Freddie Mac said more than half of the offering was sold overseas. Investors outside the U.S. tend to favor
shorter maturities because that minimizes currency and interest-rate risk while providing ample yield levels.
Many have been buying agency debt as an alternative to Treasurys. "A lot of accounts look to the
government agencies to provide liquid alternatives to Treasurys," said Drew Ertman, principal on the
syndicate desk at joint lead manager Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Although agencies don't have the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, they are congressionally
chartered entities and their debt enjoys top triple-A ratings.
ABN Amro Securities and Warburg Dillon Read also were joint lead managers of the offering.

NEW YORK -- Volatility climbed on the options market, as the stock market sold off.
Concerns about the direction of interest rates plagued the stock market, sending major market indexes
tumbling. In the options market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index gained 2.55 to
24.60. The VIX tracks certain Standard & Poor's 100 options prices to determine investor sentiment.
Gary Dear, managing member of Gotham Trading Group, a New York options-trading firm, said that the VIX
didn't hit dangerous levels. At least for now, it remains below 25, a level that options traders see as
significant. All things considered, Mr. Dear said, the amount of fear in the options market didn't seem out of
hand.
Scott Fullman, the options strategist at Swiss American Securities, also said that the VIX didn't register a
dramatic rise, but nonetheless he called yesterday's VIX action a "fairly decent move up."
Elsewhere in the options market:
Traders continued to focus on the gold sector. While Monday's session attracted options players to Barrick
Gold Corp., yesterday's favorite was Newmont Mining Corp. With the stock ending down 1 3/8 , or 5.1%, at
25 5/8 in New York Stock Exchange trading, the company's December 25 and December 30 calls traded
briskly.
At the CBOE, the December 25 call traded up 3/4 to 4 1/8 , while the December 30 call rose 3/4 to 1 7/8 .
With Friday's monthly expiration of options contracts just around the corner, the options market continued to
see traders rolling positions forward. According to an options trader, one options player did just that with a
5,000-contract position in the call options on Alaska Air Group Inc., moving from the October 35 calls into the
November 35s. Alaska Air's stock closed down 1 3/8 , or 3.3%, at 39 3/4 , also on the Big Board.

NEW YORK -- Traders ground it out, without guidance from the bond market.
In the absence of information on interest rates, a critical component of options and stock prices, most
traders concentrated on the mundane responsibilities of preparing their portfolios for Friday's expiration of
October options contracts.
The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, gained
0.86 to 22.06, keeping the barometer within its usual range of 17 to 25.
A lot of traders rolled October options contracts into November. Bold trades on the direction of stocks or the
stock market weren't apparent with the bond market closed for Columbus Day.
Traders who felt compelled to take positions used conservative approaches. In Barrick Gold Corp., a firm
sold 4,000 January 25 calls and bought 2,000 January 22 1/2 calls to create a ratio-bull spread that would
increase in value if the stock increases from its current 20 13/16.
Many traders used the lull to sell call options against stock in their portfolios.
Thousands of February 30 call options were sold on Harrah's Entertainment Inc. With the stock up 5/16 at 29
11/16, the February 30 calls fell 1/4 to 2 1/8 on volume of 3,003 contracts, compared with open interest of
1,214 contracts. The calls traded at 2 1/8 when the market was 2 1/8 to 2 3/8 and the stock was at 29 5/16.
A number of large call trades helped push the CBOE's equity put/call ratio to 0.67. The ratio is traditionally
interpreted as a contrarian sentiment indicator, which holds that if too many traders are bullish, the smart
approach is bearish. The index historically has been considered a bullish sentiment indicator at around 0.75
to 1; neutral from 0.40 to 0.75; bearish below 0.40. The CBOE's index put/call ratio was 1.70. The ratio is also
seen as a contrarian sentiment indicator. The index is considered bullish if the ratio is 1.5 or higher; neutral
from 0.75 to 1.5; bearish below 0.75.

Jakarta Discloses
Pertamina Losses
May Be $4 Billion
Indonesian state oil company Pertamina had losses of as much as $3.97 billion between April 1996 and
March 1998, and could lose an additional $721 million stemming from unfavorable contracts it entered during
the two years, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto said. Announcing the results of an audit of Pertamina
carried out by Pricewaterhouse-Coopers, Mr. Bambang said inefficiencies cost the company an estimated $2
billion; an additional $1.27 billion to $1.97 billion was lost as a result of what the report said were missed
opportunities. The government also announced the results of an audit of state commodity board Bulog by
accounting firm Arthur Andersen. That audit, covering five years ended in March 1998, found that the agency
incurred a loss of 6.7 trillion rupiah ($866 million) resulting from inefficiencies. "This was because of
unfavorable contract terms for Bulog, irregularities, incorrect practices and a weak supervision system," the
minister said. The government agreed to the audits of Pertamina and Bulog, as well as of electric utility
Perusahaan Listrik Negara, as part of the International Monetary Fund's rescue package for Indonesia.
Findings of the audit of PLN are expected this month.
The actual audits of Pertamina and Bulog weren't released, and government officials said they won't be made
public. Mr. Bambang said the auditing firms had used "sampling methods" that involved reviewing only some
of the companies' contracts. Because of this, he said, "the auditors are uncomfortable to make conclusions
about corruption."
Anglogold Bids for Australia's Acacia
South African gold-mining concern Anglogold launched a friendly bid valued at 832 million Australian dollars
($544.8 million) to acquire Australian gold miner Acacia Resources. The move by the world's largest
gold-mining company effectively trumps a hostile A$670 million bid for Acacia launched last month by
Australia's Delta Gold. Analysts said Anglogold's bid may herald a new round of takeovers in the sector as
acquirers move to beat rises in gold stocks triggered by soaring bullion prices. Anglogold is offering 3.5 of its
shares for every 100 Acacia shares, valuing Acacia shares at A$3.30 each, a 24% premium to Friday's
closing price of A$2.66. Acacia's board intends to recommend that shareholders accept Anglogold's offer, in
the absence of a higher bid, Acacia said. Anglogold shares are listed in Johannesburg, London, Brussels and
Paris, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange. Anglogold's formal offer is expected next month.
China's CNOOC to Launch Offering
Oil exploration group CNOOC, China's first major oil company to seek an overseas listing, said it plans to
offer two billion shares at 8.46 to 9.61 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.09 to US$1.24) a share in a dual listing in
Hong Kong and New York. The offer runs today through Friday; the price will be fixed on Oct. 20 in Hong
Kong. Trading in the shares there will begin Oct. 21 and is expected to begin in New York on Oct. 20.
Daewoo Foreign Creditors to Meet
Foreign creditors of South Korea's Daewoo Group are to meet Oct. 22 in Hong Kong, where they will either
accept or reject the ailing conglomerate's request for a freeze on an estimated $5 billion in foreign debt. A
person close to the negotiations said the foreign creditors' steering committee met with Daewoo and its
international advisers last week, spelling out the prerequisites that need to be included in any debt freeze and
workout plan. If the demands -- which include unwinding global transactions after a certain date and giving

--- Page 127 ---
Page 127 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
foreign creditors more say in a workout plan -- aren't met, the committee will disband and recommend that
Daewoo's 200-plus creditors pursue claims in international courts, he said. Separately, Daewoo Motor is in
talks with "two to three" European companies to sell its truck and bus manufacturing operations, a company
spokesman said. He declined to describe the status of the talks, saying Daewoo Motor, an affiliate of Daewoo
Group, had agreed not to reveal the content of the talks publicly.
BRIEFLY:
-- Thailand's trade surplus narrowed to $731.7 million in September from $1.30 billion a year earlier, the
government said in a preliminary report. Exports rose 8.3% to $5.06 billion, while imports surged 29% from a
year before to $4.33 billion.

EUROPE/AFRICA
U.K. Producer Prices Show Uptick
Tentative signs that rising producer input prices in Britain are beginning to feed through to inflation at the
factory gate set off few alarm bells yesterday. Analysts said the data won't cause too much concern at the
Bank of England because manufacturers are still having difficulty passing on rising costs to consumers. The
government reported producer output prices rose 0.3% in September from August and were up 1.7%
year-to-year, stronger than expected rises of 0.1% and 1.5%, respectively. The annual rise was last higher in
December 1996, when it was 1.9%.
Lonmin Bids for Rest of Ashanti
British mining company Lonmin has offered to buy the 68% of shares in Ashanti Goldfields that it doesn't
already own. Ashanti, a gold-mining company based in Ghana, has been struggling to come up with about
$270 million to pay creditors for margin calls on futures contracts for the sale of gold; the company, which
had hedged 40% of its reserves against a fall in gold prices, was surprised by gold's recent surge. Under its
offer, Lonmin would pay 32 new Lonmin shares for every 43 Ashanti shares it doesn't own. People familiar
with the offer said the price for the stake is expected to be about GBP 335 million ($553 million). Ghana's
government holds 20% of Ashanti and has the power to veto a deal.
Britain's GEC to Become Marconi PLC
Britain's General Electric Co. PLC said it will change its name to Marconi PLC, following the planned merger
of its Marconi Electronics Systems business with British Aerospace. GEC said it expects that Marconi PLC
will be listed on the London Stock Exchange and will be a constituent of the FTSE-100 index. The United
Kingdom electronics company, which isn't related to General Electric of the U.S., said it also plans to seek a
U.S. listing next year.
Baird to Acquire Granville of Britain
British investment bank Granville struck a deal with Robert W. Baird & Co., a unit of Northwestern Mutual Life
Insurance of the U.S., that will let Granville keep its name, management and a degree of independence. The
deal values Granville at GBP 33 million ($54.5 million) and will create a bank with combined assets of $4.4
billion. The new bank, to be called Granville Baird, will in effect become Baird's European arm.
BRIEFLY:
-- South Africa and the European Union, after more than four years of negotiations, signed a free-trade pact.
The agreement proposes abolishing tariffs on about 90% of two-way trade between South Africa and the EU
that exceeds $17 billion annually.
-- Italian bank Unicredito Italiano is likely to form a joint venture with Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya that will
result in a share swap, people close to the banks said. The swap would be based primarily on Unicredito
buying BBV's 10.1% stake in Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. Unicredito is Italy's largest bank by market value,
while BBV is Spain's No. 2 bank.
-- The U.S. should drop its opposition to discussing antitrust policy in the framework of the next round of
world-trade talks, the European Union's competition commissioner said. The U.S. opposes such talks on the
grounds they are premature as long as many countries have no functioning antitrust agencies.
-- French chefs protesting against value-added taxes pelted surprised Paris riot police with eggs and flour,
prompting police to respond with tear gas to keep the protesters away from Parliament.

THE AMERICAS
Mexican Agency to Probe Bad Loans
Mexico's bank-deposit insurance agency, known as IPAB, said it is conducting an in-depth investigation into
about 48 billion pesos ($5.07 billion) of bad commercial-bank loans the government assumed in the 1995
bank-bailout program. "Depending on the results of these reviews, the cases that have been determined to be
based on some irregularities will be turned over to the competent authorities," IPAB said. Under a Mexican
congressional agreement, only loans of legal origin are to be assumed by IPAB.
Nexfor to Acquire Rest of CSC Forest
Canadian forest-products company Nexfor said it will boost its interest in CSC Forest Products to 100% from
50% as part of its continuing strategy to be more focused and pursue growth of its panelboard businesses.
Nexfor said CSC Forest is a joint venture in Britain with Glunz of Germany. It said it will exercise its right
under the joint-venture pact to acquire Glunz's 50% stake in CSC for GBP 50 million ($83 million) and will
assume Glunz's share of CSC's debt of about GBP 25 million.
BRIEFLY:
-- Foreign investment in Mexico's stock market in September rose 0.7% from the month before to $46.50
billion, the Mexican Stock Exchange reported.

Dollar Slips in Thin Holiday Trading; Focus Turns to Bank of Japan Meeting

NEW YORK -- The dollar weakened slightly against the yen and euro in moribund holiday-thinned trading.
Financial markets were closed in Japan and Canada, and U.S. bond markets were closed for Columbus Day,
though the New York Stock Exchange was open.
In Europe, currency players shrugged off data showing euro-zone second-quarter gross domestic product
was revised up to 0.5% growth from the 0.3% growth reported earlier.
Volume may prove light today as well, if market participants choose to sit on the sidelines ahead of an
important Bank of Japan meeting tomorrow.
Some Japanese newspapers have speculated that the central bank might ease policy by purchasing
short-dated bonds, but many analysts see this as highly unlikely.
"I just think the BOJ feels things are on track fundamentally . . . that there's enough macro stimulus," said
Larry Hatheway, global head of strategy at Warburg Dillon Read in Stamford, Conn., pointing out that Japan's
banking system is past its worst point and another huge fiscal-stimulus package is in the works.
But, "the market still has uncertainties," Mr. Hatheway added.
Since Group of Seven finance ministers issued a statement against yen strength on Sept. 25, the dollar has
stabilized off 44-month lows against the yen. The dollar, which was in free fall for the latter part of the third
quarter, bottomed out at 103.20 yen on Sept. 15 but has more recently recovered to a range around 107 yen.
If that dollar recovery was predicated on expected changes in Japanese monetary policy, the dollar risks
sinking on no-change announcements, according to analysts.
The dollar is supported, however, by signs that asset reallocation into yen-based investments is nearly
finished. In the week ended Oct. 1, non-Japanese investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks for the first
time on a weekly basis since Aug. 13, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported last week.
The dollar is also helped by stability in U.S. stocks, despite the Federal Reserve's bias toward raising interest
rates.
Investors will look to U.S. retail-sales data on Thursday and producer-price data on Friday for more clues on
the likelihood of an imminent rate increase.
Meanwhile, "the euro is still essentially undervalued," Mr. Hatheway said. "As long as the German data
continue to print higher, the euro will continue to grind higher."
But the euro's progress is hampered by heavy positioning and clouded by concerns about German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's ability to deliver promised reforms. The ruling Social Democrats on Sunday
suffered election losses in Berlin, following setbacks the past several weeks in state elections across
Germany.
Late Monday in New York, the dollar was trading at 106.82 yen, down from 107.39 yen late Friday. The euro
was trading at $1.0647, up from $1.0628. The euro was also changing hands at 113.72 yen, below 114.30
yen.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6528, up from $1.6517.

Elsewhere, the South African rand weakened in line with softer gold prices. The dollar was trading at 6.0705
rand late yesterday in Johannesburg, up from 6.0400 rand late Friday.
The Indian rupee strengthened alongside rallies in local stocks, on euphoria about the Bharatiya Janata
Party's recent strong victory in federal elections.
The U.S. dollar closed in local trading at 43.37 rupees, down from 43.43 rupees Friday. The rupee has been
rising since election results were announced Thursday, as the win by the BJP and its centrist coalition of 24
parties has encouraged investors' hopes of political stability and economic reform.

NEW YORK -- The dollar inched lower against the euro and yen but held solidly in the week's ranges as the
European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged and U.S. assets marked time ahead of a key jobs
report.
Aside from a bit of volatility immediately following the ECB announcement, foreign-exchange trading was
quiet yesterday. The euro initially sank on the announcement but snapped back up, continuing to consolidate
last week's threecent gain.
In the currency market overall, "there are a lot of mixed signals and not a real clear direction," said Andrew
Busch, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in Chicago. The Dow Jones industrial average
shed 51.29 points and the 30-year Treasury bond was flat.
While the euro finished up from Wednesday's close, it spent the day below Wednesday's high of $1.0780.
Many traders say the currency needs to crack this level by next week and make a stab at its August high of
$1.0830 before longer-term money buys into the euro's recovery.
That test isn't likely to come today, unless September U.S. payrolls show a big jump in wages and U.S.
assets are further rattled by the increased chance of a Federal Reserve rate increase.
The Fed on Tuesday left rates unchanged but announced a bias toward raising them in the future with a
watchful eye on the potential for labor costs to outstrip productivity gains.
On the headline numbers, forecasts call for a 220,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, though there may be
some irregularity because of Hurricane Floyd. The unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at
4.2%.
The ECB no-change announcement yesterday was largely as expected, though the newly hawkish tone of
ECB officials meant there was an outside chance the bank would raise rates. ECB President Wim Duisenberg
reiterated yesterday that upward risks to price stability and M3 money growth are growing, fueling speculation
that the bank will raise before year end. Its main refinancing rate is 2.50%.
The Bank of England also held steady yesterday, leaving its official dealing rate unchanged at 5.25%. Sterling
slipped against the dollar and euro following the as-expected announcement, amid signs that the currency
had overextended its recent bull run anyway.
The dollar slid lower against the yen in late trading, but held above 107.00 yen and finished only slightly
below Wednesday's close.
Some analysts warn that the yen could resume its third-quarter rally if an additional fiscal stimulus package
this fall proves larger than initial estimates and if Japanese monetary conditions remain unchanged.
In New York, the dollar was trading at 107.26 yen, down from 107.58 Wednesday. The euro was trading at
$1.0713, up from $1.0688. The euro was also worth 115.02 yen, flat from 115.03 yen.
Sterling was worth $1.6517, below $1.6548.
Elsewhere, the South African rand was lower but stable yesterday, in sync with stabilizing gold prices. The
U.S. dollar was worth 6.0550 rand late in Johannesburg, unchanged from a day earlier.

The Canadian dollar ticked lower but was essentially unchanged, and traders cited market caution ahead of
the U.S. jobs report. Canada also reports its September jobs data today. The U.S. dollar was worth
C$1.4709, from C$1.4690 a day earlier.
The Brazilian real strengthened, boosted by a government auction of U.S.dollar-linked notes and lower-house
approval late Wednesday of social security reforms. In afternoon trading ahead of the close, the U.S.
currency was worth 1.9340 real, down from 1.9520 real at Wednesday's close.

Dollar Strengthens With Stock Market, Rises Against Both the Euro and the Yen

NEW YORK -- The dollar followed stocks higher as the 187.75-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
proved investors weren't deterred by the tightening bias adopted by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday.
The U.S. currency clawed its way back from early losses to end higher against both the euro and yen, as the
industrial average's gains shifted optimism from Europe to the U.S.
"But, the market is so much on tenterhooks," said Michael Carey, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais SA in
New York. Yesterday's dollar gains could be today's losses in such a finicky market.
But there were plenty of reasons for uncertainty one day before key central-bank meetings in the euro zone
and United Kingdom, especially with Japanese economic policy making still shrouded by obscurity.
In fact, what looked like a positive day for the euro early in global trading didn't turn out that way.
The common currency hit a fresh, two-month high of $1.0780 after German manufacturing data showed
orders surging 5.1% in August, much stronger than the 0.5% increase forecast by analysts.
With data pointing to an improving outlook for growth and the recent spate of hawkish comments from
European central bankers, analysts say there is a chance the European Central Bank could tighten
monetary policy as early as today.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 107.58 yen, up from 106.47 yen late Tuesday. The euro
was at $1.0688, down from $1.0735 Tuesday.
Jacques Delpla, European economist at Barclays Capital in Paris, said his bank now expects the ECB to
raise rates a quarter of a percent by Nov. 4 and to send hawkish signs today.
Against the yen, the dollar continues higher, as financial markets find few definitive indications of the what
kind of supplementary budget Japan is planning.
Markets, which have been enamored with Japan's growth prospects and eager to take the yen higher, found
the lack of budget clarity a risk to Japan's recovery.
As for the yen, Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs, seemed intent on
issuing a reprimand to any lingering yen enthusiasts.
Speaking to reporters at Japan's finance ministry, Mr. Kuroda said: "I think the G7 communique is being
digested by the market little by little. But it has not been understood enough." With that, the dollar shot off its
intraday lows and didn't look back, remaining above 107.50 yen for the rest of the trading day.
Sterling slipped slightly one day before the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee concludes its
monthly rate review.
Late yesterday in New York, sterling was buying $1.6548, down from $1.6557 Tuesday. The U.K. currency
traded as high as $1.6585 yesterday, finding support in more bullish U.K. economic data.
Strong reports on U.K. manufacturing, industrial production and retail sales buoyed the pound and added to
speculation that the BOE would again move to tighten monetary policy.
Last month, the bank surprised markets by raising its repo rate 0.25 percentage point to 5.25% in what it
called a pre-emptive move against inflation. Since the rate increase, sterling has appreciated 3.6% against
the dollar.

Worries about an impending tightening in U.S. monetary policy spread to South Africa, where weaker gold
prices were already rocking markets. The rand skidded sharply lower against the dollar.
Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 6.0550 rand from 5.9875 rand Tuesday.

Bond Prices Fall as Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged But Signals That It Might Tighten in the Future

NEW YORK -- Bond prices tumbled as the Federal Reserve left interest rates alone, as expected, but
indicated there may be enough inflationary pressure building in the economy to necessitate raising interest
rates in the months ahead.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was down 1 7/32, or $12.1875 for a bond with a $1,000
face value, at 99 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves inversely to the price, climbed to 6.173% from 6.083%.
Medium-term bonds also dropped sharply. Ten-year Treasurys, for example, fell 24/32 to yield 6.029%.
The jump in yields puts pressure on various other rates, like credit-card and mortgage rates, pinching
consumers in the pocketbook.
Investors are worried bond prices will keep going lower. "People are focusing on the next move, as they
always do with the Fed, and there's an expectation that there will be one more move by the Fed [to raise
rates] before the end of the year," said Robert Kapito, who manages $142 billion at BlackRock in New York.
"The tightening bias affirms that the Fed could [raise rates] on or before the November meeting," said Chris
Fitzmaurice, head trader at Salomon Smith Barney, who says the 30-year bond's yield could hit 6.75% in next
year's first quarter.
The Fed left its short-term interest-rate target -- the federal funds rate -- unchanged, as expected by Wall
Street economists and traders. (The federal-funds rate governs overnight loans between banks.) But the Fed
indicated it was leaning toward raising rates in the future, a so-called tightening bias that came as something
of a surprise to some bond investors nervous and instantly sent the market tumbling after the 2:15 p.m. EDT
announcement.
"The Federal Open Market Committee will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for
costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation
pressures and undermine the impressive performance of the economy," the policy-making panel said in a
statement.
Some said the lack of a move on interest rates, and the shift in the Fed's bias, created an imposing cloud
that will hang over the market in the weeks ahead.
"We're back to being worried about oil, gold and the economy, and now the Fed is putting us on notice that
they think they're going to tighten in the future," said Bill Hornbarger, chief income strategist at A.G. Edwards
& Sons in St. Louis. "That's the way the market perceives it, even if the Fed didn't mean to be so hawkish."
Indeed, investors immediately began to worry about a rate increase when the FOMC meets again on Nov. 16.
Though year 2000 is around the corner, and many remain worried about the effects any computer-related
glitches will have on world economies, the Fed has indicated that it is less concerned about the economic
effects of such computer problems, and could in fact raise rates next month, analysts noted.
Some traders began to anticipate the yield on the 30-year bond heading past 6.3% if the September
employment numbers, due out Friday, prove strong.
"The key report is employment on Friday, and the wage-gain component in particular, because the Fed is
now indicating that they'll keep a close eye on whether there's a labor shortage, and it's appropriate for the
market to as well," said Richard Schwartz, who manages $23 billion at New York Life Asset Management,
Parsippany, N.J. Mr. Schwartz is avoiding buying bonds before the report comes out. "The market has taken
on a negative tone."

Corporate Bonds
Sprint debt saw heavy trading in the wake of MCI WorldCom's deal to acquire the company.
Yield margins to Treasurys for 30-year Sprint securities, which had narrowed recently, widened slightly to
1.42 percentage points on profit-taking, traders said. Yield margins on MCI WorldCom's 30-year debt were
unchanged around 1.35 percentage points over Treasurys.
Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed ratings on MCI WorldCom's long-term debt and put
Sprint long-term ratings on review for possible upgrade. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services put MCI
WorldCom and Sprint on CreditWatch with positive implications.
WorldCom is rated single-A-3 by Moody's and single-A-minus by S&P while Sprint is rated Baa1 by Moody's
and triple-B-plus by S&P. Most analysts said ratings of the combined company should hover around MCI
WorldCom's single-A levels.
Mortgage-Backed Securities
Mortgage-backed securities ended lower along with Treasurys. Among benchmark issues, Fannie Mae 7.5%
securities were off 14/32 at 99 26/32.
The sector had performed more strongly than Treasurys until an investor made a major late-session sale of
7% and 7.5% securities, traders said.
Issuance of mortgage-backed securities has been ebbing as rising interest rates have discouraged
refinancings of home mortgages, resulting in fewer loans to securitize.
However, this week, Fannie Mae announced a $1.175 billion stripped MBS trust, or securities that are broken
into separate portions paying either principal or interest.
Fannie Mae SMBS Trust 303 was expected to see good demand because it is the first such transaction in
about 18 months to have a 7.5% coupon, reflecting recent increases in interest rates. Other transactions
recently have had 7% coupons.

Dollar Retreats From Its Early Surge After Fed Makes No Change in Rates

NEW YORK -- The dollar, which spent much of the day edging higher against the yen and euro, shed those
gains in a hurry following the U.S. Federal Reserve's afternoon announcement of no change in interest rates,
but a bias toward raising them in the future.
When the dust settled, the dollar finished Tuesday up slightly against the yen and euro from levels late
Monday, but with subdued gains overall.
The Fed decision is expected to weigh on the dollar -- especially against the resurgent euro -- as long as U.S.
assets struggle in a rate-tightening environment.
"There's no new incentive to buy financial assets at this stage of the game," said Kathy Jones, currency
analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.
The change in bias means investors must remain on guard against creeping price and wage pressures -- on
the possibility the Federal Open Market Committee might raise interest rates when it next meets on Nov. 16.
"The outlook for long-term yields is negative, which is problematic for foreign investors," said Kathleen
Stephansen, chief international economist at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette in New York, anticipating a
continued rebalancing of portfolios away from U.S. assets.
The Fed's decision was right in line with consensus expectations. Fed officials, in their statement, noted the
FOMC "will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly
in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures and undermine the
impressive performance of the economy."
Helping keep dollar losses in check Tuesday was a bit of market nervousness ahead of a European Central
Bank meeting later this week and signs that the euro's recent strong rally needs a some technical
consolidation before proceeding further.
The euro, which was trading at around $1.0690 right before the FOMC announcement at 2:12 p.m. EDT, shot
to a high of $1.0763 in the hour following the announcement, but never seriously challenged Monday's high of
$1.0772.
The euro had taken a knock in early European trading Tuesday after worse-than-anticipated German
employment data damped speculation that the ECB might raise rates as soon as Thursday.
While the German jobless rate fell to 10.1% in September from 10.3% in August, the number of German
jobless rose 9,000 in the month on the heels of a 4,000 gain in August and far exceeding forecasts.
The dollar held even firmer against the yen. The U.S. currency fell to a New York low of about 106.30 yen
after the announcement, from 106.95 yen just before the announcement, but its decline was well within the
day's range.
In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 106.47 yen, up from 106.26 late Monday. The euro was
at $1.0735, down from $1.0738. The euro was at 114.30 yen, up from 114.14 yen. Sterling was at $1.6557,
essentially flat from $1.6553.
Elsewhere, the South African rand strengthened as gold resumed its strong rally. The U.S. dollar was worth
5.9875 rand late Tuesday in Johnannesburg, down from 6.0025 rand late Monday.

The Australian dollar, which finds support from rising gold prices, continued to struggle amid heavy
positioning. It set a three-month high of 66.62 U.S. cents Tuesday but fell to 66.29 U.S. cents by the New
York close, nearly flat with 66.27 U.S. cents a day earlier.
The Thai baht spiked higher after Thailand's central bank tightened the rules governing onshore loans to
offshore markets. The U.S. dollar closed in Bangkok worth 39.500 baht, down from 40.425 baht late Monday,
and the tighter liquidity is expected to continue to buoy the baht.
The Bank of Thailand announced it would impose a 50 million-baht ceiling on loans to nonresidents, and all
branches of an onshore head office are now considered one counterparty.

Commodities' Role as Inflation Harbinger Ebbs

Corrections & Amplifications
THE DOW JONES-AIG COMMODITY Index, which isn't as energy-reliant as some other measures of
commodity prices, is up about 17% for the year. Yesterday's Commodities column incorrectly stated that the
index was down 26% for the year. (WSJ Oct. 7, 1999)
Copper prices have risen about 22% this year. Nickel is up more than 70%, gold 13%, platinum 11%, silver
11% and oil a startling 92%. Overall, the Bridge/CRB index of 17 commodities has risen about 6%.
But the U.S. core consumer price index is up just 1.9% from a year ago. And while that may have edged up a
bit from the inflation rate earlier this year, most economists say inflation appears to be well under control.
How can that be? Haven't higher commodity prices historically translated quickly into higher inflation?
True. But for two main reasons, it is different now -- so far, anyway. In general, many experts say
commodities' role as an inflation indicator has diminished in recent years as the economy has become more
service-oriented and technology-driven.
"What does the price of crude oil have to do with the Internet?" Jeff Applegate, chief investment strategist at
Lehman Brothers asks rhetorically. "Not much."
And in particular, economists say the latest commodity boom has left behind some resource prices, notably
agricultural products such as wheat and soybeans that have remained flat. Others, such as oil and gold, had
been so deflated that their recent price spikes have been taken more as a return to price levels that are
simply more normal, not necessarily inflated.
"Commodity prices are still at the low end of what we've seen for the 1990s as a whole, so I wouldn't be
worrying about inflation quite yet," said Jim Glassman, senior U.S. economist at Chase Securities Inc. in
New York. In the energy sector, Mr. Glassman said Americans since the 1970s are using about 40% less
power per dollar of gross domestic product -- a sign that fuel costs hold much less sway than they used to
over the rest of the economy.
Many of the latest price increases don't have to do with demand increases that might spur more-serious
inflation worries. With copper, for example, production cuts are the issue: Prices have risen steadily in part
because of consolidation among major mining firms. Gold, meanwhile, has moved on supply cutbacks:
Prices jumped a total of $56.50 since last week to $324.40 an ounce after 15 European central banks said
they wouldn't sell or lease additional gold for the next five years. Although that was music to many gold
traders' ears, economists said it had little to do with consumer purchasing power.
But in recent years, that has increasingly been true of commodity prices in general, as the price of everything
from grains to lumber has become less of a component in the price of finished goods, says Bill O'Neill,
director of commodity research for Merrill Lynch.
"If you buy a loaf of bread, I think the cost of the wheat to make it is something like five cents of the price," he
said. "It's just not the factor that it used to be." Mr. Glassman says another good example of a commodity
whose inflationary role has diminished is natural gas.
Instead, inflationary indicators such as the price of computers, which has been falling, and labor, which
makes up 70% of the cost of many finished goods, have become more important, says economist Chris
Varvares, of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis.

--- Page 140 ---
Page 140 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"Commodities prices now are more of an indicator of how the world economy is doing, particularly in
commodity-producing countries that have not had economies as strong as the U.S. lately," Mr. Varvares says.
"The prices we've seen lately are less an indicator that the U.S. is falling behind than that those other
countries' economies are doing better."
Economists are also quick to note that many agricultural commodities have either decreased in value, remain
in oversupply or are near historic low prices even if they have gone up.
"There's a complete dichotomy," Mr. O'Neill says. "Yes, commodities will probably trend modestly higher next
year, and there's probably some more inflation in the pipeline," he says. "But there's not acute inflation."
Unease about inflation has smoldered since the Federal Reserve's two interestrate increases this summer.
However, the central bank decided not to increase interest rates at its meeting yesterday, despite higher
commodities costs.
Recent moves in major commodities indexes demonstrate who the winners and losers have been in the
industry. Since hitting a low of 183.22 July 13, the Bridge/CRB Index has been rising steadily, punctuated by
its reaching a high for 1999 on this past week's gold rally. The index closed at 203.16 yesterday, 4.90 below
its peak at 208.06 of a week ago, says Bob Hafer, the index's managing director.
The energy-heavy Goldman Sachs Commodity Index closed at 2619.26, up 33% for the year. By contrast, the
more agricultural-based The Dow Jones-AIG futures index was at 90.916, down 26% for the year. The
Goldman Sachs index has been buoyed by an increase in crude oil and other energy prices that began in the
spring. Many analysts said those prices -- at least for now -- are better indicators of inflationary pressure than
gold.
"The gold price is going to fluctuate wildly for a little while as the mining companies and investors sort it out
for themselves," says Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State
University in Atlanta. "Once it finds its level, you could then start to use it again as more of an inflation
barometer."
But he cautions that one inflationary worry that is reflected in the latest gold surge, to a limited degree, is the
lack of a single currency to truly impress investors as a store of value.
"Not everyone wants to jump on the yen bandwagon," Mr. Ratajczak says, referring to the Japanese
currency's recent rally against the U.S. dollar. He said lingering concerns about the Japanese government's
monetary policy and the permanence of the country's recovery have limited investors' excitement about the
yen.
The irony is that the moratorium on new gold sales and the rally it created are to a certain extent reflections
of the governments' own recent success in keeping inflation low, says Wayne D. Angell, chief economist at
Bear Stearns. "The reason why the Bank of England decided to sell [its] gold is that the Federal Reserve was
doing such a good job keeping inflation down," says Mr. Angell, who also is a former Fed governor; he was
referring to a British government plan announced in May to auction 415 tons of its gold.
The trucking industry provides a useful example of the relative effect commodity prices now have on
companies, compared with the effect from other economic changes, said Bob Costello, economist for the
trade group American Trucking Associations Inc. He said surging oil prices have been a concern to truckers.
But the tight labor market has been an almostequal worry.
The annual turnover rate for truckers has swelled to 95% recently, forcing some carriers to spend more to
entice workers with better benefits, more comfortable vehicles, and in some cases, higher wages, Mr.
Costello said.
"What we're seeing in labor is very similar to what you'd see in other elements of the economy, even the
high-tech industry," he said. "People are changing jobs much more than they used to."
In other commodity markets:
HOGS: Futures fell the daily limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as U.S. slaughter levels mounted. The
October contract fell two cents to 48.2 cents a pound. The Agriculture Department estimated yesterday's U.S.
slaughter at 388,000 head, the same as Monday's, putting this week's slaughter 4,000 ahead of a week ago
and 16,000 ahead of the same week last year. "We're killing too many," said Leo Burns, trader with Iowa
Grain at the exchange. The fear is that product demand won't keep up with rising pork supplies.
COFFEE: Futures settled sharply higher at the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York
Board of Trade as speculators bought amid nervousness about dry conditions in Brazil. Nearby December
futures rose 2.2 cents to 85.05 cents a pound. Rainfall in Brazilian coffee-growing areas has been scattered

Tokyo's Over-the-Counter Stock Market Continues To Gain, Suggesting the End of a Bear Market

Global markets turned in a mixed performance on a day when the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates
unchanged, but Tokyo's over-the-counter stock market extended its recent tear.
The Nikkei OTC index closed higher for the seventh consecutive session -- a gain of 12.3% over that period --
continuing to defy skeptics who believe that the market's threefold increase from a year ago makes it ripe for
a significant correction.
Tokyo's blue-chip benchmark, meanwhile, gained just 0.1% with most investors adopting a cautious stance
as the market closed ahead of the Fed policy meeting. Investors were bolder in Malaysia, where news of
possible early elections helped lift the index 4%, and in South Korea, where new charges of tax evasion
against some of the country's most prominent businesses sent stocks plunging again.
European markets, which also closed before the Fed elected to leave rates the same but adopted a
tightening bias, generally finished higher with some strong performances from the auto and technology
sectors. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.10, or 0.05%, to 218.55. Excluding the U.S., the
index rose 0.49, or 0.30%, to 164.85.
The Nikkei 225 Index has surged 39% since last October, but those gains have been trounced by the OTC
market of Japanese small-stock companies. Many investors say a correction is long overdue. But recent
trends still seem to favor these stocks over the blue-chip exporters, which remain much more vulnerable to a
strengthening yen.
"Smaller companies are more closely correlated with a recovering economy," notes Eric Ritter, portfolio
manager of the Driehaus Asia-Pacific Growth Fund in Chicago. "So as [gross domestic product] figures come
in positive, people are turning to these stocks."
What's more, the recent deregulation of brokerage trading fees is expected to lure more Japanese individual
investors back into the Tokyo market, where many are already active in OTC stocks.
In fact, OTC volume on Oct. 1, the day the new trading rules came into effect, was 124 billion yen -- the
heaviest figure of the year, according to Daiwa Securities. The firm also notes that cumulative trading volume
since January stands at more than 7 trillion yen. That exceeds the total over the same period during 1990's
record year.
If signs that Japan's recession has bottomed out helped ignite the OTC rally, investors say the initial catalyst
was the government's loan-guarantee package established last October to encourage banks to lend to small
companies. At the time, smaller firms had been especially prone to bankruptcy, and with nonperforming loans
running high, banks were reluctant to extend credit to these riskier companies.
Unlike the Nasdaq Stock Market in the U.S., Japan's OTC market is not thoroughly dominated by high-tech
start-ups; manufacturing companies account for a good portion of the listings. But like the U.S., health-care
and technology-related companies have been among the smallstock market's biggest gainers.
Trend Micro, an anti-computer-virus software company, fell 2.1% to 14,000 yen on profit-taking yesterday
after soaring more than 70% during the recent OTC rally. Yahoo Japan also slipped yesterday, 4.7% to 45
million yen. But as a primary online advertising vehicle, the company is expected to profit from online broker
advertisements under the more competitive era of deregulation.
Meanwhile, the share price of Goodwill, a temporary employment agency, has more than doubled to 70
million yen following its July initial public offering.

More broadly, Alexander Kinmont of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said the surge in OTC stocks suggests that
Tokyo's 10-year-old bear market is over. The Japanese equity strategist noted during a speech in Tokyo
yesterday that three bear markets in the U.S. ended when smallstock gains outpaced those of larger stocks.
The Tokyo market, he said, is "getting into a change between a bear and bull market."
In SEOUL, the Kospi Index plummeted 26.82, or 3.3%, to 791.55. The market initially gained on ratings
upgrades of five South Korean banks by Moody's Investors Service. But stock prices turned sharply lower in
the afternoon on concern about a stream of tax-evasion charges and other allegations by the government
against some of the country's most prominent businesses and their managers. The National Tax Service said
it will ask prosecutors to investigate Hanjin Group for alleged tax evasion and foreign currency violations.
Hanjin Heavy Industries fell 15% to 5740.
In KUALA LUMPUR, the Composite Index jumped 27.37, or 4%, to 710.23. With an improving economy and
a tired opposition, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is expected to call for elections soon. Interest in some
banking stocks was fueled by Mr. Mahathir's remarks over the weekend, which suggested the number of core
banks in the merger program could be revised. RHB Capital shares rose 30 sen to 2.94 ringgit. Multi-Purpose
Holdings ended up 12 sen at 1.85 ringgit.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index closed 31.6 points higher at 6084.5, a gain of 0.5%. News that mining
group Lonmin is in merger talks with African gold producer Ashanti Goldfields, combined with a rally in the
price of gold to lift the sector. Billiton shares climbed 13.75 pence, or 5.4%, to 268.25 pence; Anglo American
added 101 pence, or 2.9%, to close at 3541 pence; and RioTinto rose 46 pence, or 4.4%, to 1089 pence. The
deadly rail crash at London's Paddington station yesterday tuesNo hit shares in Railtrack, which owns and
operates the rail infrastructure. Railtrack fell 12 pence to 1319 pence.
In FRANKFURT, the Xetra DAX Index gained 82.99 points, or 1.6%, at 5301.85. Shares of auto maker
DaimlerChrysler posted a 3.6% gain to 68.25 euros on a report that the company may relocate its
headquarters to the U.S., where it would enjoy certain tax benefits. The company later denied the report.
Deutsche Telekom shares got some support from news it would be willing to sell its 10% stake in Sprint Corp.
to pursue further expansion. Its shares gained 1.7% to 39.83 euros. MCI WorldCom reached an agreement to
take over Sprint in a deal valued at more than $115 billion.
In PARIS, the CAC 40 Index rose 1.3%, or 57.89 points, to close at 4661.13. France Telecom shares soared
3.7% to 84.25 euros. Tech stocks also rallied in response to early tech gains in the U.S. Nasdaq Stock
Market-listed data carrier Equant climbed 6.4% to 82.20 euros, while memory-chip maker STMicroelectronics
ended 5.3% higher at 78.85 euros.

Financial and Growth Stocks Rise Amid Optimism for Fed's Plans

NEW YORK -- Investors betting that Alan Greenspan will take it easy on interest rates at today's policy
meeting bid up shares of financial and growth stocks.
American Express rose 6 3/16 to 137 9/16, and Chase Manhattan, despite some pessimism from a Brown
Bros. analyst, rose 3 11/16 to 77 5/16.
Blue-chip technology stocks progressed, as investors anticipated that the Federal Reserve won't crunch the
multiples by raising rates at Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) gained 4 17/32 to 96 17/32. International Business Machines moved ahead 2
1/2 to 119 7/8. EMC gained 3 5/8 to 76 1/2.
Other growth stocks also made some improvement, as General Electric, expected to report its third-quarter
results later this week, advanced 2 11/16 to 120 1/16, Wal-Mart Stores rose 2 to 50 5/16, and General Motors
increased 1 15/16 to 64 3/16.
Some consumer stocks also rose. Colgate-Palmolive gained 2 1/8 to 49 15/16, after a J.P. Morgan upgrade.
Procter & Gamble rose 2 13/16 to 96 1/4. Philip Morris, trading near a 52-week low, rose 5/8 to 34 5/8.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session 128.23 points better, a gain of 1.25%, at 10401.23.
Volume totals for the session didn't show an all-out rush to get into the market ahead of the Fed decision.
With 795.9 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the volume trailed the 891.8
million shares that changed hands Friday, and nothing near the more than one billion shares that
accompanied Thursday's 123.47-point improvement in the Dow industrials. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index increased 21.79, or 1.7%, to close at 1304.60.
Some glaring holes opened. Consumer blue-chip stocks worked their way higher. But Coca-Cola traded at
another 52-week low, closing at 47 9/16, down 1 1/2.
Shortcomings on the earnings front also arose. Hewlett-Packard fell 4 1/8 to 83 1/4, after Merrill Lynch said
the computer maker's fourth-quarter results could be even lower than the company projected in its conference
call Friday.
Meanwhile, prices of precious metals continued to rise, and analysts said they wouldn't be surprised to see
the rally last longer, and take prices higher, than anybody anticipated a week ago. Gold prices haven't
sustained significant gains for most of this bull market in equities. Shares of several metals stocks increased,
as well. Barrick Gold rose 1 5/8 to 24, Newmont Mining increased 3 3/16 to 29 3/4, and Placer Dome rose 1
3/16 to 16 9/16.
Meanwhile, merger activity -- something that has been part and parcel of the bull market -- contributed some
measure of optimism to the session.
Sprint gained 3 7/8 to 60 7/8 as BellSouth, attempting to thwart MCI WoldCom, made a bid to buy the
telecommunications-service firm. BellSouth fell 2 11/16 to 42 11/16; MCI WorldCom (Nasdaq) increased 1 1/8
to 71 5/8. Last night, Sprint agreed to be acquired by MCI.
A host of other telecommunications stocks perked up, including Bell Atlantic, which gained 3 1/8 to 69 1/2,
GTE, which rose 1 to 77 3/4, and AT&T, which rose 2 to 43 3/4.

Clear Channel Communications fell 3 7/8 to 76 1/2. The San Antonio broadcasting and media concern
agreed to buy broadcaster AMFM in a deal valued at $16.58 billion. AMFM, Irving, Texas, rose 1 5/16 to 65
3/16.
RCN (Nasdaq) rose 7 21/32 to 45 23/32. Paul Allen, the investor and co-founder of Microsoft, is investing
$1.65 billion in RCN, a Princeton, N.J., telecommunications and Internet-services provider. Along with the
4.9% stake Mr. Allen holds in the company, he could end up with the equivalent of 26.7% of the company.
Sabre Holdings advanced 6 1/8 to 49 1/2. The Fort Worth, Texas, airline-data concern will merge its
Travelocity.com online travel unit with Preview Travel, retaining a 70% stake in the new public company. The
new company has a five-year contract with America Online to become the exclusive-reservation engine in the
AOL realm, and said Yahoo! extended a contract with Travelocity. Yahoo also agreed to invest in the
company. AMR, which owns 82% of Sabre, moved ahead 5 3/8 to 59 1/4.
Other transports also made some progress, including UAL, which gained 2 7/8 to 67 1/8, Delta Air Lines,
which increased 3 1/16 to 50 5/8, and Northwest Airlines, which rose 1 3/4 to 26 3/4.
Oil stocks weakened after crude prices rose. Mobil fell 2 to 96 1/2. Chevron sank 2 3/16 to 86. Exxon fell 1
5/8 to 73.
JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq) gained 9 3/4 to 125. The San Jose, Calif., laser-based telecommunications-systems
maker will acquire Epitaxx, a Trenton, N.J., fiber-optics equipment maker, for $400 million in stock. Honeywell
gained 1 3/8 to 113 3/8, while AlliedSignal rose 3/4 to 60 11/16. The manufacturers reached an agreement
with the U.S. Justice Deparment for approval of their planned merger. Both will divest portions of their
avionics businesses.
Weatherford International, a Houston oilfield-service concern, followed the rest of the energy market lower,
even though Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the stock to a neutral from a buy, and put a $48 a share
price target on the stock. Shares closed 1 9/16 lower at 31 3/16.
Gemstar International (Nasdaq) fell 7 7/16 to 76 3/16. The Pasadena, Calif., developer of video products and
electronicprogramming guides, agreed to acquire TV Guide for $9.2 billion in stock. TV Guide (Nasdaq)
increased 4 13/32 to 45 15/16. Lehman Brothers said that, despite a stock price decline Monday, Gemstar
International should be a more-attractive investment following the acquisition.
Air Products & Chemicals gained 1 1/16 to 30 3/16. Credit Suisse First Boston said it expected the company,
which has traded near a 52-week high, to live up to quarterly earnings targets, and said shares could reach
48 going forward.
Mattel dropped 5 to 11 7/8, extending its 52-week low. The El Segundo, Calif., toy maker warned that its
third-quarter earnings would come in below what Wall Street has been anticipating, adding that revenue
would fall between 2% and 4% in the quarter. The company blamed an unexpected loss at its Learning Co.
unit. Merrill Lynch had lowered its rating on the stock Friday, and cut earnings estimates.
Hasbro, the second-largest toy maker behind Mattel, fell 1 3/4 to 20 5/16, and slipped near a 52-week low
intraday. Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating.
ST Microelectronics moved ahead 5 7/8 to 83 3/16. The French-Italian semiconductor developer said it and
Hitachi have completed the latest design in the SH series of microprocessors. The chips will be used in
consumer-electronics devices.
The American depositary receipts of Hitachi, a Japanese electronics maker, advanced 2 5/8 to 110 7/16.
Anheuser-Busch gained 1/4 to 72 1/8. Lehman Brothers made some optimistic comments about the stock,
saying that consumption trends had improved recently, and that pricing flexibility remained an asset to the
company.
Worries about some litigation risks continued to pressure stocks of managedcare companies. Aetna fell 1
9/16 to 49 11/16. Wellpoint Health Networks dropped 6 3/16 to 50 7/16. Cigna slipped 3 15/16 to 75 1/2.
Oxford Health Plans declined 1 7/16 to 11 1/8.

Stocks Help Lift Dollar Against Yen, but Euro Rises

Stocks Help Lift Dollar Against Yen, but Euro Rises

NEW YORK -- The dollar finished higher against the yen, helped by stronger U.S. stocks and Japan's
less-than-glittering tanken survey of business confidence.
But reports in the U.S. afternoon of falling German employment, leaked ahead of today's official release, gave
the euro a late-day boost, pushing it once again over the $1.0700 level.
That the euro could show such a burst of strength in the midst of a rally for U.S. stocks indicates how
enamored the market has become with the single currency, traders said.
Earlier in the day, the euro rose to a fresh two-month high of $1.0772, but was beaten back by gains in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Europe's improving growth potential and the outside chance that the European Central Bank might raise
interest rates as soon as its meeting Thursday have turned many euro bears into bulls in recent weeks.
Last week's hawkish comments from European Central Bank officials have increased the expectation that
the bank could follow the pre-emptive policy taken by the Bank of England.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 106.26 yen, up from 105.13 yen late Friday in New
York.
The euro was buying $1.0738, up from $1.0723. Sterling was priced at $1.6553, up from $1.6550.
As for the Japan's tankan, market players still aren't sure what to make of it.
The survey, released early yesterday, was a mixed bag, but proved yen-negative by the end of the day. While
it indicated business sentiment continues to improve, it also showed large companies remain cautious about
putting new money into plants and equipment.
But few players dared push the major currencies too far in either direction in a week chock full of
central-bank meetings.
"It's been a volatile couple of days," Stephen Jonathan, director of the foreignexchange desk at Merrill Lynch
in New York, said. "And now a lot of people are sidelined, because of all the central-bank meetings in the
next couple of days."
Today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee will be followed by meetings of the ECB
and Bank of England later in the week.
The expectation that the Fed will keep the rate unchanged at 5.25% isn't having much of a direct impact on
the dollar itself, but is lending support to the currency through the gains it has helped generate in U.S. stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day 128.23 points higher at 10401.23 from Friday's close of
10273.00.
In Latin America, Ecuador's sucre plunged 8.5% against the dollar as market players bought dollars, fearing
further financial turmoil will result from debt restructuring talks involving Ecuador's Brady Discount bonds.
On Friday, creditors demanded immediate repayment of $1.4 billion in Discounts. The demand was seen as
the latest salvo in what many believe will be a protracted battle between creditors and Ecuador, which is
attempting to restructure $6 billion in Brady debt.

Commodity-linked currency got a boost on higher gold prices.
The Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollar and South African rand all ended higher.
The December Comex contract rose $12.70 to close at $318.00 a troy ounce.
Late yesterday, the dollar was trading at $1.4685 Canadian dollars, down from C$1.4755 Friday in New York.

Bond Prices End Higher as Investors Speculate That Fed Policy Panel Won't Lift Rates Today

NEW YORK -- Bond prices rose as investors, betting the Federal Open Market Committee will refrain from
raising rates when it meets today, took advantage of beaten-down prices to scoop up Treasurys. Strength in
the dollar, and weakness among some key commodities, also helped the market's tone.
In late trading, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was up 19/32, or $5.9375 for a bond with a $1,000 face
value, at 100 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.083% from
6.127%.
Medium-term bonds also rose. Ten-year Treasurys, for example, climbed 8/32 to yield 5.927%.
Bonds tumbled on Friday, after the release of stronger-than-expected economic data. But yesterday some
investors saw value in Treasurys.
"The market was a little bit oversold, and while a small minority of people expect rates to be raised [today], it's
still a minority," said Bill Kirby, Prudential Securities' co-head of government trading.
While some investors took heart in the dollar's strength, and weakness in oil prices, most long-term investors
stayed on the sidelines, expecting that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee won't raise interest
rates for the third time this year.
Long-term investors such as mutual-fund portfolio managers "tend to be cautious ahead of the FOMC
meeting," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York. "Only a few
people would make a bold move" before the U.S. monetary policy makers meet.
The FOMC is expected to release its decision at about 2:15 p.m. EDT.
The fed-funds futures -- a proxy of the market's expectations on the federal-funds rate target for overnight
banking loans -- points to a less than 20% chance that rates will be raised today, traders said.
Still, stronger-than-expected National Association of Purchasing Management data on Friday have caused a
growing number of economists and investors to expect Federal Reserve policy makers to adopt a bias toward
higher rates -- also known as a policy directive.
"There's a strong probability that they will take a tightening bias, because they will want to put on record they
are concerned" about rising prices, said Carol Stone, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities
International in New York.
Oil prices have more than doubled since the beginning of the year, while gold has increased by $37 per
ounce, or 14%, since a week ago Friday, noted Barclays Capital.
As a result, "the bond market remains fearful of strong growth and the potential for more rate hikes to come,"
said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thomson in Chicago.
Separately, the Treasury sold 13-week and 26-week bills. Here are the results:

Junk Bonds
Merger-and-acquisition activity gave junk-bond investors reason to celebrate.
"We always buy bonds of companies that pass our credit standards from a fundamental standpoint," said
Fred Cavanaugh, high-yield portfolio manager at John Hancock Funds in Boston. "But when M&A activity
happens and our bonds gain, it's extra gravy."
Among the bonds in Mr. Cavanaugh's portfolio that rose on M&A-related activity were Nextel
Communications Inc.'s 9.75% notes, due 2007, which rose 1 1/2 points to 72 1/4 bid and 73 1/4 offered. The
bonds were up on speculation that the loser in the bidding war between BellSouth Corp. and MCI WorldCom
Inc. for Sprint Corp. will look to buy another company with a wireless reach across the U.S.
Elsewhere, bonds of RCN Corp. rallied after the company received a $1.65 billion investment from technology
magnate Paul Allen's Vulcan Ventures Inc. RCN's zero-coupon bonds due 2007 were up four points to 69 1/2
bid.
Overall, bids in the junk-bond market were up 1/4 point.

Bond Prices Slip for a Third Day Amid Worries About Inflation, Fed's Stance on Interest Rates

NEW YORK -- Treasury prices fell for a third consecutive day as strong economic data and higher commodity
prices continued to spur concern about inflation ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting.
People in the market don't expect Fed policy makers to raise interest rates when they meet Tuesday, a Dow
Jones/CNBC survey found. But some think the Fed might signal that another rate increase could come in the
near future by announcing it has altered its policy stance, or bias.
Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 18/32 point, or $5.625 for a bond with
$1,000 face value, at 99 29/32. Its yield rose to 6.122% from 6.081% late Tuesday, as bond yields move
inversely to prices.
Prices came under some pressure early on news that durable-goods orders jumped 0.9% in August,
compared with expectations for a 0.5% decline. Commodity prices also remained a focus. Although gold
prices fell, November crude oil ended 36 cents a barrel higher at $24.69.
Despite the sell-off in bonds, however, the Treasury found reasonably good demand for about $15 billion in
new two-year notes, people in the market said.
This week's gains in commodity prices have helped spur nervousness in a cautious bond market. But broad
gauges of U.S. inflation haven't shown much change recently -- an important reason why economists at 28
primary dealers in U.S. securities don't expect the Fed to raise rates, the Dow Jones/CNBC survey found.
Another reason cited by economists in the survey is that in August, after increasing short-term rates for the
second time this year by 0.25 percentage point, the Fed said that rate move should significantly reduce the
threat of inflation.
But, economists added, the Fed clearly remains concerned about the sustainability of economic growth and
the potential for higher inflation resulting from a strong job market and voracious consumer demand. Policy
makers could acknowledge concern Tuesday without raising rates by announcing they had shifted from a
neutral policy stance to a "tightening bias," which could foreshadow an increase.
"We think, on economic grounds, the Fed should raise rates," said Joe Lavorgna, senior economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, who didn't rule out an October rate move. "I don't find any very
compelling reasons to sit and wait. At minimum, that means the Fed is going to a tightening bias," he said.
Some analysts cited events in 1994 -- when the Fed engineered a series of rate rises -- as comparable.
"I think they're in the same kind of tightening mode as they were in 1994," said David Greenlaw, chief U.S.
fixedincome economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "The sequence was, when you
tightened, you went to a neutral bias. Then, at the meeting where you didn't tighten, you adopted a tightening
bias."
This year, the Fed began immediately announcing changes in its policy bias, which gives its another way of
influencing rates and expectations. Previously, such changes weren't disclosed for weeks.
But not everyone expects the Fed to exercise that option this time around.
Policy makers might feel announcing a move to a tightening bias would require them to push rates upward at
their next meeting, in November, said Bear, Stearns economist Melanie Hardy. Making no statement on the
policy bias might help the Fed keep its options open, she noted.

"Even though it is part of the Fed's pattern to switch its bias if it's not moving, we think the fact that it would
have to announce that may make it a little bit leery" of doing so, Ms. Hardy added.
Some analysts said the Fed could assume a tightening bias with no announcement. But the bond market
expects an announcement after every meeting, noted Ms. Hardy. With no announcement, people likely would
assume policymakers had kept neutral. That could spur a rebound in financial markets, which the Fed might
want to avoid, she said.

Corporate Bonds
CIT Group Inc., the New York consumer- and commercial-financial concern, sold yesterday's only
investment-grade corporate debt offering.
The offering, via Chase Securities Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., included $1 billion of five-year notes
yielding 1.33 percentage points over Treasurys and $500 million of three-year floating-rate notes yielding 0.35
percentage point over the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (Libor).
Separately, AT&T Corp. said it plans to redeem $350 million of 10.5% debentures due Oct. 30, 2007, at
105.25% of face value. It said it plans to pay accrued interest of $52.50 for every $1,000 principal amount for
the debt, issued by the company's TKR Corp. unit in 1992.
Agency Bonds
A $1 billion issue is expected today from the Federal Farm Credit Banks via joint lead managers Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter and J.P. Morgan Securities. The securities were expected to yield around 0.41 to 0.45
percentage point over comparable Treasurys.
The agency's latest deal comes on the heels of a $1.683 billion, two-part monthly bond sale Tuesday.
Traders said today's offering should do well, although shorter maturities in the market have come under
pressure in recent days.
In trading, Fannie Mae's 6.5%, five-year securities due August 2004 were quoted at a yield 0.61 percentage
point above comparable Treasurys late yesterday.

Euro's Gains Against Dollar and YenContinue on Hope of Regional Recovery

Euro's Gains Against Dollar and Yen Continue on Hope of Regional Recovery

The euro continued its solid climb against the dollar and yen, aided by its breach of a technical level and
optimism over economic recovery in Europe.
The dollar rose moderately against the yen as investors continued to liquidate long-yen positions built up
before this past weekend's Group of Seven industrial nations meeting in Washington.
But trading volume is tapering off as the end of the third quarter approaches, allowing small trades to cause
exaggerated price swings, analysts said.
In late-afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was changing hands at 107.01 yen, up from 106.24 yen late
Tuesday. The euro was trading at $1.0648, up from $1.0531. The euro also was at 113.87 yen, up from
111.87 yen. Sterling was at $1.6446, down from $1.6487. In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was
at 106.94 yen.
Yesterday, the euro rallied to its highest level in more than three weeks against the dollar and touched a 2 1/2
-week high against the yen at one point, even though no major euro-supportive economic data or remarks
emerged during the day.
U.S. investment funds provided the catalyst for the euro's strength as they bought euros and sold yen to
reverse recent bets that the European currency would weaken further, traders said.
The euro's climb accelerated after it rose above a pivotal technical level of $1.0630; it looks set to rise toward
the next crucial level around $1.0800, according to analysts. "Everyone's getting more bullish on the euro,"
said Avinash Pesaud, head of global research at State Street Bank in London.
The dollar's direction against the yen was less clear after the U.S. currency trimmed its earlier gains following
a failed attempt to break through resistance around 107.30 yen.
Although possible action by the G-7 nations to stop the yen's appreciation continued to pressure the
Japanese currency, attention was increasingly shifting to the quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment,
due out Monday in Japan. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
Trading in dollar/yen was further complicated by uncertainties over whether the Federal Reserve will keep
interest rates steady at its policy meeting Tuesday.
"Nobody's going to take a fundamentals-based position until they see the Tankan numbers and until they see
what the Fed's going to do," said Greg Anderson, financial economist at BankBoston.
Elsewhere, currencies of natural-resources-led economies lost their luster after gold prices retreated from
17-month highs reached Tuesday.
The Canadian dollar weakened after a retreat in gold prices set off mild profittaking on the currency. The U.S.
dollar was at C$1.4651, up from C$1.4615.
Similarly, the Australian dollar drifted lower after hopes the overnight rise in gold would push the currency
above the 66 U.S. cents level were dashed. The Australian currency was at 65.18 U.S. cents, down from
65.74 U.S. cents.
The October gold-futures contract fell $7.50 to $300.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after soaring as high as $321.00 intraday Tuesday.

The Indian rupee ended at a record low against the dollar as the central bank refrained from defending the
currency given a relatively slow pace of the decline and lack of volatility. The dollar was at 43.60 rupee, up
from 43.58 rupee.
Among other Asian currencies, the Singapore dollar and Indonesian rupiah rallied a bit.
Meanwhile, the Mexican peso got a lift from higher oil prices.

Stocks and Bonds Decline; S&P 500 Hits `Correction'

Jittery investors pushed down stocks another notch, leaving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the
broadest measure of big-stock performance, in what Wall Street calls a "correction."
Although bonds fell sharply for a second day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average pulled back for the
seventh time in eight trading sessions, the actual stock declines were mild. The dollar continued its rebound
against the yen.
But the S&P 500, which fell just 13.83 points, or 1.08%, to 1268.37, now is down 10.6% from its July 16
record close of 1418.78. Analysts often refer to a 10% drop as a correction. The Dow industrials fell 62.05, or
0.60%, to 10213.48, leaving them down 9.82% from their Aug. 25 record close of 11326.04.
While that kind of retreat is hardly a disaster, it is a sign of how nervous investors have become, nine years
into the bull market.
"The market is in a precarious position right now, especially with the Fed meeting coming up on Tuesday,"
said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard A. Rosenblatt, referring to the Federal Reserve policy meeting
on Oct. 5. "The market is going to have trouble rallying for a while, with any significant force."
Most analysts now anticipate the Fed will leave interest rates alone on Tuesday, but they fear it could raise
them later. Those fears were stoked by news that August durable-goods orders were stronger than expected.
In addition, the quarter ends today, and that sometimes produces unusual selling.
Rumors circulated again that big investment funds were selling stocks to cover losses in the gold market.
And talk is building about the risk of weak technology sales and technology-stock declines as 2000 nears.
"One of the fears that the stock market has is that it is over for the year and that the focus should be on
profit-taking or profit-protecting," said Bill Schneider, head of block trading at Warburg Dillon Read. "There is
kind of a cocoon mentality going into Y2K."
The Nasdaq Composite Index, heavy in technology names, fell 25.98 points, or 0.94%, to 2730.27. cqNo That
leaves it 5.43% short of its Sept. 10 record but up 24.52% for 1999. The industrials are up 11.24% since the
year began. The S&P 500, heavily exposed to weak bank and drug stocks, is up just 3.18%.
Small stocks bucked yesterday's trend and regained some ground. The beleaguered Russell 2000
small-stock index, down 0.1% for 1999, advanced 3.03 points, or 0.72%, to 422.15. Some Internet-related
stocks gained.
World-wide, stocks declined in dollar terms. Excluding U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell
0.45 point to 160.64.
In major market action:
Major stocks indexes declined. On the Big Board, where 850.9 million shares traded, 1,610 stocks advanced
and 1,465 declined.
Bonds declined. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 18/32, or $5.625 for a $1,000 bond, pushing the
yield up to 6.122%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at $1.0648 to the euro and 107.01 yen to the dollar,
weakening from $1.0531 and strengthening from 106.24 yen.

NEW YORK -- In the absence of distracting rumors about rising gold prices hurting leveraged positions held
by hedge funds, options traders were left to confront the tough market displayed on their computer screens.
Buying options to profit from the future direction of stocks took a back seat to worries the Federal Open
Market Committee would raise interest rates when it meets next week.
"This market is so overdone. The question is where is the bottom," said Scott Fullman, Swiss American
Securities' chief options strategist.
Jay Shartsis, R.F. Lafferty & Co.'s director of options trading, thinks the stock market has established a
bottom. He advised his clients to "go long" because total open interest in S&P 100 calls exceeds puts, which
he said has reliably marked a buy-signal for the past 12 years.
"Here's a scenario for the current market," Mr. Shartsis advised clients in a report. "We will now rally into next
week, when the Fed will not raise interest rates. That, of course, gives us a further sharp rally for a day and
we go short then. Go long for now."
The use of defensive index puts to hedge stock portfolios increased yesterday, but it wasn't enough to
persuade Mr. Fullman that investors have lost their complacency about the market.
He said the S&P 500 index found support at 1280 when the market closed Tuesday, only to open below that
level in the current session. "A lot is going to depend on where it closes. If it's below 1270, that's negative," he
said before the market closed.
The index declined 13.85 to 1268.35. The most actively traded S&P 500 put, the October 1275, gained 4 1/4
to 25 1/4 on volume of 4,567 contracts, compared with open interest of 20,558 contracts.
The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, gained
0.93, or 3.4%, to 27.90.

South Korean Index Plunges on Rate Concern; Taiwanese Issues Make First Gains Since Quake

South Korean stocks fell sharply again as concern spread that the central bank may be turning more
hawkish.
The benchmark Kospi index plunged 3.54% as interest-rate worries compounded concerns about the impact
of troubled Daewoo Group and a fall in the price of microchips. The decline brought the loss since a week
ago to more than 9%.
Other Asian markets were also mostly lower, though Taiwanese stocks managed to close with gains for the
first time since reopening after the earthquake. Major markets in Europe were mostly flat as investors
nervously monitored the U.S. market following Tuesday's erratic session. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock
Index fell 1.33, or 0.62%, to 213.12. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.45, or 0.28%, to 160.64.
In Seoul, the benchmark index has fallen nearly 15% since news of Daewoo Group's financial troubles broke
July 19. Yesterday, the market also began to worry that the central bank might disturb the low-interest-rate
environment that helped share prices rebound strongly from their lows of a year ago. Local news reports said
the Bank of Korea may shift monetary policy toward a tightening bias later this year, though bank officials
denied the report.
Even so, foreign investors were big sellers for the third straight session, and, unlike in previous weeks, the
Korean government hasn't tried to prod local institutions to buy.
"There are two things going on here," Brian Gendreau, an emerging-markets strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney, said. "The first is that investors have decided to take money off the table, believing that most of this
year's gains are probably behind us. The second is that the Daewoo situation shows that there is still a big
debt overhang that's yet to be worked out."
Many of Korea's investment-trust companies, which are similar to mutual funds, have exposure to Daewoo,
the financially troubled conglomerate that is Korea's second-largest business group. That exposure has led
many investors to seek redemptions from these trusts. The investment trusts in turn have been selling bonds
to raise cash to meet these redemptions, which has led to higher interest rates.
Further weighing on the Korean market was a fall in the global price of 64-megabit dynamic-access random
memory chips. Taiwan's massive earthquake damaged some chip factories, but more-recent reassessments
suggest the destruction is less than initially feared.Samsung Electronics fell 11,500 won to 206,00 won, while
Hyundai Electronics slid 4,450 won to 34,700 won.
A rise in the share prices of securities companies proved a lone bright spot. Analysts said they are optimistic
about halfyear earnings due early next month. LG Securities gained 200 won to 23,500 won, while Tong
Yang Securities rose 50 won to 9,600 won.
Beating them all was Good Morning Securities, which rose the daily limit of 15% to 7,990 won on market
speculation that the firm may be targeted for takeover by Chase Manhattan.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225 Index ended down 43.42 points at 17282.28. Traders said sentiment was cautious
and volume thin ahead of the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, or tankan, to be
released Monday, and the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-board meeting next week. The end of the first half of
Japan's fiscal year likely also slowed activity. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the day's most actively traded issue,
rose 28 yen to 520 yen amid the recent rise in gold prices. Mitsubishi Motors ended up seven yen at 540 yen
after the auto maker said it would continue negotiations with Volvo about production of next-generation
models at their joint venture in the Netherlands.

In TAIPEI, the Weighted Price Index finished up 37.60 points or 0.50% at 7615.45. Although traders said the
government ordered some buying of electronics shares, investor interest was already returning on its own.
United Microelectronics rose 1.50 new Taiwan dollars to 75 new Taiwan dollars. The island's second-biggest
chip maker said it expects insurance payments to offset much of the losses it incurred as a result of last
week's quake. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ended up 2.50 new Taiwan dollars at 132.50 new
Taiwan dollars after it said Tuesday that 90% of its equipment has been released for production.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index closed up 13.40 points, or 0.22%, at 6020.60. Technology issues enjoyed
gains after the Nasdaq Stock Market opened higher. Software company Sage Group extended Tuesday's
3.9% advance and rose 55 pence, or 2%, to 2,715 pence, while Misys added 19.5 pence, or 3.5%, to close at
584.5 pence. Computer-services firm Sema Group rose 27 pence, or 3.7%, to 760.5 pence. Elsewhere, BP
Amoco rose 27 pence to 1,092 pence on news that the Competition Directorate of the European Commission
gave its approval to BP's merger with Atlantic Richfield.
In FRANKFURT, the Xetra DAX ended down 0.32%, or 16.52 points, at 5135.62. Siemens fell 1% to 78.50
euros following a Tuesday announcement that it was selling its electro-mechanical components unit to Tyco
International Ltd. for $1.1 billion, as part of its group restructuring effort to trim holdings. Deutsche Bank
gained on reports it was in talks with France's Societe Generale about a partnership in investment. Deutsche
Bank closed 0.7% higher at 62.55 euros.
In PARIS, the CAC 40 fell 8.84 points, or 0.19%, to 4535.08. Eurotunnel gained 3.7% to 1.140 euros after the
"chunnel" operator said its has bought back a package of its debt securities, at a substantial discount to face
value, which it will finance with a rights issue.

LONDON -- Could the euro be the next star of the global currency market?
Recently, talk was of the euro falling to parity with the dollar. Now, the odds of that are "very, very minimal,"
says Tony Norfield, global head of foreign-exchange research at ABN Amro Bank in London. Although the
euro is down 10% so far this year, Europe's nine-month-old currency is well above the $1.0108 low set July
13.
James O'Neill, chief currency economist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in London, predicts the euro will be more
than 6% higher at $1.12 by Christmas and a whopping 16% higher at $1.22 in a year.
He points to signs of renewed economic growth in the 11-nation euro zone, a narrowing of the difference in
yields on U.S. and German government bonds and other euro-boosting data. There also is the argument that
it is the least ugly of the world's three major currencies.
"A lot of people don't like the dollar because of the ballooning American trade deficit, but they don't want to
buy the yen," he says. He also contends the euro is cheap, roughly 18% undervalued on Goldman's
proprietary valuation models.
In late-afternoon trading in New York, the euro was at $1.0531, up from $1.0464 late Monday. The dollar was
also trading at 106.24 yen, compared with 105.73 yen, the day before. Sterling was changing hands at
$1.6487, up from $1.6451.
The dollar moved higher against the yen as market players sided with safety, still grappling with the
uncertainties of what the Group of Seven planned to do to stop the yen's appreciation. But the dollar fell
against European and commoditylinked currencies in a move many analysts say was fueled by the unwinding
of so-called gold-carry trades as the price of the precious metal soared.
The gold trade involved borrowing in a product at a low interest rate to fund a higher yielding investment,
which analysts speculated may have been U.S. stocks. Market players scrambled to brace themselves
against what was feared would be a concurrent liquidation, but of what they were uncertain. With gold
skyrocketing to an intraday high of $329.00 a troy ounce, many pointed to the sell-off in U.S. stocks.
Meanwhile, the euro was buoyed by a weak opening on Wall Street and a survey of French business leaders
published by Insee, the French national statistics institute, which painted a much-brighter-than-expected
picture of the French economy.
Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities Inc. in New York, also noted that "the
selling of eurodenominated assets by Japanese institutional investors is running its course as the end of the
quarter approaches, and that the upward pressure on the yen has been curbed in the short-run by Japanese
official comments that they may be prepared to ease monetary policy further."
Maligned, weak and deeply disappointing to U.S. and Japanese investors, the euro has drastically
underperformed expectations. Euro-land government officials and economists at big international banks told
investors late last year to expect a strong currency -- one backed by vibrant euro-zone growth, massive
purchases by Asian central banks, a European Central Bank free of political pressure and strong European
stock markets.
Instead, Euroland's economy weakened; central banks in Asia didn't swap dollars for euros; the ECB became
the whipping boy of Germany's former finance minister; and, except for France, Euroland's major stock
markets haven't been anything to write home about.

Recently, the euro has been depressed by Japanese investors hedging their eurodenominated investments
to stem further losses, as the currency weakened.
"But over the last week, things have changed: We've seen yet more economic data and surveys from the
euro area indicating a robust economic pickup in the euro countries," Mr. Norfield says. He sees the euro the
rising to $1.10 by year end and $1.14 in 12 months.
Even the lackluster performances of the German, Italian, Dutch and Spanish stock markets could have their
appeal, if only because they aren't overpriced in comparison to the U.S., Mr. Norfield says. Last but not least
stands the huge -- and expanding -- U.S. trade deficit. "In an environment of stronger global growth and
improving investment opportunities outside of the U.S., it will weigh on the dollar," Ms. Parker of Chase
Securities says.

Bonds End Lower Amid Talk of Investors Selling To Offset Losses Resulting From Gold-Price Rise

NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended sharply lower for a second day amid talk that some investors unloaded large
amounts of U.S. bonds to make up for losses partly resulting from soaring gold prices.
In fear- and speculation-driven trading, Treasurys also were pressured by selling related to a $5.25 billion
issue by Fannie Mae, worries that the Federal Reserve next week may adopt a bias toward tightening
interest rates and renewed fears that liquidity may dry up around the turn of the century.
Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 30/32 point, or $9.375 for a bond with
$1,000 face value, at 100 16/32. Its yield rose to 6.081% from 6.009% late Monday, as bond yields move
inversely to prices.
The main catalyst of the sell-off was talk that hedge funds sold bonds -- from less actively traded Treasurys to
agency securities and other debt. Traders said they did so to offset large losses suffered from short sales of
gold futures and so-called yen carry trade transactions.
Going short involves selling in anticipation that a market will decline, with the aim of making offsetting
purchases at lower price levels and realizing a profit on the differential.
Yen carry trade, meanwhile, involves borrowing in yen-denominated markets -- where interest rates are
dramatically lower than in many other markets -- and investing that money in higher-yielding assets, such as
U.S. Treasurys. Hedge funds have been active in recent years in such transactions.
Late in the session, Treasurys losses grew because of selling by Wall Street dealers who simultaneously
were buying various securities from hedge funds. Those dealers were trying to protect themselves against
further declines in the market.
A focus through the day was the continued surge in gold prices. The October gold futures contract closed at
$310 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest since April 1998.
"Gold has been ignored for such a long time because it's been such a poor inflation indicator. But it
suddenly caught people's attention," said Ken Fan, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets in New York.
Analysts said the Treasurys market also was affected by concerns about rising international interest rates.
Yesterday, the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, rose more than expected. The upward
move in Libor -- the bank dealing rate for dollars on deposit in London -- suggests that investors want a larger
risk premium for the turn of the century, said Robin Grieves, government-bond strategist at HSBC Securities
Inc., New York.
"People had already thought the Fed's announcement about providing plenty of liquidity {to offset any
year-2000 liquidity crisis} took some of the risk premium out of the market, but now that the Libor is coming in
higher, people are concerned," he said.
The downward spiral in Treasurys prices came despite further weakness in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which at one point traded more than 200 points lower than Monday's close, but ended down 27.86
points at 10275.53. Falling equities prices typically boost the allure of government debt.
Bond investors are worried that upcoming economic indicators may show a resurgence of inflation,
prompting the Fed to raise rates for the third time this year. Fed policy makers are scheduled to meet again
Oct. 5, and some people in the market believe the Fed will likely take a step closer to an actual tightening of
rates by adopting a tightening bias, or policy stance, traders said.

"Bearish tone is spreading fast across the market," said Yasunori Sugi, Treasurys trader at Fuji Bank Ltd. in
New York. "We can't expect too much of good news in terms of fundamentals."
New issues didn't help Treasurys either, as Fannie Mae sold $5.25 billion in a reopening of outstanding
five-year and 30-year benchmark debt issues.
"They drew enough demand, but {yield} spreads were at the higher end of expectations," Mr. Sugi said,
referring to the extra yields investors demand to buy bonds perceived to be riskier than government debt.
Corporate Bonds
Inter-American Development Bank priced a $1 billion offering of three-year notes at a yield margin of 0.58
percentage point over comparable Treasurys via Deutsche Bank and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
Triple-A-rated IADB provides economic and social assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean.
Also, New York-based integrated oil and gas company Amerada Hess Corp. made its debut in the public debt
market with a $1 billion two-part offering of 10- and 30-year notes via J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.
The offering was doubled in size from the $500 million originally expected. Amerada priced $300 million in
10-year notes at a yield margin of 1.58 percentage points over Treasurys and $700 million in 30-year
securities at a yield margin of 1.78 percentage points over Treasurys.
Investors said they were drawn not only to the attractive pricing levels of the offering but also to the positive
fundamentals in the oil industry.
Agency Bonds
Yield margins between agency securities and those of U.S. Treasurys grew wider by about 0.02 percentage
point in the resale market yesterday as government bonds and the stock market slid.
Fannie Mae was able to sell out $5.25 billion of add-ons to two of its issues already outstanding, although
each eased slightly in late-day trading.
The agency priced $3.5 billion of its five-year, 6.5% benchmark notes at a 0.585 percentage-point margin
over comparable Treasurys and $1.75 billion of its 30-year, 6.25% benchmark bonds at a spread of 0.81
percentage point over Treasurys.
Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp. priced $1.325 billion of three-month and $358 million of six-month
consolidated systemwide bonds. Both came with coupons of 5.56%.
Traders also were speculating about the next jumbo offering from Freddie Mac, which they said could be in
the short to intermediate part of the yield curve.

Stocks Drop, Then Regain Ground

Stocks Drop, Then Regain Ground

In one of the year's sharper round trips, stocks plummeted in the morning, then soared back in the afternoon,
leaving investors catching their breath but stock prices little changed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 222.26 points early in the afternoon, was just 81.13 points above
10000 at its low. But it finished down just 27.86, or 0.27%, at 10275.53.
Other stock indexes staged similar recoveries. The dollar continued to regain ground against the yen. Gold
soared for a second day on news European central banks will sharply limit their selling. But bonds, whose
main trading session ends an hour ahead of that for stocks, suffered a sharper loss.
"I'm feeling like I was in a spin-dry cycle or on a roller coaster or something," said Andy Brooks, head of stock
trading at Baltimore mutual-fund group T. Rowe Price. "It was a wild, wild day."
One reason for the craziness, traders said, was that there wasn't any clear news event to which to look. They
blamed the morning selling on a change in the composition of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, shock
at the soaring price of gold, rumors that some investment partnerships were madly selling stocks to cover
losing bets against gold, end-of-month portfolio changes, anxiety over interest rates and worries about
possible market troubles as the year 2000 approaches. Also, Prudential Securities technical analyst Ralph
Acampora began warning of a possible market drop.
For most of the day, both the industrials and the S&P 500 were in what Wall Street calls a correction, or a
decline of 10% from their closing highs; they wound up above that level. Investors, in some cases using
sophisticated computer-driven programs, jumped in to buy up beaten-down stocks during the afternoon.
Although the major indexes closed down, several stock groups, including semiconductor stocks, Internet
stocks, technology stocks in general and banks, finished the day higher.
Buyers seemed to decide stocks looked cheap once the major indexes hit correction territory. Michael Clark,
head of U.S. stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said a rebound in S&P futures prices at a critical
technical level helped reassure people that the worst was over.
"The fact that we held gave people renewed confidence that we might hold into the end of the month and
possibly into early October," he said, although he added that he would expect markets to remain volatile.
Some traders decided the market has bottomed for now.
But "as we get closer to the end of the year," said Tim Morris, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, "we
are looking at people taking money off the table. They are locking in profits. We don't hear too many people
talking about the year 2000, but their actions may show that that's what they are thinking."
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which yesterday fell 5.50 points, or 0.20%, to 2756.25, is down 4.53% from its
Sept. 10 record close of 2887.06, well above "correction" territory. It is up 25.70% for 1999. But the S&P 500,
which fell 1.11, or 0.09%, to 1282.20, is 9.63% off its July 16 record close of 1418.78, just above a correction,
and a mere 4.31% ahead for the year. The Dow industrials, down for six of the past seven days, are 9.28%
below the Aug. 25 record close of 11326.04, and up 11.92% since the beginning of the year.
World-wide, stocks advanced in dollar terms. Excluding U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose
0.32 point to 161.09.
In major market action:

--- Page 166 ---

Stocks retreated. On the Big Board, where 876.9 million shares traded, 1,130 stocks advanced and 1,899
declined.
Bonds declined. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 30/32 point, or $9.375 for a $1,000 bond, pushing
the yield up to 6.081%.
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at $1.0531 to the euro and 106.24 yen to the dollar,
weakening from $1.0464 and strengthening from 105.73 yen.

NEW YORK -- The bounce-back rally that lifted the stock market all but ignored the options market.
Volatility, an important part of options prices, fell sharply, but there were few instances of traders using
options to predict the direction of underlying stocks, a strategist at an options-trading firm said.
For example, Motorola Inc. stock gained 4.4% on heavy volume after product announcements, but trading in
its call options wasn't substantial.
The often-ignored gold sector, however, was the exception on a rather listless day when news, not
momentum, got traders off the sidelines.
Gold and mining stocks rallied on news that 15 central banks would curtail their gold sales over the next five
years.
One firm played the news by constructing a "synthetic long" position in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's
gold and silver index. It bought October 85 calls with proceeds from selling October 70 puts. With the index
up 15.06 at 86.52, the October 85 call gained 4 5/16 to 4 5/8 on volume of 2,539 contracts, compared with
open interest of 25. The October 70 put fell 2 1/16 to 7/16 on volume of 1,033 contracts. Open interest was
604 contracts.
The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index fell 2.27, or
7.7%, to 27.27. The decline in volatility occurred after comments by Japan's central bank that it might
combat the yen's sharp rise against the dollar by raising the money supply.
The CBOE's equity put/call ratio was 0.45. The ratio is viewed as an indicator of contrarian sentiment. Using
this contrarian criteria, the index has been considered a bullish-sentiment indicator if it is around 0.75 to 1,
neutral from 0.40 to 0.75 and bearish if it is below 0.40. The CBOE's index put/call ratio was 1.03. This ratio is
also interpreted as a contrarian-sentiment indicator. The index is considered bullish if the ratio is 1.5 or
higher; neutral from 0.75 to 1.5 and bearish if it is below 0.75.

Gold Soars on Decision by Central Banks

It has been a long time since the phrase "good as gold" has had a ring of truth. But yesterday came close.
The metal's value skyrocketed $14 an ounce to $281.80, hitting a five-month high on news that 15 European
central banks won't unload extra gold onto the market for the next five years.
Analysts said the unexpected move virtually erased the biggest specter that has been scaring investors away
from gold for more than a year -- a seemingly endless string of rumors or announcements that government
gold sales could flood the market.
But now, after hitting several new 20-year lows over the summer, gold has made a sharp turnaround. In the
past two weeks including yesterday, the metal has risen by $24.90, or almost 10%. Gold still is below the
$300 level it traded at almost a year ago, but analysts and traders said yesterday that the metal's price could
now hit that level by year end as investors move away from their bearish futures bets.
"This is a serious change in sentiment; we haven't had anything like this in a long time," said metals analyst
Matthew Ford, of the fund U.S. Global Investors Inc., San Antonio, Texas. "This has the hallmark of being a . .
. sustainable run, because you've effectively discounted much of what the negative speculation was."
The announcement by government banks came at a time when gold prices had become particularly
politicized, analysts and traders said.
Leading the charge in support of higher prices was the World Gold Council trade group, which rallied African
officials to oppose official sales, sponsored aggressive advertising campaigns and commissioned polls
showing citizens' support for their governments' holding more of the metal.
Yesterday, council officials said the European banks' announcement could fundamentally change their
strategy in the coming months.
"In light of what's occurred in the last nine months, we've been put a little on the defensive," said Michael
Barlerin, the World Gold Council's chief executive for Western markets. "I don't sense that some of the
programs that we've been running will need to have the same tone now. For example . . . I don't think it's
going to be necessary to continue the significant adversarial role we've had to the Bank of England
decisions."
In the announcement late Sunday, the European Central Bank and 14 individual nations said they wouldn't
sell or lease any more of their own gold holdings, beyond previously scheduled transactions such as the
Bank of England's plan to gradually sell 400 tons of the metal.
Yesterday's price rally on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange built upon a rally that
began last week when the second installment of the Bank of England's auction showed increasingly bullish
producer sentiment toward the metal.
However, such government gold sales have generally been almost poisonous to gold's value. Even after
yesterday's rally, the metal still hasn't returned to its price level before the May announcement of the British
sale. But analysts said the weekend's European announcement was unprecedented both as an affirmation of
official bullishness toward gold and as a sign of consensus among a usually fractious group of national
banks.
"Gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves," the central banks said in an
announcement presented by European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg. "The current situation is

--- Page 169 ---
Page 169 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
characterized by uncertainty and that uncertainty by itself led to a lot of volatility and a downward trend in the
gold price."
The European announcement came at a time when bank officials were gathered in Washington for the
International Monetary Fund's annual meeting. The IMF itself confirmed over the weekend that it had nixed
plans to sell 10 million ounces of its own 103 million ounce gold reserve on the open market to raise money
to provide debt relief for poor countries.
Instead, faced with industry and congressional opposition, the U.S. Treasury and the IMF engineered a
complex new plan in which the IMF will boost the book value of 14 million ounces of gold, then use those
resources to help developing countries cut their debts to the IMF.
Analysts said the series of announcements generally reflected the realization by governments and producers
that gold had bottomed out, perhaps artificially in an overzealous response to speculation about official sales.
Amid the general euphoria yesterday, however, some analysts were cautious to warn that the latest reversal,
spurred largely by a wave of new producer and fund buying, will eventually have to rely on more substantial
economic developments to sustain itself.
In particular, the yen will have to remain strong against the dollar because Japan is such a large consumer of
gold, said George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities in New York.
"As far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out on this rally," he said. "This sort of event focuses attention on gold
a lot more than a short-term disaster, war or assassination. Gold is, after all, an economic haven. But its
value is ultimately more tied to economic events than political ones."
The rise in gold prices buoyed several gold-mining stocks yesterday, most notably Newmont Mining Corp.,
which rose $4.875 to $27.8125, and Anglogold Ltd., which rose $5.4375 to $34.375 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
But despite yesterday's price spike, Newmont, based in Denver, for now plans to hold onto a bearish options
hedge it recently opened on 2.35 million ounces of gold through 2009, said Chief Financial Officer Bruce D.
Hansen.
"Right now we're definitely trying to stand back for the market and digest what this means in the short term,"
he said. "It's still a tough market to do anything from a producer standpoint."
Analysts yesterday expected most mining companies to remain similarly cautious and said they were unlikely
to launch new mines, as the latest gains may evaporate by the time the five-year to seven-year start-up time
for new mining projects has passed.
One effect the price boost may have, however, is higher jewelry prices, said estate jeweler Tobina Kahn,
whose familyowned firm received 10 calls at its offices in Chicago and Palm Beach, Fla., yesterday from
customers wanting to sell gold jewelry.
Usually, Ms. Kahn says she warns consumers that there's less correlation than they might expect between
gold commodity prices and the value of finished gold items. Yesterday was a different story, though.
"The average gold investment is going to be worth perhaps three times more," she said, referring to the kind
of family heirlooms her firm usually buys. "This affects the price of anybody who has any type of gold jewelry
that has any significant weight of gold to it. We're talking about the kinds of everyday items that people have
sitting in a collection somewhere."
In addition to the European Central Bank, the following individual countries agreed not to sell or lease
additional gold over the next five years: Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.
In other commodities trading yesterday:
PLATINUM: Futures prices gained on the New York Mercantile Exchange, bolstered by the rally in gold,
traders said. The January contract surged $12.20 to $383.10 an ounce. "Platinum continues to be a very
strong market," said Dave Meger, senior metals analyst with Alaron in Chicago. "Well before the gold move,
platinum moved up on the back of yen strength and the turnaround in the Asian economy."
HOGS: Futures prices advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reaching the maximum exchange-set
limit, buoyed by a strong hog and pig report from the Agriculture Department, traders said. The October
contract was up two cents to $4.85 a pound.

Germany's KirchPayTV Cancels Junk-Bond Sale As Investors Continue to Stay Away From Market

In the latest sign of the widespread pain in the junk-bond market, Germany's KirchPayTV GmBH was forced
to cancel a $1.1 billion bond offering, the biggest pulled junk deal on record, as investors continue to shun
such bonds.
Kirch, the big German pay-TV company, will instead turn to its investment banker on the deal, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, for a senior loan valued at $1.5 billion marks, or roughly $900 million.
"The bond was well received, but the market conditions weren't acceptable; the volumes were below what we
had expected," Kirch-Gruppe spokesman Johannes Schmitz said.
Investors showed little interest in the Kirch deal despite yields of about 15% for the senior discount notes. In
recent months, bond investors have been increasingly averse to high-yield bonds, otherwise known as junk
bonds, amid fears of rising interest rates and nervousness about whether investors will bail out of bonds
ahead of 2000.
High-yield mutual funds have experienced net selling in seven out of the past eight weeks, and AMG Data
Services last week reported as much as $259 million of cash flowed out of junk-bond mutual funds in the
most recent week. In fact, the average high-yield mutual fund has gains of less than 2% this year, and
investment banking firms say their profits in the area are falling short of expectations.
Amid the gloomy tone in the market, few bond buyers had ample cash, or a hearty enough stomach, to buy
bonds from Kirch rated triple-C, a low junk-bond rating, by Standard & Poor's.
"Cash positions in the market are very low, and more transactions are being pulled," said William Kourakos, a
managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the lead manager of the deal.
As many as 17 junk-bond deals have been pulled from the market, amid tepid investor interest.
On top of that, the German pay TV company wouldn't be cash-flow positive for two to three years or so, said
Dean Kartsonas, high-yield telecommunications analyst at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh.
"It's a very difficult market with persistent mutual fund outflows making for a lackluster year," said Les Levi,
director of media and telecommunications research at Chase Securities.
Treasury Bonds
Treasurys sank as stocks rebounded, lifting the benchmark 30-year bond's yield back over the key 6% mark.
Late yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down 20/32 point, or $6.25 for a bond with $1,000
face value, at 101 15/32. Its yield rose to 6.009% from 5.964% late Friday, as bond yields move inversely to
prices.
Last week's sharp losses in stocks had given bonds a boost, raising expectations that investors might shift
funds into the haven of U.S. government securities. As a result, attention yesterday focused "almost
exclusively on equity-driven trades," said Joe Lavorgna, government bond analyst at Deutsche Bank in New
York.
But bonds lost favor as stocks rallied, even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended well below
session highs, up 24.06 points at 10303.39.

However, in the absence of major economic news, Treasurys activity was relatively light. The "very thin
trading volume exacerbated the downward move" of Treasurys, said Gregg Cohen, a trader at CIBC World
Markets in New York.
Treasurys drew little support from a recovery in the dollar after a statement by finance officials from major
industrialized countries meeting this weekend in Washington. The statement said they "shared Japan's
concern about the potential impact of the yen's appreciation for the Japanese economy and the world
economy."
Late yesterday afternoon, the dollar was quoted at 105.7300 yen, up from 104.2350 yen late Friday.
Traders said a surge in gold prices contributed to the negative tone in Treasurys. Gold rose after 15
European central banks over the weekend pledged not to enter the market to sell gold, except for sales that
have been decided. Late yesterday in New York, gold was trading at about $281.80 an ounce, up $14 from
Friday.
Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $14 billion of 13- and 26-week bills at
its regular weekly auction. Here are details:

Fannie Mae further increased the amount it will sell in reopening outstanding five- and 30-year benchmark
issues, citing greater-than-expected demand, according to dealers involved in the transaction.
The agency's offering of 6.5% notes due August 2004 is now $3.5 billion, increased from $3 billion, while the
offering of 6.25% securities due May 2029 was upsized to $1.75 billion from $1.5 billion.
Traders said they expect at least 20% of the issues to land in overseas portfolios. Goldman Sachs, J.P.
Morgan Securities and Lehman Brothers are joint lead managers of the reopenings, for which terms will be
set today.
Also today, Federal Farm Credit Banks will sell $1.583 billion of consolidated systemwide bonds. Price talk on
the coupon was 5.56% to 6% for both its $1.225 billion of three-month and $358 million of six-month
securities, according to FFCB.

U.K. Banks Lead a Powerful Rally in London, But South Korean, Other Asian Markets Slump

A powerful rally in shares of United Kingdom banks, which investors believe are on the brink of a
consolidation wave, sent London's stock market soaring by 2.4%.
The speculation, which began on Friday following Bank of Scotland's unsolicited GBP 20.85 billion ($34.24
billion) offer for National Westminster Bank, was stoked over the weekend by reports that Royal Bank of
Scotland is preparing a counterbid of GBP 25 billion. The latest talk helped push up the U.K. retail-bank
sector 5.6% yesterday.
The rally in the U.K. and a strong opening on Wall Street set a positive tone for most European stocks, which
closed with strong gains. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies jumped by 1.4%. The
optimism didn't extend to Asia, however, where most markets slumped. South Korean share prices were hit
hardest, falling by 4%, while Taiwan stocks tumbled by 2.7% during the first day of trading since the
earthquake closed the market last week.
Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose by 1.28, or 0.60%, to 214.36. Excluding the U.S., the index
rose by 1.31, or 0.82%, to 160.77.
For the second consecutive session, bank stocks dominated U.K. trading. Traders said volume was relatively
thin and largely confined to banks and financial-services shares, which were gobbled up by long-term
investors and hedge funds alike. The FTSE closed up 141 points to 6078.6, its best performance since Sept.
3.
Leading the way, shares of takeover target NatWest surged by 9% to 14.76 following a 29% gain on Friday.
Bank of Scotland shares were up by 6% to 795.5 pence, while shares of Royal Bank of Scotland soared by
9% to 13.91.
The buying spilled over into other financial stocks, as investors looked to grab potential merger candidates.
Lloyds TSB, for instance, gained 8.1% to 786.5 pence. "If you look at other European markets, you'll see that
consolidation in [the banking sector] really helped stock prices," noted Robert Law, a banking analyst for
Lehman Brothers in London.
He added that the case to be made for an extended rally in U.K. bank stocks is better than for Continental
bank shares, because British banks offer a return on equity of about 20% and a price-to-earnings ratio of
about 15. That compares with the European bank average of a 20 P/E ratio with a return on equity of 15%.
But despite the seemingly inevitable merger activity, not everyone agrees that U.K. banks represent the best
value.
"Consolidation is coming in the middle of an intensely competitive environment, so we're cautious on the
sector," said Mike Young, European equity strategist for Goldman Sachs in London. Compared with German,
French and Austrian banks, he said, "U.K. valuations look high."
While some investors suggest that a Continental bank like France's Societe Generale or the Dutch ING
Group could enter the U.K. bank bidding war, Marc Halperin of Federated Investors in New York says
significant cross-border merger activity in the banking sector remains a few years away.
He suggests buying Standard Chartered Bank, which pulls in more than half its revenue from Asia. "That's a
way to capture both Asia's recovery and the bank merger activity in the U.K.," Mr. Halperin said.
Banks, however, weren't alone in U.K. merger speculation. Shares of large drinks company Allied Domecq
gained 23 pence to 348.25 pence after rumors of a bid from French rival Pernod-Ricard. U.K. utility Severn

Trent rose by 50.5 pence to 937 pence following news reports over the weekend that Germany's RWE is
preparing a takeover bid.
But the biggest gainer in the U.K. was Anglo American, a mining and financial conglomerate, that soared by
9.4% to 3,531 pence. The shares were boosted by a pledge from 15 European central bankers to limit sales
of gold from their reserves to 2,000 tons over the next five years.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225 Index closed down 50.67 points at 16821.06, while investors continued to hope
that the Bank of Japan will take action to weaken the yen. Steel issues rose after the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
newspaper reported Monday morning that Japan's crude-steel output in fiscal 1999 is paced to reach 95
million tons, surpassing prior industry estimates of 93 million. Industry leader Nippon Steel rose by seven yen
to 265 yen, while NKK finished four yen higher at 99 yen. Consumer-finance company Takefuji slipped by
2,030 yen to 16,470 yen on concern about new competition. Sakura Bank said Friday it will form a retail-loan
joint venture with Nippon Life Insurance and two other Japanese companies.
In SEOUL, the Kospi nose-dived by 37.78 to 903.79, with analysts citing last week's rout on Wall Street and
rising global oil prices that could lead to inflation. Foreigners sold shares valued at a net 130.3 billion won
($107.5 million), while local institutions sold a net 36.4 billion won. Local retail investors bought a net 264.1
billion won of shares. Samsung Electronics was down by 15,500 won to 220,000 won, and Pohang Iron &
Steel shares dropped by 8,000 won to 162,000 won.
In TAIPEI, the Weighted Index celebrated its first day of trading since last Tuesday's earthquake with a
widespread sell-off. The index declined 212.21, or 2.7%, to 7759.93 in the lightest trading volume since
February 1996. In an effort to stem losses, the Ministry of Finance over the weekend lowered the daily limit
on price declines to 3.5% from the usual 7%, which means the losses could continue for a few more days,
some analysts said. As technology stocks uniformly fell, some sectors that are expected to be part of the
earthquake recovery flourished. Steel and cement stocks were up by 6.1% and 6.8% respectively.
In FRANKFURT, the Xetra DAX ended up 1%, or 53.11 points, at 5239.64. Utilities Veba and Viag
announced their merger plans early yesterday and said the deal should be completed by the summer of
2000. Viag shareholders are to receive one Veba share for every 2.8 Viag shares held. Shares of Veba
ended higher by 3.2% at 55.20 euros. Viag shares ended lower by 3.8% at 19.48 euros.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 Index rose by 55.73 points, or 1.2%, to 4596.60. Shares in spirits group Pernod-Ricard
were up on the renewed speculation it is about to launch a takeover bid for Allied Domecq. PernodRicard
rose by 5.1% to 66.30 euros. Spokesmen for both companies declined to comment.
In LATIN AMERICA, Argentina's Merval Index rallied nearly 4% to close up 19.94 to 526.48, while Mexico's
IPC Index gained 1.5% to 5055.76. But Brazil's Bovespa Index managed to gain just 0.1% to 11542.

Dollar, Euro Post Gains Against Yen;G-7 Summit Fuels Talk of Intervention

Dollar, Euro Post Gains Against Yen; G-7 Summit Fuels Talk of Intervention

The dollar and euro climbed against the yen, as traders unraveled some of the yen's strong gains on signs
that Japanese officials emerged from Group of Seven talks ready to boost market liquidity.
But trading was erratic and tentative, and market opinion was mixed on whether the Bank of Japan is actually
changing its yen policy. Some traders were disappointed the Japanese central bank didn't move to loosen
credit on the first trading day after the meeting of the world's largest economies -- the U.S., Canada, Britain,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
In late-afternoon trading in New York, the dollar was at 105.73 yen, up from 104.24 yen late Friday. The euro
was at $1.0464, up from $1.0447; sterling was changing hands at $1.6451, up from $1.6422.
The market is eager to see what the central bank does to ensure the dollar continues to climb against the
yen.
"It's only sustainable if they come through with a monetary easing, which is what we're anticipating," said
Andrew Busch, director of foreign exchange at the Bank of Montreal in Chicago. "On a technical basis, this is
random noise until we get up to 108.00 yen."
The G-7 said Saturday it shares Japan's concern about yen strength and that the group will "continue to
monitor developments in exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate."
Given the dollar's rise yesterday, the market "assumes from the G-7 statement that the Bank of Japan has
acquiesced to the United States and decided to engage in some kind of stimulus to promote domestic
demand," Mr. Busch said.
Bank of Japan Governor Masuru Hayami said the bank "is prepared to use the flexibility it has in the context
of the zero-interest-rate policy where ample liquidity is provided to respond appropriately and timely to
developments in the economy as well as in the financial markets, including the foreign-exchange market."
Some analysts detected a significant change from the central bank's statement a week ago, when the bank
said policy makers wouldn't target currency rates.
"I don't think the policy makers make such a radical shift without intending to follow it up if the market needs
it," said Ram Bhagavatula, chief economist at NatWest Global Financial Markets in New York, anticipating the
dollar will rise toward 110.00 yen and 115.00 yen.
But others aren't so sure.
"I don't know what everyone is getting excited about," said Robert Sinche, currency strategist at Citibank in
New York, noting that the central bank has merely said it will use "flexibility." Mr. Sinche anticipates the
dollar/yen rate will stabilize above 105.00 yen.
Sterling rose to an eight-month high against the dollar and its highest level ever against the euro on
enthusiasm for British assets before retreating a bit.
"There are indications that the U.K. is joining the ranks of the strong-growth club," Mr. Sinche said.
Surging gold prices gave a lift to commodity-based currencies, though the Australian dollar's gains were
limited by heavy positioning. The U.S. dollar was at A$1.5328, down from A$1.5360.

The South African rand and Canadian dollar managed more sizable gains, as gold lept nearly $14 a troy
ounce on surprise news that 15 European central banks pledged Sunday to limit their gold sales to about 400
metric tons a year during the next five years. The dollar was at 6.0010 South African rand, down from 6.0412
rand. The U.S. currency was at C$1.4690, down from C$1.4720.
Colombia's peso weakened a bit in surprisingly calm dealings during its first day of trading under a new free
float. The U.S. dollar was at 2008.50 pesos, up from 1994.35 pesos. Colombia's central bank announced
Saturday it would abandon the peso's five-year-old trading band, after a week in which the bank spent $40
million to defend the band against speculative attack.

Gold Rally Continues on Weak Stocks, Dollar

Gold Rally Continues on Weak Stocks, Dollar

NEW YORK -- Gold gained Friday, marking four consecutive days of sharp gains since the United Kingdom's
second auction of 25 metric tons from its reserves.
While the auction helped spark the rally because it showed better-than-expected demand, it was primarily a
hurdle that the market needed to get over to allow other bullish factors to lead the price higher, traders and
analysts said.
The active December future on the Comex Division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $2.50 to
$269.80 a troy ounce. Since Tuesday's auction, the contract has gained $14.
"The auction was the opportunity, but not the cause," said Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM
Group, a New York-based research and consulting firm.
"A number of people turned bullish in August after Goldman [Sachs] took delivery," said Mr. Christian.
Goldman Sachs took delivery of a large amount of physical Comex gold in August. Traders had thought
Goldman was short in the market -- betting prices would fall -- but its taking delivery represented a large long
position, or a bet prices would rise, they said.
"That was taken as a buy sign by a lot of people, but they held back because they were waiting for the
auction," said Mr. Christian. "They were a little bit concerned about that coming up."
Some market participants feared the same result as the U.K.'s first auction of 25 tons in July, after which the
price of gold tumbled to fresh 20-year lows.
Tuesday's auction was taken more seriously by bidders, and drew a higher amount of bids and a relatively
high average price, analysts said.
The latest sale was "much better than people expected," said George Gero, first vice president with
Prudential Securities in New York. That allowed participants to focus on other bullish factors, such as the
steady decline in the U.S. dollar and weakness in U.S. equities, traders and analysts said.
A weaker dollar increases the risk of inflation by raising the cost of imports, which adds to gold's appeal as a
solid investment. Falling equity prices also add to the relative allure of gold in a portfolio.
Renewed expectations that the International Monetary Fund won't sell gold from its reserves on to the market
helped fuel gold's gains, market observers said.
Rather than selling 10 million ounces of its gold reserves to finance debt relief for heavily indebted poor
countries, the IMF now proposes to raise revenue by revaluing the value of its reserves.
Separately, yesterday 15 European central banks led by the European Central Bank pledged that they
wouldn't enter the market as a seller of gold, with the exception of sales that have previously been arranged.
In other commodity markets:
LUMBER: Futures fell sharply at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to cashmarket weakness, brokers
and analysts said. The November contract fell its $10 limit to $311.30 a thousand board feet. Industry
newsletter Random Lengths published a benchmark cash price of $325, down $10 from Wednesday, which
sparked selling, the sources said. "We haven't been able to re-establish a level where buyers are willing to

come into the cash market," said Neal Schmaedick, lumber futures analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
Eugene, Ore.
COPPER: Futures fell on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, as speculative
commodity funds sold into the recent rally, participants said. The December contract fell 1.35 cents to 80.15
cents a pound. Some participants' selling was spurred by disappointment that there wasn't a sustained rally
on news of a strike at Union Miniere's Olen copper smelter in Belgium.

WASHINGTON -- The Bank of Mexico has become the first central bank to agree to participate in the
International Monetary Fund's plan to sell up to 14 million ounces of its gold reserves outside the spot
market, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said.
The agency's directors are still debating details of the plan, which is part of a strategy to raise funds for
helping heavily indebted nations, he said.
Under the program, the IMF plans to sell part of its 103-million-ounce gold reserve to central banks of
countries with outstanding IMF loans. The central banks would buy the gold at market prices and then use it
to make payments on loans owed to the IMF.
The IMF's gold sales would, in effect, revalue the 14 million ounces of gold upward to market value. Profits
from the sales are to be invested in market securities and the returns used to partly fund the IMF's debt-relief
program for developing countries.
It was expected that Mexico, with large loan repayments due to the IMF in the wake of an IMF-led
international bailout in 1995, would be one of the first nations to participate in the program.

Gasoline Futures Move Higher as Supplies Shrink

Gasoline Futures Move Higher as Supplies Shrink

NEW YORK -- Gasoline futures led the energy complex higher at the New York Mercantile Exchange
yesterday, as traders fretted over falling supply amid persistent strong demand.
Inventory data Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. gasoline stocks had fallen 1.5
million barrels last week, leaving stocks at 201.6 million barrels, the lowest stock level since October 1998.
Analysts associate gasoline stocks below 200 million barrels with hand-to-mouth, or just-in-time, inventory
policies at U.S. refineries before the 1998 supply glut.
Analysts shrugged off data from the Department of Energy yesterday morning showing an 800,000-barrel rise
in stocks to 201.3 million barrels during the same period. They, instead, viewed the report as confirmation of
the low inventory level in the API data, said Tim Evans, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometrics in New
York.
While stocks fell, demand for the product was a robust 8.8 million barrels a day, up from 8.6 million barrels a
day a week ago and reminiscent of peak summer demand levels.
"There's some worry out there. We have inventory running down, good lateseason demand and refineries
heading into maintenance turnaround," said Jim Fiedler, an energy analyst at ED&F Man in New York. The
early fall typically sees refineries in the U.S. and Europe shut to prepare for peak heating-oil demand in the
winter.
The nearby October gasoline contract jumped to 70 cents a barrel, matching last week's high, which was the
first time a nearby contract hit 70 cents since July 1997. The contract settled a bit lower at 69.84 cents a
gallon, representing a 1.71-cent gain.
Concern about immediate supply also could be seen in the widening of the premium October gasoline held
over November gasoline to nearly three cents a gallon. Traders said tightness in the physical markets,
underscored by the inventory reports, is showing up in the futures market.
Nearby November crude oil followed higher, but traders said crude was hampered by what analysts called
"sell-the-fact" action after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday issued a statement
from its meeting in Vienna confirming output cuts will continue through March 2000.
November crude oil gained 18 cents to settle at $24.12. By comparison, on a barrel basis, October gasoline
gained 71 cents, while November gasoline gained 45 cents.
In agreements in 1998 and 1999, OPEC agreed to cut oil exports by more than 4.3 million barrels a day to
stop the dramatic drop in world oil prices in 1998.
Since February, the crude market has been busy factoring in that falloff in supply, propelling front-month oil to
current prices from a February low of $11.26 a barrel.
In the past few months, a greater sense of concern gripped the market as traders worried that the OPEC cuts
amid peak oil demand in the fourth quarter would lead to a sharp drop in world oil supply.
But with November crude appearing to be dragged higher by gasoline yesterday, some analysts were worried
that the crude oil run-up may be nearing a correction.
"There was a tug of war going on between crude and gasoline. And we'll have to see in the coming days if
crude vetoes a further rally in gasoline," said Pegasus's Mr. Evans.

But analysts, including Mr. Evans, are cautious not to rule out higher prices for the energy complex. There
was a slight touch of winter in the air in New York, reminding traders that an early blast of cold winter could
propel prices toward $30 a barrel.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures made further gains at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange following
strong demand at Tuesday's auction of 25 metric tons by the United Kingdom. The December contract rose
$3.70 to $265.50 a troy ounce. Weakness in the U.S. stock market and rising concerns about inflation are
also supporting gold, analysts said.
COFFEE: Futures fell to contract lows on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange due to selling by producers,
traders said. The December contract dropped 0.85 cent to 81.80 cents a pound, after touching a low of 81.60
cents. "The coffee market isn't seeing a spectacular fall; it is just eroding," said one Chicago-based analyst.

NEW YORK -- The dollar weakened further against the yen, still smarting from the Bank of Japan's decision
Tuesday to keep monetary policy unchanged.
The dollar strengthened against the euro. While the common European currency began global trading by
rising following Tuesday's gains, it tumbled late in New York when the market showed its bias to sell the euro
when the common currency rallies.
Continued heavy selling of euros for yen didn't help the euro's cause either.
All in all, trading in the major currencies was choppy and erratic, as exemplified by the euro's sudden fall in
the New York afternoon. The euro managed to rise as high as about $1.0540 before some speculators,
encountering heavy resistance there, swiftly turned their positions to trigger a chain reaction that sent the
euro down to $1.0410 within two hours.
But the one clear fundamental trend remains yen strength on Japan's improving fortunes.
Traders reported that demand for yen remains strong, despite a 3.4% fall in Japan's Nikkei 225-stock index
early Wednesday and market caution in case officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations speak
out against yen strength at their meetings this weekend.
"Yen strength is structural anyway," said Kathy Jones, currency analyst at Prudential Securities in New York,
citing Japan's huge savings and trade surpluses, compared with the low U.S. rate of saving and the
ballooning U.S. trade deficit.
While the G-7 meeting looms large, the threat of joint U.S.-Japan intervention to weaken the yen has
dissipated substantially following the Bank of Japan's decision not to increase the supply of yen to the market.
Several U.S. traders noted that statements from the International Monetary Fund yesterday ahead of its
meetings did little to clarify currency trends.
The IMF in its World Economic Outlook warned that the dollar remains too strong relative to medium-term
fundamentals such as the U.S. current-account deficit, but IMF Economic Counsel Michael Mussa added that
further yen strength could stall Japan's economy.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 104.10 yen, down from 104.76 yen late Tuesday. The
euro was trading at $1.0445, down from $1.0498. The euro was also trading at 108.72 yen, below 110.19
yen.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6290, down from $1.6327, after falling in late New York trading in line with the
euro's tumble.
The Canadian dollar strengthened on news that Canadian retail sales rose a higher-than-expected 1.3% in
July from June, putting the U.S. dollar at C$1.4704 late yesterday, down from C$1.4762 late Tuesday.
The Australian dollar extended recent gains, helped by a rally in gold and rising commodities prices. It was at
US$0.6510 late yesterday in New York, up from US$0.6483 a day earlier.
The Norwegian krone weakened after the Norwegian central bank cut interest rates a half-percentage point
yesterday, the fifth time it has done so this year. The deposit and overnight lending rates were lowered to
5.5% and 7.5% respectively.

The euro was worth 8.2295 kroner late yesterday, New York time, up from 8.1940 kroner a day earlier.
The Colombian peso continued to suffer selling pressure on speculation the central bank will soon abandon
the peso's trading band, following Chile's decision earlier this month to float its currency.
Colombia's peso closed yesterday stuck to the weakest limit of the day's trading band, even as the central
bank raised the ante and spent $70.1 million to defend it after spending $6 million Tuesday. The U.S. dollar
was worth 1,996.20 pesos late yesterday, from 1991.96 pesos Tuesday.
Currencies across east Asia weakened for the most part. The Thai baht hit another 12-month low against the
U.S. dollar, as Thai firms continued to chase dollars in order to meet quarterly debt-service obligations. The
dollar settled at 40.475 baht in late Asian trading, up from 40.275 baht Tuesday.

Gold Leaps Following Sale by Bank of England

Gold Leaps Following Sale by Bank of England

The same event that clobbered gold prices two months ago boosted them yesterday morning as the Bank of
England sold off 25 tons of the precious metal.
Front-month October gold futures then rose $5.80 to $260.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange. That contrasted sharply with the fallout from the British central bank's first gold
auction in July, which plunged gold futures almost $7 to a new 20-year low.
Market watchers said the difference was in the bidding patterns yesterday, which included far more offers at
or above the bank's asking price. Investors took that as a bullish signal and then sent gold futures soaring.
The latest result underscored the auctions' mostly symbolic importance to the gold market, which has been
softened for months by rumors of possible sales by various central banks. Analysts agree the amount of
British gold being auctioned isn't enough to create a world-wide glut, but they say the government
bearishness represented by such a sale is particularly important.
Or at least it was -- until yesterday.
"Coming in, I don't think the expectations were too good for this auction because of what happened last time,"
said George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities in New York. "The audience was definitely
surprised. Now it's a question of whether this can continue."
Yesterday's auction was the second 25-ton installment of a scheduled 400-ton British sell-off. The bank,
which had set a $255.75 an ounce allotment price, received bids for eight times the tonnage of the metal it
was offering.
But perhaps more significantly, the auction had a "scaling factor" of 58.5%, according to the bank's Internet
site. The scaling factor is the rate at which the bank could fill orders for given amounts of gold at its allotment
price after selling as much metal as possible above that bid.
A higher scaling factor would have meant that there were more orders below the allotment price, a bearish
omen for the overall market. That's exactly what happened at the July auction, when the scaling factor was
91.8%.
Instead, bidders' newfound enthusiasm yesterday caught a gold market that has been poised for a major
price decline off-guard, Mr. Gero said.
Nymex reports show that the number of outstanding gold contracts on the exchange had declined over the
summer to a low of 182,262 on Aug. 20. However, in the last few weeks, Nymex gold open interest has
surged back over 210,000, a sign that Mr. Gero said most likely meant traders anticipating the next British
auction were placing bets for another price decline.
Instead, they quickly had to reverse course yesterday.
"It's amazing," said Gil Atzmon, chief investment strategist for U.S. Global Investors Inc., San Antonio, Texas.
"I've seen gold move $6 before, but I haven't seen it move to the upside in a while."
Most market observers cautioned, however, that, while constructive, the latest auction doesn't represent a
basic change in the market's demand-and-supply backdrop. To see a sustained rally in gold, a fundamental
shift is needed, such as an announcement from Switzerland's central bank saying it has abandoned any
plans to sell gold, market observers said. "With that overhang gone then there'd be justification for a rally,"
said one dealer.

In other commodity markets:
SUGAR: World raw-sugar futures on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange division of the New York Board of
Trade fell due to selling from Cuba and Thailand and by commodity funds, according to traders. The October
contract dropped 0.14 cent to 6.79 cents a pound. Despite the producer selling, some participants said the
absence of Brazilian selling kept some support under the market. Brazil is the world's largest sugar exporter.
LUMBER: Futures fell by their limit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to selling by speculative
commodity funds, analysts said. The November contract dropped $10 to $322.60 a thousand board feet. "The
market gave a sell signal [Monday] -- we saw one fund come in and sell 50 longs on the close," said Bob
Book, lumber analyst with R.J. O'Brien & Associates Inc. in Chicago. Funds sold 150 lots yesterday, Mr. Book
said, taking the November contract down below $330, where sell stops -- preplaced sell orders -- were set off.

Encore (A Special Report)---Catching Up With...Paul Volcker
Encore (A Special Report) --- Catching Up With... Paul Volcker
By Glenn Ruffenach

Sitting at Kennedy International Airport in New York City, waiting for an evening flight to Sydney, Australia,
Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is patiently answering questions about
life at age 72.
But suddenly, a query about the media and its coverage of the central bank prompts a spirited mention of his
successor.
"Alan Greenspan has a much easier press than I ever had!" Mr. Volcker exclaims -- and immediately gives
himself over to laughter.
"I guess things have changed since I was in Washington."
Just a little.
Twenty years ago, in the summer of 1979, the rate of inflation was 13.3%, the price of gold was headed
toward $875 an ounce, and the U.S. economy was in turmoil. That August, President Carter tapped Mr.
Volcker, then 51 years old and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to succeed William Miller
as chairman of the Fed. Neither the man, nor the central bank, has been the same since.
Mr. Volcker, for his part, would become a world figure, eventually taming inflation in the U.S. and helping the
economy regain its balance. Indeed, the announcement in June 1987 of his planned departure from
Washington set off a short-lived financial panic, one that cost the Reserve $513 million -- the amount spent
intervening in foreign-exchange markets to head off a plunge in the dollar.
The Fed, meanwhile, would come to be looked upon as one of the most powerful and respected institutions in
the capital -- a reputation that Mr. Greenspan both has benefited from and continued to build upon. Which
brings us back to the subject of a, well, prickly press.
"When the economy is as strong as it has been and inflation is low, it's not surprising that [reporters']
questions [today] are easier," Mr. Volcker says, laughing again.
If the spotlight has shifted from Mr. Volcker since 1987, his life has been no less busy. Within a year of
leaving the Fed, he became chairman (and later, chief executive officer) of James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a New
York investment-banking firm, and took a part-time teaching job at Princeton University, his alma mater. In
1992, President-elect Clinton briefly considered naming Mr. Volcker Treasury secretary but finally selected
then-Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
Today, the former banker still works six and sometimes seven days a week and travels overseas "at least"
once a month. Where once he had the luxury, he says, of focusing on a single task (managing the Fed), he
now finds life broken into innumerable "bits and pieces." He lists only a handful of his current responsibilities:
serving on a commission that's examining Holocaust deposits in Swiss banks; serving as North American
chairman of the Trilateral Commission; as chairman of the Group of 30; as co-chairman of the Financial
Service Volunteer Corps. His resume lists a dozen others.
"I'm not very good at saying no," he says simply.
He clearly doesn't miss Washington, although he allows that "once in a while, the juices get flowing when a
crisis erupts." If anything, he looks upon the capital today with a certain melancholy. That's because his own
belief in government service as a noble calling has had to contend with the political scandals of recent
decades. "I increasingly share the unfortunate skepticism held by many Americans," he explains, "about
campaign finances and other abuses in Washington."

--- Page 189 ---
Page 189 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
He says he is just as surprised as anyone at the economy's continued strength, as well as its ability to resist
inflationary pressure. And, "I never imagined the stock market would be where it is," he observes. Most
Americans, he adds, are more knowledgeable about the Fed today than during his tenure as chairman --
although too many people, he says, still focus on the Fed's reactions to changes in the economy, when just
as much can be learned from the changes themselves.
Only one other question draws as passionate a response from Mr. Volcker as the mention of the media:
When asked if inflation will ever again become as serious a problem as it was during his tenure at the Fed,
he replies, "If you have been involved with inflation as long as I have, you never relax -- never. It takes
eternal vigilance. I just hope we learned our lessons."
His health "seems to be OK." He tries to walk the couple of miles each day to his office in Manhattan from his
home ("when I don't have too much to carry"). And he has been trying, of late, to force himself to take more
time off. This year, in particular, he says, he has managed to get away several times for his favorite pastime:
fly-fishing. "Salmon more than trout," he notes. Those travels have taken him to Iceland and Canada.
Meanwhile, the cigars he made famous, their tendrils encircling his head in picture after picture in
newspapers and magazines, have long since been abandoned. "March 31, 1987; that was the date I stopped
smoking," he says. "That was a traumatic experience. But I had a bit of a health scare. . . [and] it was
becoming socially unacceptable, to say the least."
Does he ever think about slowing down? About. . . retiring? "I'm not sure what that word means," he answers.
"I half envision myself retiring someday, but not going off to Florida or Arizona.
"Some days, [I] think about the house beside a fishing stream. But that's not going to happen for a while."

NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization and Nasdaq stocks fell, weighed down by weakness in their two key
sectors -- technology and financial services.
The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 2.34, or 0.53%, to 435.90, and the Nasdaq
Composite Index, at 2808.74, dropped 28.52, or 1%.
Several traders said that the choppy, convictionless trading exhibited during yesterday's session was a
microcosm of the essentially directionless trend the stock market has displayed for the past few months.
They noted that the stock market on any given day can surge higher or tumble lower, but that very few of
those sharp moves see significant follow through.
"The market goes down on fears of higher rates, and goes up when those fears are quelled," said Peter
Coolidge, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray & Co. But outside of that, he said, "it's just
drifting."
Singer (NYSE), the sewing-machine company, which is based in Hong Kong, plummeted 1, or 35%, to a
52-week low of 1 7/8. The company said that its outside auditors have suspended an audit of its financial
statements, and that it hired lawyers to investigate problems stemming from an acquisition of assets in
Russia. The company also said its loss widened in both the first and second quarters, and a subsidiary filed
for insolvency proceedings in Germany.
IMRGlobal dropped 5 3/16, or 32%, to a 52-week low of 11 1/4. The Clearwater, Fla., software-services
provider said that it expects to post third-quarter earnings of 12 to 16 cents a share, compared with analysts'
projections of a 25-cent profit, citing delays in the start of several projects and a longer sales cycle. Thomas
Weisel, Lehman Brothers, Adams Harkness and Raymond James all lowered their ratings on the stock.
Covance (NYSE) plunged 4 7/8, or 32%, to a 52-week low of 10 5/8 after the Princeton, N.J.,
biopharmaceutical development service company said that its third-quarter and full-year earnings will fall
below analysts' expectations, citing in part the cancellation of a major contract and "significant" reduction in
the scope of another project.
Philadelphia Consolidated Holding, a Wynnewood, Pa., insurance company, dived 4, or 24%, to a 52-week
low of 12 11/16. The company said that it will record a $3.3 million charge in the third quarter ending Sept. 30
to increase net unpaid loss and loss-adjustment costs for nursing-home and assisted-living multi-peril
package policies issued in prior periods. Advest and A.G. Edwards lowered their ratings.
Serologicals tumbled 1 3/16, or 19%, to 5 after the Atlanta maker of biological materials said that shipping
delays and product-related issues will hurt its third-quarter pretax earnings by as much as $9 million, and that
it expects to record a third-quarter loss on an after-tax basis.
Burlington Industries (NYSE) slid 13/16, or 14%, to 5 1/8. The Greensboro, N.C., textiles and
home-furnishings company said that its fiscal fourth-quarter and fiscal year-2000 earnings will be about 25%
to 30% below analysts' projections. Burlington attributed the weak outlook to world-wide excess denim
capacity that depressed prices. Burlington said that denim accounts for about 17% of its total sales.
C-Cor.net surged 12 1/2, or 53%, to a 52-week high of 36 1/4 after the State College, Pa., designer of
network-distribution products said that it delivered an initial supply of its mini-fiber nodes to AT&T's AT&T
Broadband & Internet Services unit.

--- Page 191 ---
Page 191 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
ArthroCare leapt 15, or 38%, to a 52-week high of 54 1/8. Banc of America raised its rating on the Sunnyvale,
Calif., medical-device company to strong buy from buy.
Bid.Com International, a Mississauga, Ontario, online-auction operator, rallied for a gain of 1 13/16, or 35%,
to 7. The company said that it arranged two new partnerships to sell video products and books, respectively,
on its redesigned Web site. Bid.Com said the agreements are part of its new fixed-price purchasing option,
which it said provides additional opportunities for the company to enter into co-branding relationships.
Impco Technologies, a Cerritos, Calif., maker of alternative-fuel internal-combustion engines, climbed 3
11/16, or 35%, to 14 3/8, following news that BERU AG is offering to acquire Impco for $14 a share.
Internet Gold, an Israeli Internet-service provider, jumped 1 5/8, or 15%, to 12 5/8. C.E. Unterberg Towbin
initiated coverage of the company with a buy rating.
Interpore Cross International, an Irvine, Calif., biomaterials concern, rose 3/4, or 11%, to a 52-week high of 7
13/16 after the company said that it received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its
new BonePlast Bone Void Filler. Interpore said BonePlast is a biocompatible, plaster-of-paris based material
that is replaced with bone during the healing process.
Mr. Coolidge of Brean Murray & Co. says that investors have fallen into a summer-long malaise.
"It's tough to get enthusiastic. There's no real sense of urgency to be in the market," he said.
Moreover, he said that with the outlook for interest rates, and thus the stock market, still in doubt, investors
are having difficulty focusing on what catalyst will drive stocks higher.
As a result, investors can no longer be counted on to view every decline in the market as a buying
opportunity.
Indeed, Mr. Coolidge contends that many investors have recently shifted to a strategy of using rallies as a
selling opportunity, a major shift from the long-standing pattern of buying on signs of weakness.
"The buyers are out there, but they appear to be waiting for a more precipitous dip" before jumping back into
the market, Mr. Coolidge said.
On the Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers 2,217 to 1,579 on volume of one billion shares compared with
911 million Tuesday.

IMF AbandonsProposal to SellSome of Its Gold
IMF Abandons Proposal to Sell Some of Its Gold

WASHINGTON -- Under attack from the gold industry and U.S. lawmakers, the International Monetary Fund
has abandoned its plan to sell $2.56 billion of its gold holdings and is instead likely to opt for a complex
proposal to revalue its gold stash to finance debt relief for poor nations.
The revaluation plan, which has Clinton administration support, will probably be considered by the IMF's 182
member nations at its annual meeting later this month.
The plan "has the advantage that it seems to be politically feasible and wouldn't disturb the gold market
because no gold would be put on the market," said the Dutch Finance Ministry, which disclosed the proposal
on its Web site yesterday.
That could provide a bit of relief for the IMF, which has been facing sharp criticism not only for its handling of
the gold-sale proposal, but also over its controversial loans to Russia and Indonesia.
At the behest of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, the IMF had originally planned to sell 10%
of its 103 million-ounce gold stock on the open market, invest the proceeds and use the profits to finance
debt relief for dozens of the world's poorest countries. President Clinton touted the plan as a centerpiece of
his international economic policy. But the IMF and the Clinton administration were forced to back down amid
loud and unexpected protests from the gold industry, gold-producing nations and lawmakers from
gold-mining states, all of whom worried that a large sale would force down prices.
Under the new plan, the IMF would essentially adjust its books to reflect the true value of 10 million ounces of
its gold, possibly by selling the metal to some national central banks at market prices and then buying it back
again. A holdover from the days when world gold prices were fixed, the IMF gold is currently on the books at
about $48 a troy ounce, about a fifth of its actual market value. The IMF would invest the difference and use
the profits for debt relief and other aid for poor nations.
News of the proposal boosted gold prices for the September contract $1.70 a troy ounce to $255.60 in
trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
However, the plan failed to assuage the IMF's most vehement critics, who tend to oppose any increase in its
global role. "Congress should reject this and any other proposal to provide more taxpayer resources to the
IMF, at least until all the questions are answered about the possible misuse of IMF loans in Russia and
Indonesia," said Rep. Jim Saxton (R., N.J.).
The Dutch Finance Ministry also published the IMF's global economic growth projections for 1999 and 2000,
which the fund planned to release later this month. The report shows the IMF's increasing optimism that the
world is recovering from the after-effects of the financial crisis that began in Asia in July 1997.
The IMF predicts that world-wide economic growth will reach 2.8% this year and 3.4% in 2000. In its last
World Economic Outlook in May, the fund forecast 2.3% growth this year and 3.3% in 2000.
"The growth estimates for all Asian crisis countries have been readjusted upward, and the recessions in
Russia and Brazil are less deep than was initially expected," the Dutch ministry reported the IMF as saying.
South Korea, for instance, is now expected to grow 6.5% this year, instead of the 2% the IMF projected in
May. Japan is expected to grow 0.2% this year, better than the 1.1% contraction the IMF had expected in
May.
The IMF also now predicts 3.7% growth for the U.S. this year, up from the 3% it forecast in May. But the IMF
warns that the Federal Reserve may have to boost interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.

An IMF spokesman said the numbers released by the Dutch are preliminary and could yet be revised before
they are published on Sept. 25.

Russia Expects IMF
To Delay Payment
Of Loan Installment
Russia expects the International Monetary Fund to delay slightly a $640 million loan payout due this month to
allow more time for investigations into the handling of previous IMF loans by the country's Central Bank.
Accounting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers yesterday began a new examination of Russia's Central Bank
focusing on the operations of five banks it controls in Western Europe. An IMF team also is in Moscow to
study the central bank's management of gold and foreign-currency reserves. Both are separate from an
investigation into money laundering involving Bank of New York. Russia's deputy finance minister, Oleg
Vyugin, said the IMF might well delay for a few weeks the release of the second tranche of a $4.5 billion loan
package agreed in July.
Mr. Vyugin also said Russia's gross domestic product this year would grow by at least 2%, the largest growth
in the post-Soviet period that began in 1991. Russia's economy shrank in all but one of the previous seven
years; it grew 0.8% in 1997.
Chairman Launches Bid for Pentland
Pentland Group's chairman, Stephen Rubin, has launched a formal bid to take the British clothing and
footwear company private. The offer of 145 pence ($2.33) a share, which values the company at more than
GBP 500 million ($803.8 million), was unveiled Friday, when Pentland also reported a 33% rise in first-half
earnings to GBP 23.1 million, on a 0.5% sales rise to GBP 254.4 million. The bid has been recommended by
Pentland's independent directors. Mr. Rubin is best known for his $77,000 investment in 1981 in footwear
giant Reebok, a stake he sold 10 years later for $777 million.
EU Plans Labeling for Modified Feed
The European Union plans to require animal feed containing genetically modified ingredients to be labeled as
such, said David Byrne, the EU's health and consumer-protection commissioner-designate. The move would
extend restrictions that already exist on genetically modified foods for human consumption. Mr. Byrne's
statement before European Parliament confirmation hearings Friday in Brussels came amid a heated public
debate in Europe about the safety of both animal feed and genetically modified organisms. About half the
soybeans and corn planted in the U.S. today are genetically modified; a U.S. official who heard Mr. Byrne's
testimony said U.S. soybeans are the "only practical source" of protein for European livestock.
Zurich Financial's Profit Rises 17%
Zurich Financial Services said its first-half earnings rose 17% from a year earlier, boosted by postmerger
restructuring in Britain and its Farmers Group unit in the U.S. The company's chairman said it expects to
"achieve a strong operating result" for all of 1999. The company was created in September 1998 through the
merger of Switzerland's Zurich Insurance and the financial-services business of Britain's B.A.T Industries.
Zurich Financial had first-half profit of $1.69 billion, at the higher end of analysts' forecasts. Zurich Financial
isn't listed but trades through shares of its parent companies, Zurich Allied, on the Swiss exchange, and Allied
Zurich, which trades in London. Assets under management totaled $423 billion at June 30.
Official Signals a British Shift on Euro

The British government signaled a fresh enthusiasm for joining Europe's common currency. Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, in a speech in Tokyo, said the euro "is bringing new strength to the economies that
are part of it," and added: "If the euro brings benefits to its members, we will not let Britain lose out by staying
out." His comments were widely seen as a change of tone, if not actual policy, by the ruling Labor
government.
BRIEFLY:
-- Scottish & Newcastle confirmed it is in talks to buy Greenalls Group's pubs and budget hotels, a transaction
that could be valued at more than GBP 1 billion ($1.61 billion). Scottish & Newcastle is the United Kingdom's
biggest brewer. Greenalls owns 769 pubs and pub restaurants as well as 69 budget hotels.
-- The unemployment rate in the 11 euro-zone countries in July fell to 10.2%, from 10.3% in June and 10.9%
a year earlier, the European Union's statistical office said. The jobless rate for the 15-member EU fell to 9.3%,
from 9.4% in June.
-- Portugal's securities commission has asked insurer Mundial Confianca for more detailed information to
support the company's allegations of irregularities in Banco Comercial Portugues's shareholders meeting on
July 26.
-- Serbia's prime minister, Mirko Marjanovic, said he has secured a deal on Russian natural-gas imports that
his cash-strapped, internationally isolated republic needs to get through winter, according to Serbian state-run
media.

ASIA/PACIFIC
Retail Investors Get Telstra Discount
The Australian government raised the curtain on its sale of a second tranche of shares in Telstra, promising
loyal retail investors discounted shares. The government expects to raise more than 17 billion Australian
dollars ($10.97 billion) from the sale of 16.6% of Telstra, the country's dominant telecommunications
company. After the sale of the second tranche of shares, the government will hold 50.1% of Telstra. Retail
investors are guaranteed to pay 40 cents less per share than institutions. The final price for the
second-tranche shares won't be known until after an institutional bookbuilding process that will start Oct. 5
and close Oct. 15. Telstra closed down 18 cents at A$8.06 a share Monday, but much of that fall was
attributed to the shares trading ex-dividend for the first time. A dividend of 26 cents was factored into the
share price previously.
Standard Chartered to Buy Thai Bank
Thai authorities, after months of negotiations and delay, picked Britain's Standard Chartered Bank to buy
nationalized Nakornthon Bank, the first of four ailing banks the Thai government plans to auction to foreign
buyers by year end. The central bank's Financial Institutions Development Fund accepted an improved offer
from Standard Chartered to pay 12.4 billion baht ($309 million) for 75% of Nakornthon Bank, said Salinee
Wongtal, a central bank official and Nakornthon's acting president.
Seoulbank to Get $3.78 Billion Infusion
South Korea will inject an additional 4.5 trillion won ($3.78 billion) into ailing Seoulbank to make it more
attractive to foreign investors, the Financial Supervisory Commission said Friday, after declaring Seoulbank a
"weak financial institution." The funds include 1.1 trillion won for the purchase of bad loans. Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter of the U.S., Seoulbank's financial adviser, is seeking new management for the bank.
BRIEFLY:
-- The board of Coca-Cola Amatil of Australia agreed to allow San Miguel of the Philippines to sell its 21.5%
stake in the soft-drink concern. Coca-Cola Amatil's other major shareholder is Coca-Cola of the U.S., which
has a 37% stake.
-- Thai Farmers Bank said it will postpone the subscription period for its 1.18 billion new shares until talks are
concluded with the Bank of Thailand on what to do with Phatra Thanakit, the finance company Thai Farmers
wants to cease funding. Its announcement came as the central bank continued to delay releasing details on
how it will assist Thai Farmers in the liquidation of Phatra.

Mexico Raises Bank-Bailout Estimate
The cost of Mexico's bank rescue as of June is estimated at 873.1 billion pesos ($93.28 billion), representing
19.3% of gross domestic product, according to Vicente Corta, the executive secretary of Mexico's deposit
insurance agency, known as IPAB. He told reporters Friday that the net cost of the rescue, excluding
payments already disbursed, is 732.2 billion pesos, or 16.2% of GDP. IPAB's figures are far above the
government's previous estimate of 14.4% of GDP. The updated fiscal cost stems from a reduction in the
expected recovery of assets to 20% of total assets from 30% previously. The government now hopes to
receive 206 billion pesos, or 4.6% of GDP, through the sale of assets assumed from banks following the crisis
triggered by the peso's December 1994 devaluation, Mr. Corta said. He said the Mexican Congress's delay in
approving the creation of IPAB and the restructuring of the bank-rescue program caused the government to
reduce its estimate for asset recovery. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services recently said the cost of the bank
rescue would reach 21% of Mexico's GDP.
Minister Resigns in Brazilian Dispute
Brazil's embattled president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said he accepted the resignation of a key minister
who had criticized and endangered the government's crucial reform drive. Mr. Cardoso said Clovis Carvalho
resigned Friday as development, industry and trade minister after comments he made at a political party
convention Thursday showed a serious policy breach within the cabinet.
BRIEFLY:
-- Ecuador posted a trade surplus of $162 million in July, compared with a deficit of $197 million year before,
the central bank said. For the first seven months of 1999, Ecuador posted a trade surplus of $965 million,
compared with a deficit of $524 million in the year-earlier period.

SAN FRANCISCO -- A year ago, Paul Hansen, a Berkeley, Calif., building contractor, put up some walls,
installed windows and put in a kitchen for the offices of a friend's Internet start-up.
Critical Path Inc. didn't have the cash to pay Mr. Hansen, so it persuaded him to take his payment in stock.
Today, Mr. Hansen's stake in the San Francisco company is worth nearly $600,000. Not bad for work that
otherwise would have paid only about $30,000. "It was really something, it was beyond what I imagined,"
says the 38-year-old, who bought himself a $20,000 race car and who is on the lookout for another "sweat
equity" deal.
"I've got my ear to the ground," he says.
Sweet equity is more like it, and he isn't the only one getting in on the action.
Masseuse Brigitte Stein, 39, landed 200 shares of Bigstep.com, a company here that helps small businesses
get online, when co-founder Andrew Beebe tipped her in stock because he was on her massage table when
he got the idea for his company. Today, her shares, initially valued at less than $60, would be worth more
than 20 times that and could be still more valuable were the company to go public. The German-born Ms.
Stein doesn't even own a computer, but now she would be more than happy if more clients paid her in stock.
"You never know how people will react," she laughs, when they are relaxed.
With stories of young Internet millionaires abounding, a lot of people in Silicon Valley are hoping for such
good fortune. Lawyers, of course, have long demanded equity in exchange for services at early stages of a
new company's development, but the trend now includes landlords, publicity agents, corporate recruiters,
Web-site developers, contractors and even restaurateurs.
Of course, taking stock can be a huge gamble. Despite lofty valuations placed on companies by investors, the
shares are essentially worthless until such corporations go public or are sold, and even amid the craze for
Internet stocks, that is the fate of only a select few companies.
Early in his career, Picasso covered his restaurant tabs with sketches. Kon Leong tried something similar.
Last year, when Mr. Leong was brainstorming with his partners about a new venture, the trio met at the Roast
Baron, a Burlingame, Calif., chicken-and-ribs place near their homes. They spent many hours at the Roast
Baron honing their idea for ZipLip.com Inc., which makes software to securely transmit e-mail, and running up
big food bills. Mr. Leong says the group could have paid cash, but that was money he wanted to put directly
into the business.
Ultimately, Mr. Leong owed "hundreds of dollars," says Soi Tee Lee, the Singapore native who owned (and
has since sold) the Roast Baron. "I just kind of fed them whenever they came in," he recalls. A stock-for-food
swap ensued.
It all began as "a tongue-in-cheek offer," Mr. Lee says. "I had been reading in the paper about start-up
companies and the valuations of companies in the Valley and how people had become very rich by stock
options and things like that, so I said, `Why not?' I mean, the most I would lose is the cost of my chicken and
ribs."
The ZipLip folks took him up on it and gave him about 10,000 shares, which were worth about $800.
To date, Mr. Lee has a pretty good deal going for himself. According to Mr. Leong, ZipLip, which now has
offices in Mountain View, Calif., has raised about $1 million and has a valuation of $6 million. The shares Mr.

--- Page 198 ---

Lee got for those hearty meals are now worth about $12,000, and he has since invested some of his own
money in the venture.
While swapping stock for services can help scrambling entrepreneurs who are short on cash, or in Mr.
Beebe's case, reward people who helped them along the way, the practice also has become something of an
irritant for successful entrepreneurs who know how valuable their stock may well become.
To get space in the Valley's overcrowded real-estate market, for example, some entrepreneurs find
themselves giving up shares to demanding landlords who could lease it to a competitor instead. When Max
Levchin, co-founder and chief technical officer of Confinity Inc. wanted to rent space in Palo Alto, Calif., he
threw in some stock in his company to make it more attractive to Amidi Partners a Menlo Park, Calif.,
real-estate investment partnership, which had bids from four other prospective tenants. And not only did Mr.
Levchin have to give his landlord some stock to win a bidding war for the space; he also had to present his
business plan and explain why his company was a good bet.
"They brought in someone who was well-versed technically and they grilled me to make sure I knew my
stuff," says Mr. Levchin, who anticipated a quiz from real-estate types who knew nothing about technology. "It
was quite an educated conversation."
Mike Ivancich, financial director at Amidi, said his group had never before made an equity investment in a
tenant but didn't want to miss the Internet stock gold rush. After all, Amidi's previous tenant in the space,
Internet search engine Google, got $25 million in venture capital, which put the firm's value at more than $62
million just about two months before it moved to a bigger space.
"We are more open these days to investing in other companies," says Mr. Ivancich. "With Internet stocks
going through the roof, we didn't want to miss out."
Nor did the Internet company that was willing to take a gamble on Eng-Siong Tan's Third Voice Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif. Third Voice, which allows people to "paste" electronic notes on Web sites, needed
AboveNet Communications Inc. to run its Web site -- a $6,000-a-month service. That was money the
company didn't have in it early days.
"Six thousand dollars a month, that's a big burn rate," says Mr. Tan, who is chief executive and co-founder of
Third Voice. He persuaded AboveNet to host Third Voice's Web site for $2,000 a month plus $4,000 a month
in equity for a brief period until the company got enough venture capital to pay its bill in full. That was good for
a while. But now that Third Voice has more than $5 million in funding, Mr. Tan has become a jealous
guardian of his company's stock. "At this point, I don't want to give out equity because it's becoming
valuable," he says.
But that's a pipe dream these days, when stock is almost the only currency many people in the Valley will
accept. Elon Musk, founder of financial-services site X.com, was forced to pay for his domain name in stock
because techies Marcel DePaolis and Dave Weinstein, who owned the coveted one-letter name, refused to
take the nearly $1 million in cash he was offering.
Mr. Musk "wanted to pay us in cash, but we weren't really interested in a onetime cash thing," says Mr.
DePaolis, a software engineer at America Online Inc.'s Netscape Communications. "It's all about upside."
"They're Valley people," Mr. Musk says in reply, "which is why those b---s insisted on equity."

What's More Important Than the Fed?
What's More Important Than the Fed?
By Lawrence Kudlow

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Now that the Federal Open Markets Committee has raised interest rates for what we hope will be the last
time this year, it's time to stop obsessing about Fed policy and turn to what's really important in today's
economy. Thanks to a combination of positive developments, including the far-reaching impact of the
Internet, the long bull market cycle of prosperity is alive and well, regardless of what the Fed does.
Consider all the good news: Treasury bond rates have peaked. Consumer price inflation is running at only
1.7% annually year-to-date, excluding the temporary oil shock. This is considerably less than last year's 2.4%
pace. Technology investment is growing at a phenomenal 40% annual pace, expanding the economy's
long-run potential. Using this technology, worker productivity is increasing 5% a year in the factory sector,
4.5% in nonfinancial corporate America and 3.5% for overall nonfarm business -- faster on the whole than the
3.5% to 4% rise in wages and salaries.
Business profits through midyear have risen 16.5% from 1998, including a 44% gain for computers and
software, 41% in durable goods, 38% in telecommunications, 30% for retailers, 15% for financial services and
12% for capital goods and health care. This explains yearly stock market gains of 31% for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, 26% for the Standard & Poor's 500 and 57% for the Nasdaq.
Industrial production has risen 3.6% in the past year, while factories' capacity to produce is growing at a 4.1%
rate. So the supply side of the economy is expanding rapidly, leaving plenty of room for future growth without
straining resources.
Why all the good news? Because the Internet is more important than the Fed. Easily accessible, low-cost
information and increased competition, the hallmarks of Internet economics, will contribute substantially more
growth with significantly lower prices. Over the past year computer production has increased 41.5%, while
computer prices have fallen 30%. Think of it as deflationary growth, a classic consequence of long-wave
technology cycles.
Record-breaking venture capital investment is nurturing Internet innovation and high technology in general.
PricewaterhouseCoopers reports that venture-backed investments in this year's second quarter hit a record
$7.7 billion, a 104% rise over last year. Internet-related company financing quadrupled, to $3.8 billion. The
number of companies receiving funds more than doubled, to 412 from 174. Investments in this year's second
quarter exceeded the total for all of 1998.
Venture capital is the lifeblood of the new economy. New ventures require seed capital in order to be
commercialized and then brought to the mass market. These record venture-capital flows, undoubtedly
bolstered by the recent decline in the federal tax rate on capital gains, point toward even faster technological
innovation in the next century.
Now back to the Fed. Regrettably, Alan Greenspan & Co. continue to stray off the price rule. Instead, they
have wandered into the historical back alley of Malthusian limits to growth and employment. This
old-economy thinking, epitomized by the discredited Phillips curve trade-off between inflation and
unemployment, reflects the tired wisdom of the economics establishment. Promoting the incongruous policy
prescription of higher interest rates and paydowns of the federal debt, the Fed has even abandoned the
original Keynesian first principle of growth.
Growth is the intellectual dividing line in American politics. Free market supply-siders embrace it; it makes
orthodox economists nervous. Slumps born of austerity policies open the door for economic planners and
bigger government influence. Prosperity from free-enterprise growth has no need for government targets and
controls. The market itself is the most effective regulator of resources.
In monetary policy, market prices are the most efficient regulators of the supply and demand for money.
With gold low and the dollar index high, it is clear that the volume of money provided by the Fed is just about

--- Page 200 ---

right. There is no need to withdraw liquidity or attempt to fine-tune the economy's growth rate. Today's growth
is real, not inflationary.
If the economic establishment continues to press austerity and pessimism, it will be confronted by a tidal
wave of opposition from the shareholders, farmers, seniors, homeowners, Web site operators, venture
capitalists, small-business men and others who make up the new investor class. These asset owners know
that markets, not governments, create wealth. They will not permit new tax, monetary, trade and regulatory
obstacles to impede free enterprise. They know that entrepreneurship spells opportunity.
Think of the Internet as an economic-freedom metaphor for our time. The Internet empowers ordinary people
and disempowers government. The Internet creates wealth, expands growth, produces jobs and spreads
prosperity. Standing behind the Net is the political power of well over 100 million investors and asset owners.
Because of this, I believe the future economy will outperform all expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average will reach 15000, then 30000, then 50000 and higher. Believe it or not, the Internet is more important
than the Fed.

Laundering Probe Could Mean Trouble for Gore, IMF

Laundering Probe Could Mean Trouble for Gore, IMF
By Bob Davis
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Al Gore and the International Monetary Fund are among those who have the most to lose
as a result of an alleged scheme by Russian mobsters to sneak billions of dollars into U.S. accounts.
Vice President Gore's vulnerability comes by virtue of his co-chairmanship with Russia's prime minister of a
commission that oversees U.S.-Russian relations. The IMF is on the hot seat because of allegations that
$200 million of its funds may have been diverted into the banking accounts of Russia's organized-crime
families.
The money-laundering questions deepen an already bitter debate about whether Clinton administration and
IMF policies worsened Moscow's post-Cold War plight, and thus should be blamed for "losing" Russia.
Foreign-policy issues rarely dominate presidential campaigns. But billionaire Republican presidential
candidate Steve Forbes, who has the financial wherewithal to spend millions of dollars on television
advertising, says he intends to put Russia front and center in the coming campaign.
"Gore has been the point man with Russia," says Mr. Forbes. "His policies have been an unmitigated
disaster. They have piled billions of dollars into the hands of kleptomaniacs."
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign is more circumspect -- in part because Mr. Bush's father, former
President George Bush, has been criticized for being ineffective in helping Russia reform itself after the
breakup of the Soviet Union.
"The Bush administration had one year in office after the collapse of the Soviet Union," says Condoleezza
Rice, a former Bush-administration Russia expert who is now the top foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Bush's son.
"This administration has had seven. The real question is what lessons should we learn from policy mistakes
that have been made."
The allegations that U.S. banks helped launder billions of dollars for Russian criminals or that the Russians
got their hands on IMF funds haven't been proved. Investigators say they are looking into both charges.
"The vice president's relationship with world leaders is important to the country, the national security and the
conduct of foreign policy," says Marla Romash, deputy chairman of Mr. Gore's campaign.
But Mr. Gore's defense of his actions concerning the possible money-laundering scheme and diversion of
IMF funds is quite different -- and much more open to attack. His aides say he was out of the loop.
The vice president wasn't ever briefed on the money-laundering probe, says a senior Gore aide. To the extent
that Mr. Gore discussed money laundering with the Russians, he adds, the vice president acted at the behest
of the Treasury Department. "The vice president followed the advice he receives from the Treasury when
counseling Russia on the IMF," the aide says.
Senior aides to Mr. Gore and the administration say that the vice president dealt only twice with
money-laundering issues during meetings of the binational commission on Russia-U.S. relations. In January
1997, Mr. Gore urged Mr. Chernomyrdin to improve Russia's crime-fighting capabilities so Russia could join
international organizations that try to thwart money laundering.
Last month, he urged a new prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, to cooperate with outside audits of Russian
finances that were being conducted at the behest of the IMF and to publish the results. "The vice president
wasn't sitting on foreknowledge that the Russians may have been diverting money from the IMF," says Mr.
Gore's aide.

--- Page 202 ---
Page 202 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But Mr. Forbes, the Republican candidate, dismisses the explanation, in what is likely to be a standard
refrain: "If a man in his position can't accept responsibility or ask questions, he ought to throw in thetowel."
For the IMF, the risk is that a Congress already skeptical of its competence will turn more broadly against the
institution. That would make it more difficult for the Treasury to win approval of IMF-related proposals, such
as a plan for the IMF to sell between $1.5 billion and $3 billion in gold to help reduce debt in the world's
poorest nations.
Already, an odd amalgam of lawmakers oppose the deal, including House Majority Leader Richard Armey of
Texas, a longtime IMF foe, and several dozen members of the Black Congressional Caucus, who fear that
gold sales could harm gold producers in South Africa. The campaign for gold sales appears "to be lost,"
says Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits on the House Banking Committee. Treasury officials
say they are working on new proposals involving the IMF gold that wouldn't affect market prices.
Last fall, after a lengthy battle, Congress approved a $17.9 billion contribution to the fund's reserves. While
the IMF isn't asking for more money now, it usually makes such requests every five years or so. As a result, it
is crucial politically for the fund to maintain good relations with Congress. Other nations won't make
contributions unless they know the U.S. will put up its share.
But the suspicion of massive Russian money laundering is causing some of the IMF's supporters to rethink
how the U.S. should deal with the fund. House Banking Chairman Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican, says it
may make sense for the U.S. to press the IMF to direct its Russian lending to Russia's provinces or to the
other states that once made up the Soviet Union. "There's an issue of how the IMF can or should give
assistance to Russia this time," he says.
Mr. Leach plans to hold hearings next month on the money-laundering allegations and call top regulators. It is
unclear yet whether the committee will ask bankers to testify, including any from Bank of New York Co.,
which is at the center of the probe. Depending on the outcome of congressional and law-enforcement
investigations, bankers may face stiffer regulations. "The principal issue is not whether Bank of New York has
broken our laws," Mr. Leach says, "but whether they facilitated in the impoverishing of Russian people."
For its part, the IMF is continuing its pressure on Russia to tighten its financial practices. A $640 million loan
to Russia in July was transferred to one IMF account from another -- and never passed through Russia. The
proceeds were used to help Moscow repay other IMF loans. Before the IMF approves a second $640 million
payment at the end of September, PricewaterhouseCoopers is supposed to finish a new audit of the central
bank's relationships with a number of offshore entities it controls. PricewaterhouseCoopers has previously
completed two audits.
In addition, IMF officials are looking into a plan that would use Russia as a model for other loan programs.
For instance the IMF might insist that borrowers keep more of their loans within the IMF rather than disburse
the money to the central banks of borrowing countries.
IMF loans are generally used to bulk up a borrowing nation's reserves and to assure investors there are
adequate funds in case they want to change local currencies into dollars. But the most successful IMF
programs accomplish this by soothing fears and forestalling capital flight; little of the IMF money actually gets
spent. So, some IMF officials argue, loans could be kept at the IMF and accomplish the same goals. That
would greatly reduce the chances that a nation's central bank or commercial borrowers could misuse IMF
funds.
However it is far from clear that the IMF borrowers, who already chafe at IMF supervision, would go along
with such a proposal -- or whether the IMF's senior management would even dare to present the proposal to
the fund's 182 members.

Energy Prices Slip as Bret Causes Little Damage

Energy Prices Slip as Bret Causes Little Damage

Crude-oil and natural-gas prices fell after it became clear Hurricane Bret hadn't stifled drilling in the Gulf of
Mexico past the weekend, as feared.
Reports filtering from energy producers depicted only brief interruptions on Saturday, when Bret passed
through the Gulf with force similar to Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in 1992. But when
drill crews, like most Texans, returned to the areas they had evacuated, they found surprisingly little damage,
analysts said.
Front-month crude oil fell 37 cents on the news to $21.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and
natural gas declined 0.5 cent to $3.059 per billion BTU's after rising more than 30 cents in the days leading
up to Bret, the worst hurricane to hit Texas in 20 years.
Traders described the setback as a relatively minor one for crude oil, which has generally been rallying in
recent weeks. But they remain more concerned about the prospects for natural gas, which remains near
historic highs for this time of year despite strong supply and a premium based almost entirely on storm
damage that didn't materialize.
The nation's natural-gas stocks are about 5.6% below their year-ago levels, which has led traders to bid up
prices recently. However, those production numbers are skewed by last year's record yield, so there is no
true shortage, said Guy Gleichmann, senior trader for Futures Trading Group, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"It's like a mother constantly going to the kitchen to make sure that there's enough milk for the kids. But
there's plenty in the fridge," Mr. Gleichmann said.
For oil, the outlook should remain bullish as long as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries sticks
to its planned schedule of production cuts, said John Kilduff, senior vice president for energy risk
management at Fimat USA.
"People are just taking back some of their gains today, but in the long run, this doesn't change much," he said
of yesterday's market activity.
Also weighing on energy markets was the announcement by Germany that it planned to sell 34 million barrels
of its crude-oil reserves. Combined with the lack of damage from Bret, that announcement helped continue
oil's recent history of not maintaining price levels above $22 a barrel, according to energy analyst James R.
Steel of Refco.
Energy firms Conoco Inc., Apache Corp., Costal Corp. and BP Amoco all reported they had returned staff to
their drilling rigs after brief delays Saturday. Two of the companies estimated they had written off a combined
140 million cubic feet of natural-gas production for the day, which Mr. Gleichmann characterized as a minimal
loss.
"Overall, this was a bear day in a bull market," Mr. Steel said of the energy complex. "But I don't see it as a
pullback of any kind."
In other commodities markets:
COPPER: The September copper contract rose 1.65 cents on the Comex division of Nymex to 75.55 cents a
pound as consolidation among copper producers and recovering Asian demand continue to buoy the metal's
price, analysts said. In particular, the prospect of Phelps Dodge Inc. buying smaller competitors Cyprus Amax
Minerals Co. and Asarco Inc. would be a most-bullish scenario for investors, said John E. Gross, publisher of
the weekly Copper Journal. "Copper is a cost-intensive commodity, and it is the low-cost producer who does

best at the end of the day," he said. "That's Phelps Dodge in this situation." The two smaller firms have also
proposed merging with one another at a time when copper prices remain almost 25% of what they were just
two years ago, before the Asian financial crisis.
GOLD: August gold prices fell $1.50 to a 20-year low of $253.50 an ounce on Comex. Large gold-carry
trades, heavy producer selling, and the scheduled sale of more British central-bank gold on Sept. 21
continue to weigh on the market, said George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities in New York.
"Everybody knows another 8,000 contracts will be sold the day of the auction, so there are some people
taking advantage of that public information by selling now," he said. He said the number of gold contracts
outstanding on Comex has declined almost 5,000 recently, a signal that many investors are liquidating their
positions, effectively getting out of the market.

Gold futures fell at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange as a burst of selling by
speculative commodities funds wiped out gains from a recent interlude of bullishness.
Although traders said the funds were the immediate cause of price weakness, they said the market remains
hobbled by longer-term bearish factors, including large gold-carry trades, producer selling and the next Bank
of England auction in September.
The December Comex contract declined $3.40 to $256.20 a troy ounce.
"It was pretty much all fund-related selling," said Tim Gardiner, head of precious metals at Mitsui USA in New
York. "There was also the tail end of some people bailing out of long positions built over the last couple of
weeks."
Comex gold rallied in the first part of last week, reaching $264.70 an ounce on Wednesday, which traders
said resulted in more long positions, or bets that prices would rise.
Six-month lease rates for goldcharged by bullion banks for loans of the metal for that period -- were being
quoted yesterday at around 4%, up from a typical level under 1%. Traders saw that as evidence of more
gold-carry trades, which involve borrowing gold to sell it, then investing the cash in other assets.
"Not only do we have producer selling, central-bank selling and leaseholder selling, we don't have
investment buying," noted George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities in New York.
Australian producers were selling last week, as a weakening of the Australian dollar enabled them to lock in
prices at a higher level in U.S. dollar terms.
A trader on the Comex floor said the market faces more such selling by producers to protect themselves
against price weakness, because of the higher earnings reported by companies engaging in such "hedging."
His concern, endorsed by Mr. Gero, was that producer selling would accompany new production coming on
line from Latin America.
"The biggest worry is who's going to [buy] the excess," Mr. Gero said.
Traders in Japan said earlier that demand for physical gold was supporting prices around $256, but U.S.
traders said the market seemed set to test lower levels.
Another source of bearishness was the Sept. 21 Bank of England auction of 25 metric tons of gold, given that
prices fell $6 in wake of the first such auction in July. The United Kingdom plans to sell 415 metric tons of the
815 tons it holds in reserves.
Mr. Gardiner of Mitsui said trading at the Tokyo Commodity Exchange today could be important because of a
large number of long positions that might be sold, as participants try to minimize losses.
In other commodities markets:
HOGS: Futures on hogs rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in response to strong buying by packers
in the cash market, analysts said. The October contract added 1.77 cents to 46.42 cents a pound. Dan
Vaught, analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, said, "The cash market is what's driving this" rally in
futures. He added that "there's also some spillover from the pork market," referring to gains in CME pork-belly
futures.

COTTON: Futures slipped on the New York Cotton Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade
because of rains in cotton-growing areas in the Southeast, traders said. The October contract dropped 1.1
cent to 51.13 cents a pound. "There were some beneficial rains in the Southeast, relieving some of the recent
heat stress in those areas," said Ray Streker, a trader at LFG Inc., a commission house in New York. "And
even with the hurricane [Bret] hitting some of the crop areas, a good chunk of cotton has already been
harvested, so nobody got scared."

WIND Group
To Retry Ousting
Telekom Directors
WIND Telecommunicazioni will try again next month to oust two board members representing partner
Deutsche Telekom, as the fallout from the German group's failed attempt to merge with Telecom Italia
continues to spread. WIND, the fixed and mobile-telecommunications group controlled by Italian electric utility
ENEL, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, has been under serious strain since Deutsche Telekom tried
last spring to merge with the group's main competitor. Because of that move, WIND and France Telecom
have said they consider their partnership with the Germans effectively finished, and have been looking to oust
Deutsche Telekom's two representatives from WIND's board.
WIND said Friday that it has called a shareholders meeting for Sept. 14 or 15 to expel the German group's
two board members. WIND made an attempt in July to dismiss the directors, but was blocked from doing so
because of technical reasons stemming from a decision in a German court regarding a complaint Deutsche
Telekom had filed to block such a move. Now WIND will base its ouster attempt on an Italian law allowing for
the disenfranchisement of board members who have allegedly failed to fulfill their responsibilities to a
company. WIND claims that a negative vote by ENEL, which holds 51% of WIND, is sufficient to expel the
two board members.
StoraEnso to Shed Power Assets
Nordic paper group StoraEnso said it will sell power assets with an estimated market value of two billion
euros ($2.13 billion) and vowed to explore further expansion in Europe and Asia. The Finnish-Swedish paper
group said it wants to focus on producing publication papers, fine papers and packaging boards and shed
power assets not located at its Nordic paper mills, about half of all its electrical power operations. The
announcement sent the company's share price climbing 4.95% Friday in Stockholm, to 116.5 kronor ($14.18).
StoraEnso's move is part of a painstaking consolidation in the paper industry, where, in the wake of financial
turmoil in Asia, several big competitors are trying to ease their perennial struggles with overcapacity and
reduce wide swings in paper and pulp prices.
No Need for Rate Move, Official Says
Edgar Meister, directorate member of Deutsche Bundesbank, doesn't see the need for an interest rate move
by the European Central Bank in the near future. "In comparison to the U.S., where signs of a slight upward
interest rate correction are increasing amid continuing robust growth and the danger of inflationary tensions,
the situation in Europe is still relatively relaxed," he said. Mr. Meister doesn't hold any policy-making post on
the ECB's governing council, but acts as an adviser to Bundesbank's president, Hans Tietmeyer, who sits on
the ECB's governing council. Separately, Mr. Tietmeyer said the euro is on the right path, and that he is
"altogether very satisfied" with the development of Europe's common currency. He also said the internal
stability of the euro is as solid as was the mark in its best times.
BRIEFLY:
-- The International Monetary Fund may withhold aid to cash-strapped Ukraine because of the government's
failure to stop subsidizing public utilities, a Ukrainian official said.

ASIA/PACIFIC
Trade Authorities Halt Hitachi Exports
Hitachi Electronics said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry was punishing it for a violation of
Japan's foreign-exchange and foreign-trade laws by ordering a halt in all of the company's exports for 15
days. Hitachi Electronics said it saw the matter as extremely serious, and already had taken exhaustive
measures aimed at preventing a recurrence. In February, police arrested Isao Sasaki, a former managing
director of Ryokosha KK, on suspicion that Ryokosha exported Hitachi Electronics' precision-measuring
devices to China without permission from the trade ministry. Japanese trade law requires that exporters
receive official approval before selling such sensitive equipment overseas. Ryokosha, a wholesaler of
precision instruments, receives orders for Hitachi's products, which it then sells both domestically and abroad.
Seoul Court All But Acquits Ex-Officials
A South Korean court all but acquitted former Finance Minister Kang Kyong Shik and another ex-official, who
were charged with negligence of duty and abuse of power over the country's worst economic crisis in nearly
half a century. The Seoul District Court's decision on the negligence charges clears the men of responsibility
in the economic collapse that led once-highflying South Korea to ask for a $58.35 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund in December 1997. Mr. Kang was found guilty of charges that he abused power
to pressure banks to give loans to troubled companies, but on those charges the court decided to suspend
sentencing for two years, which means Mr. Kang will be pardoned if he commits no other crime in that time.
Kim In Ho, chief economic secretary to the president during the financial crisis, who also was on trial for the
same charges, received the same verdict.
Taiwan's Recovery Is Firmly on Track
Taiwan said its stronger-than-expected economic recovery is firmly on track, as foreign demand for
electronics continues to drive exports. A rebounding stock market and recent compromises by the
government to rescue two large construction projects also will boost the economy, which has been lagging
recently but is seen growing at a faster pace next year, economists said. Taiwan raised its 1999 forecast for
gross domestic product growth to 5.74%, from 5.07%.
BRIEFLY:
-- Thailand's Senate approved a draft bill to allow foreigners to participate in more sectors of the domestic
economy, but has amended the draft to tighten some of the access the government wanted to grant.
-- Indonesia's government forces boosted security around a natural-gas refinery in a field partly owned by
Mobil in North Aceh, Sumatra, after arsonists set a building in the compound on fire.
-- Labor unions won't be an obstacle in restructuring Daewoo Group, said the head of the Tripartite
Commission, set up to deal with South Korea's labor issues.

THE AMERICAS
Premier of British Columbia Resigns
British Columbia Premier Glen Clark resigned Saturday following the release of a court document alleging he
used his influence to help a friend obtain a casino license. The premier's resignation, which culminates a
series of missteps for his provincial New Democrat party, casts further doubt on the future of one of the last
remaining socialist governments in North America. Mr. Clark's political popularity has nose-dived in the past
two years as mounting government deficits and huge cost overruns on a government-funded ferry project
have compounded the province's economic problems. Mr. Clark strenuously denied the allegations against
him and predicted he will be exonerated. No criminal charges have been brought against him. Dan Miller, the
British Columbia deputy premier, was named acting premier.
Venezuelan Devaluation Worries Ease
The rebound in oil prices reduced expectations of a forced devaluation of Venezuela's bolivar, the Congress's
Economic and Financial Assessment Office said in a report for the first half of the year. The rebound has
meant not only an increase in foreign reserves -- along with interest rates, a principal instrument in the

defense of a currency -- but reduced inflation expectations, given that devaluations often fuel inflation. The
office figured that $5.5 billion left the country during the past year and a half, with about $400 million of that
occurring in the first semester of this year. Venezuelans are taking money offshore not just because of
devaluation worries, but also because of an uncertain political and economic outlook. The rebound also
sustains the overvaluation of the bolivar, estimated at 30% to 50%. The currency closed at 616 pesos per
dollar Friday in New York.
Peru Military Takes Control of Huaraz
Peru's military took control Friday of the highland Andean city of Huaraz to halt a two-day protest against two
nearby Canadian mining companies. Schools, public buildings and most businesses stayed shut, and public
transportation remained at a standstill that morning, despite the removal of stone barricades and burnt tires
from the roads. Thousands took to the streets Thursday at the behest of Mayor Waldo Rios to demand a
greater share of jobs and profits from the Antamina copper-zinc mine and Barrick Gold's Pierina gold mine. A
Barrick official said the mayor's complaint is with the central government, not the mine. Antamina officials
declined to comment.

The Fed's Annual Itch
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Fed's Annual Itch
847 words
23 August 1999
The Wall Street Journal
J

(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Federal Reserve gurus convene tomorrow to decide monetary policy, just before packing their bags for their
annual retreat in the Tetons. The scene seems weirdly familiar. As summer draws to a close, the economy is
growing smartly, thank you. Inflation has made itself so scarce most analysts can barely find it. But what's
emanating from the Fed is an itch to tighten, sending the bond markets into a shimmy. Wall Street is holding
its collective breath for fear the Fed's Open Market Committee might raise interest rates because everything
is going too well.
Haven't we been here before? Yes, just a year ago. In his July 1998 testimony to Congress, Chairman
Greenspan warned: "Should pressures on labor resources begin to show through more impressively in cost
increases, policy action may need to counter any associated tendency for prices to accelerate, before it
undermines this extraordinary expansion." This July's testimony brought similar talk, with Mr. Greenspan's
warning that the Fed would have to act "promptly and forcefully" if the lively job market led to any signs of
rising prices.
Last time around, with the Jackson Hole meeting in progress, we wrote "Time to Relax, Alan," pointing to
falling sensitive prices and even an inverted yield curve -- the classic interest-rate sign of recession, with
short rates climbing above long rates. Returning from Wyoming, the Fed could see the Asian crisis about to
penetrate the U.S. markets. That fall Mr. Greenspan went on not to tighten but to ease interest rates thrice --
in our estimation averting a nasty world recession.
The most overt reason for the current tightening talk, of course, was the Fed's small tightening in June. It
went ahead to boost its target rate on Federal Funds by one-quarter, despite the surprise of a totally flat
consumer price report. It did add some verbiage suggesting it didn't really mean it: "Owing to the uncertain
resolution of the balance of conflicting forces in the economy going forward, the FOMC has chosen to adopt a
directive that includes no predilection about near-term policy action." Not surprisingly, markets are confused.
As the gurus weigh whether to tighten further, we only hope they look over their shoulders at their own
experience. In particular, last fall they also itched to tighten, but suddenly found themselves instead easing
aggressively. Where is all the resulting inflation?
If the Fed's main job is to keep the price level steady, the result has been one of the most stunningly
successful years in generations. Inflation year-on-year, since that fretful July of 1998, has been an official
2.1%. Given the upward bias of Consumer Price Index measurements, the real number may be practically
zero.
The good news about low inflation stretches right up to last week's CPI numbers for July. Were price level a
piece of furniture at the Fed, it would still look steady enough for board members to safely rest their coffee
cups upon it at tomorrow's meeting. Insofar as gold remains an indicator, it signals -- if anything -- deflation.
Commodities generally, after a dip this past year, are about where they were this time last year. Another
interesting indicator, the spread between inflation-indexed Treasury bonds and non-indexed T-bonds, has
been holding steady -- again, suggesting no inflation. Bank lending -- which enlarges the money supply and
is therefore the kind of thing that unlike jobs, or growth, really can lead to inflation -- has been steady since
last October. There just aren't a lot of credible warning flags out there.
Vigilance against inflation is a useful thing. But it works best when grounded in good sense about how the
world works; instead, the air is now filled with theories that have no business on the road in today's
fast-moving global markets. Will Mr. Greenspan's team ever get over the much-discredited Phillips Curve
notion that the way to prevent inflation is to take away jobs and trash growth? Over at Larry Summers's
Treasury, the latest brainstorm is that paying off government debt is an elixir for low interest rates, though of
course rates plummeted as debt accumulated in the 1980s. At the end of a hot, sticky summer in our nation's
capital, patience and cool reasoning can be hard to come by.

Happily, the air is clearer in the Tetons. We hope Mr. Greenspan and friends delay anything dramatic until
they have had a chance to take a few deep breaths. So our advice is to enjoy the mountains. Maybe by the
time next month's inflation numbers start rolling in, there will be something to worry about. Or it may just turn
out that this year's fret over inflation on the horizon has been about as pointless as last year's -- that things
are fine. In which case the Fed will be in a good spot to congratulate itself that instead of choking growth, it
has begun to learn from its own success.

Nymex Aluminum Contract Buffeted by Mergers

Nymex Aluminum Contract Buffeted by Mergers

The New York Mercantile Exchange has struggled in its attempt to get back into the aluminum-futures
business.
Now comes news that five major aluminum producers may soon merge into two, which on its face should hurt
Nymex's effort even more by reducing the number of potential customers for the futures product. But market
participants say there are already so few investors in the new aluminum contract on Nymex's Comex division
that removing a few more potential ones will make a negligible difference.
In fact, the exchange is hoping just the opposite -- that a more-focused competition between two major
players will highlight the need for an aluminum market outside Europe, home of the dominant London Metal
Exchange.
Either way, Comex traders expressed frustration last week over their market's latest attempt to drum up
aluminum business, saying the new contract's survival may ultimately rely on a broader range of metal users,
such as car makers, airlines and soft-drink bottlers, in addition to producers.
"It certainly hasn't been as popular as we would have liked," Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport said of the
new aluminum contract, which began trading May 14. "But we actually think there'll be more of an opportunity
for business now. There'll be more of a need for an aluminum market in this time zone."
Open interest, or the number of outstanding contract commitments to buy or sell aluminum, has leveled off
slightly this month at Comex, slipping below 2,000 for much of August after what had been a steady period of
growth since the contract's launch. The volume of contracts changing hands has been in the single- or
double-digits almost half of the trading days this month.
The slippage at Nymex has coincided with the proposed combination of American aluminum giants Reynolds
Metals Co. and Alcoa Inc. In addition, Alcan Aluminium Ltd. of Canada, Pechiney SA of France and Alusuisse
Lonza Group AG of Switzerland are proposing a union that would create the world's largest aluminum
producer.
Such consolidation in other industries has stifled new commodities contracts in the past or led to less liquidity
in existing markets by reducing the number of buyers and sellers. Typically, both users and producers of a
commodity will use futures markets to protect themselves against price fluctuations.
But at Comex, the new aluminum merger mania may not have that effect, since many market participants
doubt the producers involved in the deals use the New York contract anyway.
Also, the mergers wouldn't eliminate the companies' need to hedge, just the way they do it, said aluminum
analyst Stewart R. Spector, who publishes a newsletter, Spector Report.
"There could be a modest decline in dealing with the LME or Comex, but what the mergers would really be
more likely to affect is the amount of business the producers do with traders," he said. "They would just swap
materials internally instead."
Right now, the LME is by far the more dominant outlet for aluminum hedgers. Comex investors are currently
committed to delivering 8,804 metric tons; the LME contracts cover 790,625 metric tons.
This isn't the first time that the New York exchange has tried to get a chunk of LME's aluminum business.
Comex offered an aluminum contract from December 1983 to July 1993, although it ultimately failed to draw
business because its delivery and supply terms were too similar to the LME futures, said Nymex
spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits.

--- Page 214 ---
Page 214 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"The only similarity between the two is the word aluminum," agreed one veteran base-metals trader, who
blamed the latest contract's slow start on poor marketing instead.
Another trader said the Comex contract's "only hope" lies in either soaring aluminum prices or more
enthusiasm from big producers to use it as a hedging tool.
"Right now, they're obviously either taking a wait-and-see approach, or they don't care at all," he said.
"Otherwise, it would have more volume."
In other commodities markets:
HOGS: Good demand for pork and positioning ahead of Friday's Agriculture Department cold-storage report
sent hog futures soaring at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, market watchers said. The nearby October hog
contract closed 1.45 cents higher Friday at 44.65 cents a pound. The December contract closed 0.72 cent
higher at 42 cents a pound. The Agriculture Department said the stocks of frozen bellies on hand was up
122% from the same time last year and represented a record amount of bellies in cold storage for July.
COPPER: Copper futures closed lower in a choppy, up-and-down session on the Comex, after news of a
merger proposal among major copper producers. The nearby September contract fell 0.7 cent to close at
74.05 cents a pound. Traders said copper futures first rose as news spread that Phelps Dodge Corp. offered
to acquire both Asarco Inc. and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co., then fell when Asarco and Cyprus rejected
Phelps Dodge's offer. "The market came off just as fast as it went up," said a New York copper trader. After
the market closed, Phelps Dodge had sweetened its offer to a share swap valued at about $2.64 billion.
GOLD: Gold sputtered into the weekend, as late dealer selling and liquidation dragged Nymex gold futures
lower, traders said. The benchmark December contract fell $1.60 to close at $259.60 a troy ounce. Traders
said there were indications of hedge-selling by producers, as well as selling by commodity funds as they
adjusted their ratio of gold to silver. Comex September silver rose 3.5 cents to $5.255 an ounce. Traders said
the gold market looks as if it is on hold, waiting to see if U.S. interest rates rise this week.

Dollar Declines Against Yen and Euro On Wider-Than-Expected Trade Gap

NEW YORK -- The dollar was dealt another heavy blow when an unexpected widening in the U.S. trade
deficit for June sent the dollar tumbling against most major currencies.
With consensus forecasts earlier predicting a narrower deficit of $20.8 billion, the announcement at 8:30 a.m.
EDT that the monthly trade gap had ballooned to a record $24.6 billion from a revised $21.17 billion in May hit
the U.S. currency hard in the New York session.
"People were positioned for a little bit better number, so when they didn't get it, boom," said Ralph DelZenero,
vice president, foreign exchange at First Chicago.
European currencies were the biggest beneficiaries, with the euro jumping two cents on the news before
steadying comfortably above the $1.06 level for the remainder of the trading day. The Swiss franc and British
pound charted similar surges.
The dollar initially nosedived against the yen also, briefly hitting a low of $110.68, its lowest level since Jan.
12, before swiftly reversing course to move back above 111 yen.
On Jan. 12 the Bank of Japan intervened to weaken the Japanese currency. Fears of the same happening
again -- perhaps this time with U.S. assistance -- were cited as a reason for traders' reluctance to take the
dollar even lower yesterday.
Late yesterday in New York, the dollar was trading at 111.63 yen, down from 111.91 yen late Wednesday.
The euro was trading at $1.0638, up from $1.0522. The euro was also at 118.75 yen, up from 117.75 yen.
Sterling was at $1.6175, up from $1.6027.
The only major currencies that actually weakened against the dollar yesterday were the Australian and
Canadian dollars, which were hurt by a mixture of a technical factors, a declining gold price and concerns
about widening interest-rate differentials with the U.S.
A wider U.S. trade deficit is a problem for the dollar because it also implies a widening in the current-account
deficit, which must be financed with inflows of capital from overseas. Either U.S. interest rates need to go
higher to attract those funds or the dollar must weaken to boost export competitiveness and improve the trade
balance.
The euro also was helped by German economic data in the European session. The Ifo West German
Business sentiment index rose for the third consecutive month, to 93.6, in July. Because these data helped
reinforce beliefs that Europe's largest economy is in recovery, they gave the euro a quick burst of buying.
Even so, the European Central Bank isn't expected to raise European interest rates before the Federal
Reserve tightens U.S. monetary policy, which is widely expected at a meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee next week. The robust import segment of yesterday's trade report further underscores the strength
of the U.S. economy and the risk of overheating that the Fed is keen to contain.
Michael Rosenberg, head of currency research at Deutsche Bank in New York, said an official rate increase
should lead to a widening in rate differentials between the U.S. and Europe that would "in the long run," boost
the dollar.
Recently, however, "the failure of [market] rates to move meaningfully higher in the U.S. has been a major
drag on the dollar since July," he argued.

This sort of fundamental reasoning is less applicable to the yen's recent performance, Mr. Rosenberg and
others say. The Japanese currency's movements are being driven by capital flows, with a surge in Japanese
stocks over recent days the defining factor.
In this environment, market participants seemed to have reached their yen limits yesterday, having built up
unsustainable short positions in the dollar and the euro. The yen's brief rally against the dollar early yesterday
thus offered some traders a chance to buy cheap dollars. As yen were then sold in the brief dollar
short-squeeze that followed, the Japanese currency fell even further against its European counterparts.

`Carry Trades' Could Be Problem for Gold Market
Commodities
`Carry Trades' Could Be Problem for Gold Market

Gold's relentless price slide in the past three years has spurred more investors to undertake what are known
as gold "carry trades" -- essentially, low-interest loans using borrowed gold.
But the trades could be a problem for the gold market if investors suddenly have to unwind them, as
investors did with the popular carry trades involving the Japanese yen in the fall.
The gold carry trades involve borrowing gold from banks at prevailing low interest rates, selling or using it,
then using the proceeds to buy higher-yielding assets such as Treasurys. The low borrowing rates, combined
with weak gold prices, make repaying the loans inexpensive, even for manufacturers who must replace
borrowed metal they have turned into finished goods.
But if the gold price spikes and borrowers are forced to cover their short positions, some say the effect could
resemble the turmoil caused by the reversal in the yen carry trade, when the dollar nose dived and investors
were forced to get out of high-risk assets. Treasurys, already under pressure from concerns over U.S.
inflation risks, could be among those markets to suffer in the fallout.
Limited disclosure means no one can ever really know the full extent of the gold carry trade. But more people
in the market are talking about it, and London-based Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. this year made its first
reference to the carry trade in its closely watched annual survey of the gold market.
"For many years a significant quantity of gold has been borrowed as a source of cheap finance," Gold Fields
said in its report. "The arbitrage has in fact been remarkably similar to (though far smaller than) the famous
'yen carry trade.' "
Gold Fields managing director Philip Klapwijk later told analysts he estimated the size of those positions to
be 400 metric tons -- worth about $3 billion at current rates.
At this stage, there isn't a lot of knowledge about the gold carry trade outside the gold market. That could
suggest Wall Street's risk-hungry clients aren't as enamored with the idea as they once were with the
equivalent yen strategy.
In that sense, it presents less of a systemic risk. Conservative policies adopted by hedge funds and other
institutions after the fall crisis may have had a constraining effect.
There is no question, however, that the gold carry trade has been an attractive deal for some market
participants.
From the time gold peaked at around $417.50 a troy ounce in February 1996 until just recently, gold leasing
rates rarely rose above 1%, while long-term Treasury yields have been either side of 6%. That is a healthy
spread. However, lease rates, which reflect the cost of borrowing gold, shot above 4% last week, with some
market observers speculating that year-2000 fears and liquidity concerns were behind the jump in rates.
Traders said those factors also helped drive the price of front-month gold futures down $1.80 to $260.30 per
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday.
"The locals and the speculators are selling, essentially saying, 'Gee, let's try this market again another time,' "
said George Gero, first vice president of Prudential Securities in New York. "The market is essentially down to
the funds and trade houses now."
For those investors, who reportedly are also among the heaviest gold borrowers, a continued increase in
lease rates could portend a sudden and damaging short-covering rally in the metal. Such a scramble would

be of huge benefit to the price of gold, although it would be unlikely to move other markets significantly, said

"I don't think [the gold carry trade] is a big deal," he said. "I think that sometime down the road, it will get
unwound. But I've never believed it's been large enough to create any systemic risk."
In other commodity trading:
COPPER: Prices fell on the Comex on the prospect of an end to strikes at a Canadian mine and at Chilean
ports. The September Comex copper contract declined 2.5 cents to 74.55 cents a pound. Highland Valley
Copper was due to present new proposals to workers at its mine in British Columbia today, union officials
said. The mine, which produces about 170,000 metric tons of copper a year, has been closed since May 15
due to the failure of management and workers to forge a cost-cutting agreement. Also, a Chilean radio station
reported yesterday that striking dockworkers were set to sign an accord with the government to end a walkout
that has crippled the nation's three largest ports. Exports of copper from Chile -- the world's largest producer
-- have been held up by those strikes and by another unrelated strike at the port of Iquique.
LUMBER: Futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange due to a weak cash market and technical, or
chart-related, factors, analysts and traders said. The September contract slid its $10 limit to $354.30 a
thousand board feet. "The cash market has just died," said Roger Ovens, account executive at Refco Futures
Ltd. in Vancouver. He added that selling was accelerated by a fall through $357, where there were sell-stops,
or preplaced sell orders.

ISTANBUL, Turkey -- A powerful 45-second earthquake cut a swath through Turkey's industrial heartland
yesterday, killing thousands of people, shutting businesses, wrecking major power lines and jolting national
confidence just as the economy showed signs of leaving this year's recession behind.
The temblor surged from deep under the Marmara Sea at 3:02 a.m. local time. Turkish seismologists said the
earthquake measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, and U.S. scientists in Golden, Colo., say it may have peaked
as high as 7.8. In Istanbul, Turkey's biggest city and financial center 50 miles west of the epicenter, the quake
brought down buildings, triggered a cacophonic downtown chorus of car and shop alarms and sent many in
the population of 10 million out onto the streets.
Among those shaken awake was U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, in Turkey for talks on Caspian oil
and natural-gas pipeline projects.
"We were shaking," he said later in his 12th-floor hotel suite. "I could see lights going out, people running in
the streets. The light was going out, the power was going out," he said. "I can tell you having experienced an
earthquake before, in Mexico: This was a very strong earthquake."
Because telephone lines and power went down over much of northwestern Turkey, the rest of the nation only
gradually learned about the nightmare that unfolded along the seismic fault line from Istanbul to Ankara 250
miles to the east. The semiofficial Anatolian news agency late yesterday put the death toll at 2,011, and said
10,764 were injured. But those figures could climb.
No Americans or other foreigners in Turkey were immediately reported hurt. Istanbul's Ottoman and
Byzantine monuments appeared undamaged. The Turkish straits remained open throughout.
Closer to the epicenter, people were thrown out of their beds by the force of the quake. Panic seized the
worst-hit urban areas of Izmit, Golcuk and Yalova. People broke ankles and legs leaping from windows and
balconies. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of poorly constructed concrete apartment buildings crumpled into
pancake piles of rubble. Survivors huddled in the blacked-out streets, huddling fearfully during strong hourly
aftershocks.
Medical help was minimal. One regional hospital had collapsed. Another had just one working operating
theater, and the chief doctor said most surgical implements had been shaken out of their antiseptic
containers. As night turned into a hot, sunny day in the devastated region, patients filled up parking lots,
sidewalks and roads outside hospitals. Angry relatives ransacked pharmacies for desperately needed
supplies.
"My house collapsed on me," said 40-year-old salesman Ozhan Zeyrek, his skin coated with gritty concrete
dust. "They dug me out after eight hours. I thought I had died and come back to life." He was limping down a
street, naked except for a curtain hitched round his waist like a skirt. He held out a swollen right forearm with
a grisly open wound. "Take me to a hospital. But not the one back there . . . All they could do was give me a
couple of injections."
In Istanbul, gold, bond, and stock markets closed when the Central Bank fund transfer computer went down.
The markets are expected to reopen for business today.
Rescue efforts were hampered by roads blocked in one direction by fleeing survivors, and in the other by
relatives searching for family members. And a damaged bridge cut the main Trans-Europe Motorway.

Turkey also lacks sophisticated rescue services. The U.S., Germany, Britain, Israel, Switzerland, Japan and
even Turkey's rival Greece prepared and sent trained teams to look for survivors. The Turks had little but
pickaxes, heavy construction equipment and their bare hands.
Lack of electric power, due to heavy damage to transmission lines and transformer stations, was a major
problem. Factories all shut, as did many other businesses in northwestern Turkey. The mayor of Izmit begged
on live television for foreign help to extinguish fires in the Tupras refinery, which he said was abandoned at
nightfall as the fires spread through naphtha tanks. The complex accounts for a third of Turkey's refining
capacity.
The shock to the area, mostly Kocaeli province around Izmit, will jolt Turkey at a delicate time for its
economy. The province generates 10% of Turkey's industrial production. Many foreign joint-venture factories
and car plants have chosen sites there. Its automotive industry helped production figures improve after the
economy shrank 8.4% in the first quarter of 1999.
Still, bankers believe the personal tragedies of the earthquake won't be matched by an economic meltdown.
"Our preliminary assessment is that the economic impact would be mildly negative on industrial production
and on the fiscal situation, but should not affect the chances of Turkey getting International Monetary Fund
funding in the fourth quarter of this year, or Turkey's progress toward stabilization," said a report from Laura
Papi of Deutsche Bank.

Cyclical and Growth Stocks Rally in Europe;Asian Markets, Led by Malaysia, Bounce Back

Cyclical and Growth Stocks Rally in Europe; Asian Markets, Led by Malaysia, Bounce Back

European shares enjoyed a broad rally that encompassed both cyclical and growth stocks, an odd
phenomenon that investors quipped was nearly as rare as the solar eclipse spotted this week across the
Continent.
Markets in Germany, France and the U.K. posted gains of more than 2%, as a few surprisingly strong
earnings reports and falling European bond yields lifted stocks in the financial and technology sectors. Oil,
metals and mining shares also rose.
Asian markets, meanwhile, bounced back strongly on the heels of Wall Street's rally Wednesday. Malaysian
stocks, up 5.9%, were the biggest winners after the country was reinstated in a popular global index. Overall,
the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.57, or 0.74%, to 213.73. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 2.81, or
1.81%, to 157.75.
European investors said they were pleasantly surprised to see both cyclical stocks and growth stocks, whose
prices tend to move in the opposite direction, chalk up strong gains. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592
European companies gained 2%.
"The market seems to be of two minds," said Bill Smyth, European equity strategist for Henderson Investors
in London. "Cyclicals on the whole are performing well, but some of the growth-stock prices are at least
showing signs of flattening out, if not rising."
The dual nature, he added, reflects the presumed shift in world economic growth as Europe appears to be
gradually gaining strength and the U.S. shows early signs of cooling off. The question is: Will the U.S.
economy still be up sharply by the time Europe has clearly rebounded?
Those who foresee strong global economic expansion as the U.S. and Europe both advance are loading up
on cyclical stocks such as metals and commodities, which was apparent yesterday. The basic resources
sector of the Dow Jones Stoxx Index was the best performer, up 4.2%.
"People are still not overweight on cyclicals," said David Bowers, European equity strategist for Merrill Lynch
in London. "They've only come up to a normal weighting. I see more buying to come as bond yields go
higher."
Most notably, British mining group Billiton soared 13% to 302.75 pence on speculation that Anglo American
Gold may be preparing a takeover bid. Anglo American climbed 173 pence to 37.71.
France's Pechiney also rose 8.6% to 58.50 euros, one day after the announcement of its three-way merger
plan with Canada's Alcan and Switzerland's Algroup.
At the same time, fund managers who believe the U.S. economy is slowing and that interest rates won't
have to climb much higher are picking up banks, financials and technology stocks. The
second-best-performing sector of the Stoxx Index yesterday was technology, which rose 2.9%. Shares of
Getronics, a Dutch technology services company, were buoyed 8.5% to 41.50 euros after reporting a 57%
rise in first-half profit.
Insurance companies also were standouts, aided by falling bond yields, especially the return of Germany's
10-year government bond yield to below 5%, a psychologically important level. These companies are heavily
invested in bonds, so their net assets rise and cost of capital falls when bond yields decline.

Shares of Dutch insurance group Aegon jumped 3% to 79.3 euros. The company reported
better-than-expected first-half profit of 679 million euros and announced it will buy the U.K. life-insurance
operation of Guardian Royal Exchange from Sun Life & Provincial Holdings.
Still, some investors don't expect such a broadly based rally in European stocks to reappear too frequently. "I
don't think it's sustainable for both growth and cyclical shares to continue upward," said James Clunie,
portfolio manager for Murray Johnstone International in Glasgow.
In other markets:
In TOKYO, the Nikkei 225 Index rose 211.81 points, or 1.2%, to 17422.97, gaining for the fourth consecutive
day. Honda Motor gained 170 yen to 4,980 yen after the auto maker reported better-than-expected fiscal
first-quarter results. A rally in U.S. technology shares Wednesday also boosted Japanese electronics
companies. Sony jumped 260 yen to 14,390 yen, while Fujitsu shares gained 80 yen to 3,230 yen.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index rebounded to close up 341.95, or 2.7%, at 12779.75, shaking off five
straight days of losses. Swire Pacific leapt 5% to 35.60 Hong Kong dollars after reporting its mid-year results.
The group posted a 9.4% decline in net profit to HK$1.82 billion, but analysts say investors are now betting
on a strong second half for the conglomerate. Cathay Pacific rose 4.1% to HK$11.55 after it reported
better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday.
China-related shares also rose sharply as positive China export figures for July, released Wednesday, eased
concerns about a possible currency devaluation. Citic Pacific, which has been under strong pressure in the
past few weeks, shot up 8% to HK$20.15.
In KUALA LUMPUR, the Composite Index soared 40.46, or 5.9%, to 728.96. Stocks gained on word that
Morgan Stanley Capital International was about to reinstate the country in its Emerging Markets Free Index.
After the market's close, the firm confirmed Malaysia is slated to rejoin the index starting in February.
Separately, senior financial executives close to the government said Kuala Lumpur is expected to reduce a
10% exit tax on profit from portfolio investments that were made after Feb. 15. A 10% levy on principal
investments is already scheduled to end Sept. 1. The market's biggest winner yesterday was casino operator
Resorts World, which gained 23% to 1.60 ringgit.
In SAO PAULO, the Bovespa Index fell 91, or 0.9%, to 10,045. Preferred shares of local aircraft manufacturer
Embraer jumped 9.9% to 5.43 real on talk the company could soon sell a minority stake and carry out an
American depositary receipt issue by October. Officials have denied that either move is imminent.

NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks tumbled in active trading, although the group's losses, as
measured by the Russell 2000 index, were slimmer than those of the broader stock market.
The overall Nasdaq market was solidly lower, but both the small-cap and Nasdaq markets managed to pare
their intraday losses with the help of a late-day burst of buying activity.
As has been the case for the past few weeks, the small-cap and Nasdaq markets were weighed down by the
weakness of technology stocks, although Internet stocks rebounded.
The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 3.07, or 0.72%, to 422.82, and the Nasdaq
Composite Index, at 2490.11, tumbled 28.87, or 1.15%.
Zonagen, a Woodlands, Texas, biopharmaceutical concern, plummeted 2 3/8, or 32.5%, to a 52-week low of
4 15/16. The Food and Drug Administration put on hold all clinical trials of the active ingredient in Zonagen's
erectile-dysfunction therapy, Vasomax. The trials were put on hold until the company can evaluate whether
abnormalities found in a two-year study of rats could occur in humans. If approved, Vasomax would compete
with Pfizer's blockbuster impotence drug, Viagra. Zonagen said it can provide sufficient information to the
FDA to remove the clinical hold.
Gerber Childrenswear (NYSE) dove 2 7/16, or 32.5%, to a 52-week low of 5 1/16. The Greenville, S.C.,
manufacturer of infant and toddler clothing and related products late Monday posted second-quarter earnings
that fell significantly shy of analysts' projections. Yesterday, Merrill Lynch lowered its near-term rating on the
stock to neutral from accumulate and cut its longterm rating to accumulate from buy.
Paging Network tumbled 13/16, or 19.1%, to 3 7/16. The Dallas wireless-messaging and information-services
provider reported a second-quarter loss of 92 cents a share, compared with analysts' projections of a 38-cent
loss. The company also said third-quarter results will be hurt by conversions and systems reconciliation, as
well as by about 50,000 cancellations from a national account relationship and about 70,000 cancellations
from the bankruptcy of a reseller.
Razorfish slid 3 1/4, or 11.5%, to a 52-week low of 25 following news the New York provider of digital
communications services agreed to acquire i-Cube for $677 million in stock. Razorfish said it expects the
acquisition will add to its earnings in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000.
Union Bankshares surged 4 5/8, or 37%, to a 52-week high of 17 1/8 after the Denver bank-holding company
agreed to be acquired by Gold Banc for $23.05 a share in stock.
Biocryst Pharmaceuticals leapt 3 15/16, or 26.4%, to a 52-week high of 18 7/8. Salomon Smith Barney raised
its price target on the Birmingham, Ala., developer of small-molecule pharmaceuticals to $25 from $12.50.
The firm based its move on the favorable outlook for Biocryst's flu treatment, which is being developed by
Johnson & Johnson.
Copley Pharmaceutical jumped 1 15/16, or 21.8%, to 10 13/16 after the Canton, Mass., maker of prescription
and over-the -- counter drugs agreed to be acquired by Israeli drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for
$11 a share.
New York Stock Exchange-traded Medicis Pharmaceutical climbed 3 1/8, or 13.6%, to 26 1/16. Hambrecht &
Quist added the Phoenix marketer of skin products and prescription skin lotions to its focus list.

NYSE-traded Lodgian gained 7/16, or 9.6%, to 5 after the West Palm Beach, Fla., hotel operator reported
second-quarter earnings of 32 cents a share, compared with its 29-cent year-ago profit. The results were in
line with analysts' projections.
Remedy added 1 13/16, or 9.2%, to 21 7/16. Banc of America Securities raised its rating on the
Mountainview, Calif., software concern to strong buy from buy.
NYSE-traded Comstock Resources was up 3/8, or 7.1%, to 5 5/8. The Dallas energy company posted a
second-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts had been expecting.
Asahi/America, a Malden, Mass., maker of thermoplastic valves, pipe, piping systems and components,
rallied for a gain of 1/2, or 6.3%, to 8 3/8 after agreeing to be acquired by Midnight Acquisition Holdings, a
unit of Asahi Organic Chemicals Industry, for about $9.50 a share.
On the Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers, 2,611 to 1,317, on national market volume of 946 million
shares and overall volume of 978 million, compared with 717 million and 748 million, respectively, Monday.
Several times during the selloff of the past few weeks, there were signs that the retreat had run its course,
such as yesterday's late-day rebound.
But so far, those signals have been misleading.
"At best, we're only two-thirds of the way through this drop," said Greg Kuhn of Kuhn Asset Management. Mr.
Kuhn expects the Nasdaq composite will fall more than 20% from its July 16 record close before it hits
bottom.
A key reason Mr. Kuhn sees further declines is his perception that the market is unusually illiquid. He said
short interest is very low compared with the levels of the past two years, and the level of cash in mutual funds
is at one of the lowest points since the 1970s.
"There are no bids," he said, largely because "the money's been spent."
Mr. Kuhn said the money that came out of the stock market during last summer's selloff has already been
re-invested, and that with the Federal Reserve having reversed course by raising interest rates, with another
rate increase widely anticipated, that money "is leaving again."
While Mr. Kuhn expects the stock market will continue to move lower, he said the relative performance of
small-cap stocks compared with large caps "will be the flip of last summer," when small-cap stocks posted
much sharper declines than the overall Nasdaq market and the other major indexes.
As the overall stock market moves lower, "we'll see large stocks fall more than small caps," he said. "Small
caps won't do as poorly on the down side."

IMF Rethinks PlansTo Sell Gold ReservesTo Help Relieve Debt
IMF Rethinks Plans To Sell Gold Reserves To Help Relieve Debt

PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund is reconsidering plans to sell some of its
gold reserves to help finance a Western debt-relief plan for some of the world's most debt-burdened
countries, a top IMF official said yesterday.
Gold prices have plunged to 20-year lows on the prospect of a global gold sell-off, which was hastened by
the Bank of England's auction of 3.5% of its reserves last month.
Gold's loss of luster has triggered bankruptcies, layoffs and street protests in South Africa, the world's
biggest producer of gold. And tens of thousands of miners there stand to lose their jobs if gold prices
continue sliding.
"We are trying very hard to see if there is an alternative to selling gold," said Stanley Fischer, the IMF's first
deputy managing director, who was visiting South Africa for the inauguration of Tito Mboweni, the country's
first black central-bank governor.
Mr. Fischer's remarks, reported by Dow Jones Newswires, were the first official comment from the IMF since
criticism of the proposed sale began mounting three months ago.
Opposition by South Africa and by other gold-producing countries to the IMF plan to sell as many as 10
million ounces of its 100 million-ounce reserves has "caused us to look for another solution," Mr. Fischer said.
South Africa has one of the highest average costs of production, at $246 an ounce. Yesterday, gold for
current delivery closed at $257.50 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a gain of 40 cents.
Gold peaked at $875 a troy ounce in New York in January 1980.
