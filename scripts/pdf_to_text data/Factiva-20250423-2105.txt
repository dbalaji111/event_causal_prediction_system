Corrections & Amplifications
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index had risen for five consecutive
months as of November. A Monday Year-End Review of Markets & Finance article incorrectly said the index
had risen six straight months.
(WSJ January 6, 2011)
Corrections & Amplifications
Crude-oil futures settled at a two-year high of $89.38 a barrel on Dec. 6, 2010. An article in the Year-End
Review of Markets & Finance said the Dec. 6 settlement was $91.51, which was a later peak, hit on Dec. 23.
(WSJ March 30, 2011)
(END)
The stock market still is trying to claw back to its peak before the financial crisis, and housing prices may not
yet have bottomed. Some commodities, however, already cost significantly more than they did before the
bubble burst just over two years ago, and many others are rising fast.
In a measure of how powerful the raw-materials rally has been, copper and gold are at all-time highs, while
cotton and sugar are pricier than in mid-2008. And oil, while down from its peak of $145 a barrel from July
2008, is still pricier than in September 2007, a year before Lehman Brothers collapsed.
The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, which tracks 19 commodities, rose 16.8% in 2010, after climbing
19% in 2009. It remains 11% below its level at the end of 2007, but sub-indexes for metals and agriculture
were both up during the past year, while energy was down.
The broad commodities rally has been propelled largely by demand from China and other rapidly growing
nations, which have also bounced back quickly from the economic slowdown and are straining the ability of
the world's drillers, miners and farmers to meet their needs.
But commodities also are drawing record-setting interest from hedge funds, pension funds and other
institutional investors eager to profit from the run-up. Such investors were expected to have poured $60 billion
into the commodities markets in 2010, the second largest inflow after $76 billion in 2009, according to
Barclays Capital.
The flood of cash is raising concerns about potential consequences if investor sentiment turns away from
commodities, perhaps if the Federal Reserve signals an intent to raise interest rates after years of
extraordinarily loose monetary policy.
"When will this money leave the commodity space? That's the billion-dollar question, and nobody knows
exactly," Bob Takai, general manager of financial services at Sumitomo Corp., said in an email. "But
everyone knows it will be very ugly."
For now, however, demand is strong and investors eager, and the results were clearly visible across the
commodity markets in 2010.
Metals
In 2010, investors were in the driver's seat for precious metals.

--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
From multibillion-dollar hedge funds to ordinary individuals, investors piled into exchange-traded funds and
futures contracts linked to gold and its shiny brethren.
Concerns about economic instability in the West and the risk of inflation in China and other developing
nations sent investors fleeing for perceived safe havens, benefiting the group.
Gold ended the year at a record of $1421.10 per ounce, up 29.8%. Last year not only marked the yellow
metal's 10th straight up year, but was also its best-performing year in dollar terms in history.
"This is the first time for many years that investors have been as influential as they have," said James Steel, a
precious-metals analyst at HSBC Bank USA. "Without the increased investor demand, it wouldn't take the
market to these levels."
Platinum and palladium, used in car parts, also jumped last year on the back of a recovery of the world's
automobile industry.
Palladium soared 97.3%, as it is heavily used in gasoline-fueled engines common in Asia and North America,
regions that saw the fastest growth in auto production. Mr. Steel is expecting a 200,000-ounce palladium
deficit in 2011, which would be the first deficit in decades.
Higher emissions standards for farm equipment and other off-road equipment, meanwhile, are pushing up
platinum demand at a time of tight supplies, Dwight Anderson, managing partner at Ospraie Management
LLC, a commodities-focused hedge fund, said at a conference this fall. Platinum rose 21.5% in 2010.
But of all the precious metals, silver's surge came as a big surprise, gaining 83.8% to $30.91 a troy ounce.
"People like farmers and bond investors who had remained with safe assets have started to allocate to metals
like silver," said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock.
The silver market's relatively small market size -- $19 billion, compared with $170 billion for gold -- means
prices are "very highly geared to growth in investor inflows," GFMS said. The largest silver ETF -- BlackRock
Inc.'s $10 billion iShares Silver Trust -- saw an inflow of $1.1 billion during the first 11 months of 2010.
Among base metals, meanwhile, copper remains the favorite industrial metal among a number of analysts.
Strong demand from emerging countries, along with a continuous decline of inventories, pushed copper
prices up by 33.4% to $4.4395 a pound, a record.
Agriculture
In mid-spring, placid markets for many major agricultural commodities suggested steady supply and
manageable demand. By summer's end, that balance was gone.
In its place came a series of dramatic price spikes, many spurred by supply constraints of key food crops,
which reignited global concerns about potential shortages to meet some of humanity's most basic needs.
A drought in Russia sent wheat prices soaring, and corn and soybeans followed, reviving memories of the
2008 rally that preceded the financial crisis. By year-end, corn prices were up 93.5% from June lows, and
ended the year up 51.8%. Wheat and soybeans gained 46.7% and 34.1%, respectively, on the year.
Other crops leapt, too. Flooding in Pakistan cut the cotton harvest while Chinese imports soared, sending
prices higher than they had been in more than a century. Coffee shot up 76.9% in 2010, while sugar rose
19.2%.
"We've got a more broad-based rally," said Bill Cordingley, a food and agribusiness analyst at Rabobank, a
major agricultural lender.
The rally has investors and policy makers paying close attention to developments that could propel prices
higher still in 2011. Dry weather in South America could threaten the size of that harvest, and there are
lingering concerns about how much wheat drought-racked Russia will produce next year.
In the U.S., meanwhile, farmers are making key decisions in the coming weeks about what they can plant
most profitably, putting a spotlight on estimates of how many acres nationwide will be dedicated to each crop.
In November, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index rose for the sixth
straight month, putting it just below the peak it hit in June 2008.
No wonder few are predicting agricultural markets will soon return to widespread calm.
Energy

For most of the past year, the oil market -- the biggest of the commodities by market value -- was a dull place.
Robust demand from emerging countries was tempered by record-high stockpiles in developed nations.
Larger economic forces were the main driver for prices, and oil and stocks were unusually tightly correlated.
Prices stayed in a narrow band between $68 and $92 a barrel. Oil ended the year up 15.2% at $91.38 a
barrel.
But the relationship began to break down toward year-end, as oil inventories were whittled down by a global
manufacturing recovery and prices reached a two-year high on Dec. 6, at $91.51.
Global oil demand was on track to hit an all-time high in 2010, growing 2.9% to 87.45 million barrels a day,
according to the International Energy Agency. The agency forecast a further expansion in 2011, although at a
slower pace, to 88.77 million barrels a day.
On the supply side, meanwhile, many oil producers had curtailed their capital spending during the course of
financial crisis, and it usually takes years for new fields to start pumping oil.
Globally, the depletion rate for oil production -- or annual production divided by oil reserves -- is about 8%,
said Kurt Hallead, co-head of global energy research with RBC Capital Markets. "The challenge for the
industry is to continue to replace what's being depleted and produce enough on top of that to meet the
long-term projected demand," he said.
The supply-demand dynamic is leading some to predict a strong rally. Morgan Stanley analysts predicted
recently that crude oil would go "above $100 per barrel" in 2011, in a recent note.
Natural gas, by contrast, was among the worst-performing commodities in 2010, down 20.9% for the year.
Prices were weighed down by continuing growth of unconventional shale gas in North America, and still-weak
demand.
Analysts expect the gas market to struggle further in 2011. Though the surplus may ease, the U.S. will still
produce 200 million cubic feet per day more than it consumes, Mr. Hallead said.
"Most people in the industry are now of the view that long-term gas prices will probably be in the band from
$4 to $6" per million British thermal units, said Frank Murphy, managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. At
year's end, those prices were $4.405.

Bumpy Climb for Stocks --- Investors Endured a Year of Wobbles and Worries, but Market Rewarded Them
Bumpy Climb for Stocks --- Investors Endured a Year of Wobbles and Worries, but Market Rewarded
Them

Stocks turned in another solid year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining nearly 11% and the Nasdaq
doing better still. Yet for much of 2010, it didn't feel like a winning year.
Amid stumbles and scares, U.S. stocks clambered to a second straight year of gains, in which the Dow
reached levels not seen since the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
"It was a pretty hard-earned 11%," said Jeffrey Palma, global equity strategist for UBS Investment Research.
"It was like a roller coaster -- certainly nothing like a straight line."
With one day of trading left in the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 1,141.66 points, or
10.9%, and stands at 11569.71.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has added 142.78 points, or 12.8%, to 1257.88. The Nasdaq
Composite index has risen 393.83 points, or 17.4%, to 2662.98.
There was hopeful economic news Thursday, as initial claims for unemployment fell to the lowest level in over
two years. An index of pending home sales rose 3.5% for November.
The second half of the year was responsible for nearly all of the 2010 stock gains. Since hitting a closing low
on July 2, the Dow has advanced 19.4%. On Thursday, the Dow slipped 15.67 points, or 0.1%.
There were several noted areas of out-performance. Small caps, as measured by the Russell 2000 index,
jumped 26%. Real estate investment trusts also rose, with the Dow Jones Equity All REIT index surging
23.2%. Tech favorites Apple, Netflix and F5 Networks catapulted up by 53.6%, 226.4% and 150%
respectively.
Industrial behemoth Caterpillar, with its ties to commodities and emerging markets, notched a 64.7% gain,
making it the best-performing Dow component. And Ford, which more than quadrupled in 2009, continued to
rise, posting a gain of 66.9% amid optimism about the economic recovery.
Going into 2010, investors had reason to be skeptical. Stinging losses from the financial crisis were still fresh.
And after 2009's 23.5% gain for the S&P, the lion's share of gains appeared to many to be over. In the spring,
markets fell as the European debt crisis flared out of Greece, chatter about Chinese monetary tightening
grew, and U.S. economic data came in weak.
Then a technical snafu in the afternoon of May 6 sent U.S. markets careening. At its afternoon low, the Dow
plummeted 998.50 points, its biggest intraday point drop ever, before quickly reversing course. Several
stocks inexplicably fell to one cent a share. What came to be known as the "flash crash" rattled confidence
and turned a harsh spotlight on the growing influence of algorithmic and high-frequency traders.
Stock investors looked ready throw in the towel. On July 2, the Dow tumbled to a close of 9686.48, some
13.6% below its April 26 high. Investors began to move to the safety of U.S. Treasurys, pushing the price of
bonds up and their yields down. Some wondered if the bond market was starting to price in the possibility of
deflation.
That was a risk the Federal Reserve wasn't willing to take. On Aug. 27, Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted in a
speech at a Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that the Fed could launch a second round of the
bond-buying known as "quantitative easing" to bring down interest rates.
The speech marked a turning point. Emboldened first by the Fed and later by improving economic data,
investments entailing more risk soared.

Agricultural commodities, a traditionally volatile sector, saw unusually extreme price swings. Coffee prices hit
a 13-year high this week after a spate of adverse weather, and are up 73.8% on the year. Sugar hit 30-year
highs this week before collapsing again. Summer wildfires in Russia and a ban on that country's wheat
exports sent wheat prices up by 45% in the third quarter alone. Cotton hit a 140-year high in December -- not
adjusted for inflation -- while corn and soybeans rose 48.6% and 31.4% respectively this year.
Concern about an activist Fed and a feeble dollar fueled demand for inflation hedges. Gold charged above
$1,400 in early November. The excitement extended to silver, which during the last four months of the year
surged higher, hitting a series of 30-year highs, before inflation. It's up 81% on the year. Copper, long
considered a bellwether of economic activity because of its use in many applications, hit new highs in
December.
Commodities and materials stocks jumped too. The industrials, materials and energy sectors were among the
best-performing of the S&P 500 through Thursday's close, up 23.8%, 19.8% and 17.9% respectively.
The consumer discretionary sectors rose 26% as Americans showed signs of shaking off the worst effects of
the financial crisis. The S&P consumer sector was buoyed by stocks such as Wynn Resorts and Abercrombie
& Fitch, which rose 74.7% and 66.7% respectively.
At the same time, the relative weakness of technology stocks was another surprise. Many market watchers
had predicted tech would rise on spending by efficiency-minded corporations.
Some of the sluggishness could be attributed to stumbles by a few tech giants. In August, the abrupt
departure of Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Mark Hurd knocked the company's shares down 8%, while a
weak sales projection in November from Cisco sent that bellwether stock tumbling 16%. H-P and Cisco are
set to finish the year down 18% and 15.5% respectively.
While tech as a whole didn't live up to expectations, some of the biggest growth stories came from that
sector. Excitement over cloud computing boosted F5 Networks. NetFlix rode a wave of goodwill to more than
triple in value. Apple surged after scoring a hit with its iPad. Online retailer Amazon.com and International
Business Machines also climbed to all-time highs.
On the losing end, for-profit education company Apollo Group finished the year through Dec. 30 down 34.5%,
on the prospect of more government regulation.
Natural gas prices also took a beating, falling 22% through Thursday's close, as production from
unconventional shale-gas formations and weak demand contributed to a glut.
Municipal bonds were battered as Treasury yields rose, uncertainty about government policy grew and worry
about the fiscal position of state and local governments became more pronounced.

When Money Dies: The Nightmare of Deficit Spending, Devaluation and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany
By Adam Fergusson
(PublicAffairs, 228 pages, $14.95)
It says something about present anxieties that a 35-year-old account of Weimar hyperinflation has come into
vogue. In early 2010, Adam Fergusson's long-out-of-print volume was trading online for four-figure sums.
There were (false) reports of kind words about it from Warren Buffett. Now back in print, this once obscure
book from 1975 has been selling briskly. Just another manifestation of the financial millenarianism now
sweeping the land? Perhaps, but "When Money Dies" remains a fascinating and disturbing book.
The death of the German mark (it took 20 of them to buy a British pound in 1914 but 310 billion in late 1923)
plays a key part in the dark iconography of the 20th century: Images of kindling currency and economic chaos
are an essential element in our understanding of the rise of Hitler. Mr. Fergusson adds valuable nuance to a
familiar story. His tale begins not, as would be popularly assumed, in the aftermath of Germany's political and
military collapse in 1918 (by which point the mark had halved against the pound) but in the original decision to
fund the war effort largely through debt -- a decision with uncomfortable contemporary parallels (one of many
in this book) tailor-made for today's end-timers.
Yet the parallels go only so far. The almost inevitably inflationary consequences of paying for a world war on
credit were exacerbated by: Germany's relatively shallow capital markets, the creation of "loan banks" funded
solely by a printing press that was also at the disposal of the central bank; and the muffling of warning
signals in a way unimaginable in our information age. The rise in prices was obvious to all. That it was due to
more than wartime shortages was not. The country's stock markets were closed for the duration of the
fighting. Foreign-exchange rates were not published.
And then there were the black swans. Early 20th-century Germany was savaged by a flock, including defeat
in what was then the world's most destructive war, revolution, civil unrest, territorial loss, the imposition of
punitive reparations, a fresh occupation of its industrial heartland and, as if these woes were not enough, a
Reichsbank presided over by Rudolf Havenstein. Even in the era of Zimbabwe's Gideon Gono, Havenstein
must be considered a strong contender for the title of worst central banker of all time. There seemed to be no
limit to the amount of currency he was willing to print. Yes, America has its problems today, but by
comparison . . .
"When Money Dies" was written in the early 1970s for a British audience. Inflation was accelerating fast, and
London's political class was at a loss about what to do. Mr. Fergusson's book (which began as a series of
newspaper articles) reflected the growing national alarm over inflation and hinted that price stability would
not be won back without more focus on the quantity of money in circulation. With monetarist ideas just
beginning to enter mainstream British political discourse, the Havenstein of "When Money Dies" -- a
printing-press banker supposedly unaware of the connection between soaring inflation and roaring money
supply -- made a useful villain.
Yet in all probability his behavior owed as much to desperation as ignorance. Mass unemployment seemed
more of a threat to Weimar's dangerously fragile social order than rising prices. Devaluation was the other
side of Germany's debased coin. It kept the country's exports competitive and its factories (given an extra
boost by generous subsidy regimes) humming.
But in the end the music stopped. Without a reliable pricing mechanism, much of the German economy
eventually ceased to function, even at the most basic level. Rent was payable in butter, a ticket to the movies
with a lump of coal. Farmers stopped sending food to the cities. Under such circumstances the harsh

medicine of monetary reform (the return to a fixed parity against gold and the dollar, the imposition of strict
budgetary discipline) found the political support it needed despite the pain it was bound to bring to German
industry and its work force.
And so, in November 1923, a new quasi-currency, the Rentenmark, was launched. Its asset backing was little
more than a conjuring trick, but with the population desperate to believe (and with the Reichsbank no longer
financing the government) the magic worked. Despite the rickety nature of the recovery that eventually
ensued, Germany might have arrived at a lasting turning point had not black swans -- the Great Crash and a
global depression -- returned to bedevil its future once again.
Readers of Mr. Fergusson's melancholy chronicle can comfort themselves with the thought: That was then,
and this is now. "When Money Dies" cannot be used to prove that the combination of rising deficits and the
modern money manufacture euphemized as "Quantitative Easing" can only end up in near-apocalyptic
disaster. (In a note to this new edition, Mr. Fergusson, who subsequently became a Conservative member of
the European Parliament in the early Thatcher years, stresses that no "advanced economy is threatened with
inflation approaching such severity as in post-Imperial Germany.") Nevertheless, to borrow his adjective, the
book is a "sobering" warning of what could go wrong.
His examination of both the seductions of inflation and its devastatingly corrosive effect is merciless and
horrifying. Most haunting are the depictions of those broken on inflation's wheel, the workers without a union
to protect them, the retired trying to live on pensions that had lost all meaning, the once-proud bourgeois after
the annihilation of their savings. A nation can recover from hyperinflation, but for these people time had run
out. Every body ought to read this book. But baby boomers must.

China's Real-Estate Frenzy
China's Real-Estate Frenzy
By Hugo Restall

Hong Kong -- Last week I sold an apartment in Beijing for more than 2.5 times what I paid for it five years and
three months ago. When I asked the buyer why he was optimistic about real estate, he explained that land
was limited in Chinese cities and government policies would keep the market going up.
So far that argument has proven right. Understanding government policy has long been the key to making
money in China's property and stock markets. The atmosphere at the Beijing tax and land bureaus brought to
mind California during the gold rush.
It's impossible to say definitively that a market has strayed into bubble territory until after the collapse. But
prices rising out of the reach of average buyers is one indicator. Housing prices in the U.S. peaked at 6.4
times average earnings this decade. In Beijing, the figure is 22 times.
If the froth is confined to housing, as it was more or less in the U.S., China can muddle through. But it is not.
Consider the problem of leverage.
Those who doubt that Chinese housing is in a bubble often point to the lack of leverage. And it's true that on
paper Chinese banks only lend a prudent amount to buyers, so that if the market falls by a third, they will still
be "above water."
Many buyers, such as the one who bought my apartment, pay in cash. Even given the probability that banks
sometimes break the rules, it's clear that leverage as traditionally understood doesn't drive Chinese home
sales. But there is still plenty to be worried about, because the leverage comes from elsewhere.
Real estate is just the preferred way to store wealth. There are no property taxes, so an empty apartment
doesn't cost a lot to maintain. Registered in the name of a family member, it also doesn't attract a lot of
attention from the authorities who try to track down income, not all of it legal, that is not reported for tax
purposes.
The wealth itself comes from the credit machine that drives China's investment-led economy. Fixed-asset
investment grew 23.5% this year, and it is forecast to grow 20% next year. After 2008, Beijing paid lip service
to the need to rebalance the economy in favor of consumption instead of investment. Meanwhile it doubled
down on investment, with a stimulus package for 2009, equivalent to 15% of GDP, that was made up mostly
of bank loans. The torrid pace of lending continued this year.
Pushing loans out the door throws off large amounts of cash to the managers and cadres involved, which
they then use to buy apartments. For instance, local governments depend on the revenue from land
redevelopment, and the officials then take a cut and buy property. As long as the music keeps playing,
everyone keeps dancing.
In the past, when China could depend on growing export markets, technocrats in Beijing were able to keep
speculative frenzies in check with periodic crackdowns. Moreover, with ample supplies of cheap labor, the
real economy was unlikely to overheat. The main tools to regulate growth were administrative: government
orders to banks to stop lending and to companies and local governments to halt projects. And that's what
Beijing is still trying, increasing banks' reserve ratios and cutting lending quotas.
But this time nobody is listening. Local governments and banks have set up off-balance sheet vehicles to
conceal loans and keep the spending boom going. Fitch Ratings estimates that not only did banks exceed the
central bank's 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) cap on lending for this year, they made an additional three trillion
yuan of these shadow loans.
When a government loses control of monetary policy, inflation follows. A few months ago, only the scariest
"China bears" predicted 6% inflation for next year; now the People's Daily is admitting it may reach those
levels "in some months."

The nonindependent People's Bank of China, staffed by reform-oriented technocrats, is being allowed to
raise interest rates a few basis points. But allocating credit on the basis of its cost threatens the whole
political economy. The state-owned companies have become accustomed to negative real interest rates. If
the price of capital rises, many of the Communist Party elite will face a crunch.
China's real-estate game could have longer to run. Due to the high savings rate, banks are liquid and the
national debt is relatively small. Beijing could double down again on investment and weather the inflation for
another year perhaps.
But it's not a good idea. Most of the Chinese economy operates on the basis of price signals, yet the
government continues to regulate it as if it were still planned. The longer Beijing waits to start using interest
rates to run monetary policy, the bigger the bubble will get. And the bigger the reckoning when it ends.

The Fed's Dual Mandate Is Not the Problem
The Fed's Dual Mandate Is Not the Problem
By Marc Sumerlin

Greatly concerned about the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing program, many conservative members of
Congress are actively talking about changing the central bank's dual legal mandate -- keeping its mission to
promote price stability but removing its requirement to promote maximum employment. With a single
purpose, price stability, the thinking goes, the Fed will stop trying to tinker with employment and shift back to
a sound-money policy.
Unfortunately, that plan would not have prevented the stock market or housing bubbles of the last decade
and a half. And it would actually be supportive of the Fed's current program.
Recent history provides ample room for criticism of the Federal Reserve, but none of it is due to its
employment mandate. Take first the Fed's complicity in the late 1990s bubble. From January 1995 to May
1999, it reduced interest rates to 4.75% from 6% even as real growth averaged 4% and the Nasdaq climbed
from 750 to 2500.
What gave the Fed comfort to reduce rates during the biggest boom in U.S. history? Falling inflation. By its
preferred measure -- changes in the prices of personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy
(core PCE) -- inflation dipped to under 1.5% from 2.5%. The central bank did finally raise interest rates in
June 1999. Yet if the Fed only had an employment mandate it would have started to raise interest rates a
full two years earlier, in May 1997, when the unemployment rate dipped below 5%.
Consider also the housing bubble from 2003 to 2007. In 2003, the Fed highlighted the risk of an "unwelcome
substantial fall in inflation" as the justification for lowering the fed-funds rate to 1%. Then it kept monetary
policy accommodative until the summer of 2006, when it finally reached a neutral stance. This was three
years after the unemployment rate had started to decline to 4.6% from 6.3%.
In fairness, neither part of the Fed's "dual mandate" gave it any sense of great urgency. Inflation never got
above 2.5% before the onset of the 2008 recession, and the unemployment rate didn't signal a need to
tighten until the end of 2005, when it fell below 5%. Clearly the central bank was missing something during
both episodes. It paid insufficient attention to balance-sheet measures like the rise in liabilities and asset
prices, both of which clearly signaled that monetary policy was too loose.
Between 1995 and 2000, the ratio of household net worth to disposable income surged 33%. This measure is
roughly akin to a price-earnings ratio for the entire country, and it had never experienced such a move.
Money was clearly going into the stock market, even if not into the prices of goods and services that central
banks typically focus on. The entire rise in wealth was undone during the subsequent stock-market crash.
Then all of the gains to wealth were recreated between 2002 and 2006 as housing prices boomed.
Wealth-to-income ratios were not the only red alert being triggered. Over the period that encompassed both
bubbles, the aggregate amount of credit in the economy rose steadily to more than 350% of GDP, from
225%. If the Fed had focused more on the growth of debt or asset prices instead of a narrow measure of
inflation, it would have followed a tighter monetary policy.
Given recent history, surely the Fed needs to consider these measures, and perhaps to broaden its view of
inflation to more actively include commodity prices, which have some track record of predicting inflation.
Gold has served as an alternative currency for 2,000 years, and copper is a useful indicator of global
production. Because these commodities are influenced by global economic forces, they cannot be the sole
guide to U.S. monetary policy. But they should not be ignored either.
While some clarification of its price-stability mandate might help, the central bank is already required to keep
credit growth in check. Its full legal mandate is as follows: "The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of monetary and credit

Page 15 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote
effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
Now consider current economic conditions. Housing prices have started to fall again and are dropping in 29
out of 30 leading cities. Aggregate credit is also dropping and will continue to contract as the nation finishes a
long period of deleveraging. Within this lens, it easier to understand why Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is still
pursuing accommodative policy.
But if you wanted the Fed to stop, a single mandate for price stability is the wrong tool to use. Inflation by the
Fed's preferred measure (the core PCE price index) is now below 1% and could be zero in a year's time --
well below the global consensus among central bankers that inflation should be about 2%. A myopic
price-stability mandate could actually lock the Federal Reserve into quantitative easing for years, given its
inflation target. This would be an odd result for a movement that is hoping to persuade the Fed to do less,
not more.
A better idea would be to broaden the Fed's mandate to fully examine the nation's balance sheet when
making policy decisions. Skilled central bankers look for clues everywhere. Policies that limit their search
make little sense in a complicated world.

Price of Silver Soaring --- Investor-Fueled 74% Gains Dwarf Gold; Race to Open Mines

BIG CREEK, Idaho -- An unexpected surge in investor demand is sending silver prices soaring -- and
speculators and mining companies are digging in.
In the past four months, the metal has upended forecasts, rising 51% to a series of 30-year highs, before
inflation. Silver closed Thursday at $29.31 a troy ounce, up from $16.822 at the beginning of 2010.
Among the four major precious metals -- the others being gold, platinum and palladium -- silver is up 74%
this year, on track to be the second-best performing commodity after palladium, which is up 86%. Gold, by
contrast, is up 26% and copper just under 28%.
Prices are rising despite oversupply and a lackluster recovery in industrial demand. Many analysts expected
those factors would keep a lid on prices in 2010. What they didn't expect was an overwhelming flow of money
into the market from investors eager to ride a commodities rally.
"This is a story almost entirely about investment," says Stephen Briggs, senior metals strategist at BNP
Paribas.
The global silver appetite partly reflects world economic improvements. Investors from the U.S. to China
turned to "hard" assets such as copper and other commodities in part as a hedge against inflation worries.
Silver benefits from a dual role as industrial commodity and precious metal.
Here in the mountain-ringed Silver Valley, historically one of the world's largest silver production regions,
workers are busy punching through rocks to open passages in the Crescent Silver Mine, which closed more
than a dozen years ago when prices of silver dipped to $5 to $6 an ounce.
Even if prices retreat to $15 an ounce -- a level seen as recently as early this year -- some prospectors say
they can break even, which means development will continue. "I think we are starting a new era in mining
here," says Greg Stewart, president of United Mining Group, which has an 80% interest in the Crescent Silver
Mine.
Exchange-traded funds backed with silver have enabled investors to invest in a market that traditionally was
harder to participate in. The largest silver ETF, the $10.2 billion iShares Silver Trust, has seen a $1.1 billion
net inflow for the first 11 months of this year. In recent months, concerns about inflation, the European debt
crisis and the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent moves to boost the economy have driven investors to hard
assets, also benefitting silver prices.
The craze has reached the coin market. In November, silver American Eagle coins sold by the U.S. Mint
amounted to 4.26 million ounces, a monthly record in the agency's history.
Silver's reliance on investors to prop up the price could cause it to tumble suddenly. "When investor support
for the metal fades, the downside is going to be pretty substantial," says Credit Suisse analyst Tom Kendall.
He forecasts an average price of $30.10 per troy ounce next year as "a lot of factors that have led people to
buy silver would still be there in 2011." But he cautions, "The number is only going to be achievable as long
as fresh money keeps moving in."
Silver's all-time high was set in January 1980 at $48.70 an ounce, or $129.32 when adjusted for inflation.
This year investors are expected to pile a record $4.5 billion into the silver market, accounting for 24% of the
world's total demand, says GFMS Ltd., a metals consulting firm in London. That's the highest level, in dollar
terms, in decades. Silver's relatively small market size -- $19 billion compared with $170 billion for gold -- has
also played a role in amplifying the impact of investors, according to GFMS.

--- Page 17 ---

The strength in silver prices has prompted a flurry of development around the globe and pushed anticipated
production in 2010 to 733.2 million ounces, up 3.3% from 2009 levels, and up 14% since 2006.
Silver has some inherent appeal due to its industrial use in electronics, silverware and coins. And reserves
are limited. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, there are fewer years of U.S. silver production left in the
ground than any other precious metal including gold.
The recent price increase has been fueled by other factors in addition to investor interest. For instance, China
recently abolished an exports tax rebate on metals. That has resulted in a 59% decline in silver exports.
China is a major silver producer and was a big exporter until 14 months ago. Strong demand there, coupled
with the elimination of the tax break to protect domestic natural resources, have led Chinese producers to
slash exports.
Concerns are lingering over excess supply. The market is set to see a surplus of 64.4 million ounces in 2010,
says Barclays Capital, which could curb prices. This year's surplus will be 16% smaller than 2009's but much
higher than previous years.
Overall, silver production has been rising steadily in the past five years, with most of the growth coming from
mines in Mexico, Latin America and Australia. Gold Corp., a Vancouver-based mining company, expects to
more than triple output at its mine in Mexico, Penasquito, which is expected to produce 10 million ounces of
silver in 2011, up from about 3 million ounces in 2009, according to GFMS.
Another new mine, Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation's Palmarejo silver and gold mine in Mexico, is also
ramping up to produce 9 million ounces annually. And BHP Billiton, which owns one of the largest silver
mines in the world, Cannington, is looking to increase production and extend the life of the mine, located in
Australia.
So-called junior miners like United Mining Group, which has an interest in the Crescent Silver Mine, are much
smaller than mining giants like BHP and Rio Tinto. They often lack the capital or expertise to run a mine,
which requires costly equipment and infrastructure. Instead, their geologists often scout projects and then sell
an interest in them to larger companies.
United Mining Group is issuing shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange to raise up to $8 million to develop the
Crescent Silver Mine, which is more than 90 years old.

World News: Behind Firm's Default: Vietnam's Growth Mania

HANOI -- State-owned shipbuilder Vinashin's default on a $600 million loan late last week is just the latest
crisis challenging Communist-run Vietnam's ability to get its economy under control after years of pell-mell
growth and spiraling inflation.
The company, officially named Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group, failed to make a $60 million initial
repayment on the syndicated loan to international lenders, saying it will make only interest payments, says a
person familiar with the matter. The company has agreed to meet with creditors in mid-January to discuss
repaying the loan.
In defaulting on the debt, Vinashin has added to a catalog of problems afflicting Vietnam, once one of the
world's hottest emerging markets.
Over the past decade, the country's economy has expanded from crater-pocked rice paddies to erect
gleaming new factories and towering skyscrapers, prompting development economists to extol the country as
a model for other frontier markets. On the narrow streets of Hanoi, Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars now
compete for space with rickshaws and motor-scooters.
In the past few weeks, the cost of Vietnam's poorly policed transformation has become alarmingly clear,
offering food for thought for investors seeking rising returns elsewhere on the frontier-markets map.
Economists say the country's worsening problems, and the impact they could have on its dwindling currency,
might also worry textile and agricultural producers in countries like Thailand and Indonesia which compete
with Vietnam in those sectors.
Inflation is soaring, reaching 11.75% year-to-year in December, while Moody's Investors Service, Standard &
Poor's and Fitch Ratings have all downgraded Vietnam's credit ratings because of its relentless focus on
pumping up growth in the past six months. The government, meanwhile, appears set to continue its rolling
devaluations of Vietnam's dong currency while ordinary people scramble to stock up on U.S. dollars or gold.
Since mid-2008, the dong has lost around a fifth of its value as Vietnam floods the banking system with
money.
Vinashin's escalating debt problems are a fresh flash point, threatening to further raise the government's
borrowing costs overseas just when it hopes to raise funds to improve the economy's creaking infrastructure.
Vinashin borrowed aggressively with the encouragement of the government in the hope of becoming a global
player in the shipbuilding industry. It was part of a government-directed plan to keep large chunks of the
Vietnamese economy under state control. But this summer Vinashin nearly collapsed with $4.4 billion in
debts, leading to the arrest of top executives for allegedly mismanaging the firm, one of Vietnam's biggest
employers. The outcry was sufficient to prompt Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to acknowledge his own
mistakes in failing to properly supervise Vinashin, which internal government documents describe as "out of
control."
Some analysts see Vinashin's default as potentially a make-or-break moment for Vietnam. By choosing not to
bail out the company, says Kevin Grice, an economist with London-based Capital Economics, Vietnam's
government is sending a message to other large state-owned enterprises to put their own houses in order
and to root out the inefficiency that plagues the state sector here.
But he and other analysts caution it will work only if Hanoi toughens the way it supervises the state sector,
which constitutes about a third of the economy and diverts resources from more efficient private firms.
Vietnam also needs to move quickly to curb inflation and wean itself off its long-standing emphasis on
promoting rapid growth whatever the cost. "The longer they delay reform, the worse it will be when the
markets force them to do it, but old habits die hard," Mr. Grice says.

--- Page 19 ---

Prospects for a wholesale shake-up seem dim. Ju Wang, a credit-markets strategist with UBS AG in
Singapore, says reducing the moral hazard might be on the government's mind, but so too might be
Vietnam's paltry foreign reserves. The $14 billion the International Monetary Fund reported Vietnam as
having at the end of September is "barely enough to cover short-term debt of around $6 billion to $7 billion
and a wide trade deficit of $12 billion" that the government projects for this year, the strategist says.
Vietnam has a chance to change course and adopt a more prudent growth trajectory at the Communist
Party's Congress which begins Jan. 11. The meeting will select a new party chief and also recommend a new
president of the country's rubber-stamp legislature while determining whether the key figure, the premier, Mr.
Dung, keeps his job for a second, five-year term. The meeting will also set the country's economic-policy
direction for the next five years.
But people familiar with the party's policy discussions, say the country's top rulers are unwilling to make a
break from their high-growth policies.
Economists say part of the problem is that the party promotes officials based on their ability to hit growth
targets, fill quotas and complete five-year plans. Often they hit these targets with little regard for the
inflationary consequences or the spread of corruption that many analysts say is endemic here.
"Growth is the only thing the party understands, so that's what everybody chases," says a government official.
"Nothing will change until a new generation of leaders comes in, and that's not going to happen yet."
Other Vietnamese analysts are more pessimistic, especially as the government has only nudged up its
benchmark interest rate, to 9% from 8%, since November 2009, despite a rapid uptick in inflation.
"The government people are talking about targeting inflation to some extent, but their target is 7%, which is
the same target they had for this year," says Nguyen Quang A, who headed Vietnam's only independent think
tank before its founders closed it under pressure from the Communist Party. "The pro-growth fixation here is
a kind of mania," he says. "Vietnam is dancing on a razor blade."

Oil Back At $90 As Growth Gains Pace
Oil Back At $90 As Growth Gains Pace

Rising demand for petroleum -- notably from U.S. motorists and Chinese manufacturers -- has helped push
oil above $90 a barrel for the first time since the early days of the financial crisis.
The recovery in oil prices is an encouraging sign of world growth, but the spike in crude, if unchecked, also
could pose problems for consumers whose incomes remain pinched.
Crude oil closed above $90 on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday for the first time since
October 2008, after prices fell in the early months of the financial crisis and global recession. The price of
crude had held above $80 for much of 2010, and crept up in recent weeks.
Crude's rise is hitting motorists in the wallet. The average price for a gallon of gasoline reached $3 for the first
time in two years, after increasing 10.9% since this summer, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report.
U.S. drivers will likely see further inflation at the pump soon, in part because refineries have lowered their
inventories to avoid an end-of-the-year tax hit. Leaner inventories cause higher crude prices to filter down to
drivers more quickly than usual.
Unlike price spikes in 2005 and 2006, the chief culprit isn't a sudden disruption in global crude supplies. The
world is now awash in crude: Iraq is expected to substantially raise exports next year, and Saudi Arabia has a
secure cushion of production it can turn on at any time.
"The market sentiment is being driven by the assumption that economic recovery will translate into a
physically tighter oil market," said Tim Evans, an analyst at Citi Futures Perspective. "The reality I see is that
oil production is easily keeping pace with the recovery in demand."
Citi Futures expects crude-oil prices to rise to $93 a barrel in the next six to 12 months. Some analysts have
projected that the price could pop above $100 a barrel again in 2011.
Oil is but one of many commodities and financial assets to spike this year as the world economic recovery
has gathered pace. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.2%, or 26.33 points, to
11,559.49, leaving the blue-chip stock index up 10.9% this year and at its highest point since August 2008.
Gold is up 27% this year, as investors chase the metal as a hedge against inflation. Industrial demand for
copper this week sent that metal to a record high of $4.2705 per pound, up 28% this year.
Oil, because of its role in powering car and air transport, has an especially large impact on the economy.
Global demand is on track to hit an all-time high in 2010, growing 2.9% to 87.45 million barrels a day,
according to the International Energy Agency. The agency forecast a further expansion in 2011, although at a
slower pace, to 88.77 million barrels a day.
Meanwhile, hedge funds and individual investors are buying up financial instruments tied to the price of
crude, and thereby helping push up oil prices. A massive flood of investment dollars into commodities was a
major cause of the 2008 oil price spike and appears to be playing a role today as well.
The rising cost of crude could ultimately slow the global economic recovery, but so far there has been little
protest by importing nations. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which met earlier this
month in Ecuador, indicated it was comfortable with $90-a-barrel oil prices. Nations with ambitious
energy-conservation and renewable-energy programs appear particularly willing to let prices rise.
Oil prices are up 26.3% since late August, in part for the same reason stocks and other commodities have
also risen: an expectation of improved global growth and investor willingness to take on more risk because of
the U.S. Federal Reserve's steps to pump up the economy.

--- Page 21 ---

Recent conditions have bolstered oil companies' confidence. Globally, they are expected to spend $490
billion next year to find and produce oil and natural gas, breaking a record set in 2008.
Oil observers have been surprised by the strong demand for crude this year, even as large swathes of the
global economy are still limping along.
The world gulped 2.5 million more barrels of oil per day than a year ago, for the second-highest growth in oil
consumption since the 1970s, according to the International Energy Agency.
As the first data indicating sudden growth began emerging over the summer, many market observers chalked
it up to refineries hoarding crude. They doubted that the data translated into an increase in demand from
drivers and other consumers. But as more data emerged, it has become clearer that demand has been
substantial in 2010.
"We were skeptical two to three months ago, but gradually we are becoming convinced," said Manouchehr
Takin, a senior petroleum analyst at London's Center for Global Energy Studies.
Most of the demand growth is coming from Asian economies -- such as China, India and parts of the Middle
East.
Even the beleaguered U.S. driver is expected to buy more. The International Energy Agency recently nudged
upward its 2011 U.S. gasoline-consumption forecast due to higher demand.
"I'm spending way more on gas," said Shana Baker, a 36-year-old sales support representative in Dallas,
while filling up her minivan. "It takes away from other things, like the grocery budget."
Some skeptics don't believe current prices can be sustained. "It is very easy to read too much into the data,"
said Antoine Halff, deputy head of research at commodity brokerage firm Newedge USA. The banks, he said,
"are feeding on the data to project a bullish market."
Ken Williams, a heating-oil dealer in Boston, was also watching the move of oil prices on Wednesday.
"I am certainly concerned that it will hurt demand, but I am more concerned about the affordability of the
product, because it's a necessity," he said.

World News: ECB Seeks Funds For Capital Base
World News: ECB Seeks Funds For Capital Base

FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank covered its flank against possible losses associated with its
financial-support measures, a stern reminder to government leaders that the bank's unprecedented foray into
government bond markets carries risk.
The ECB will nearly double its capital base, to 10.8 billion euros ($14.28 billion) from 5.8 billion euros, citing
"increased volatility in foreign-exchange markets, interest rates and gold prices as well as credit risk." The
ECB made the decision at its regular monthly meeting, while European leaders meeting in Brussels backed
plans for a new fund to rescue ailing euro-zone countries.
The central bank hasn't changed its capital base for 12 years, even as its asset holdings have ballooned to
around 2 trillion euros since the onset of the financial crisis more than two years ago. The latest rise reflects
the need for "adequate capital base in a financial system that has grown considerably," the ECB said.
Given the size of its balance sheet, even doubling the ECB's capital leaves the bank highly leveraged. Still,
the central bank has considerable resources at its disposal, including vast holdings of ultra-safe assets such
as gold. And as printer of a reserve currency, the ECB receives fees that could also be used to buffer its
capital base.
However, by approving a capital increase, the ECB sends a powerful signal to government leaders meeting in
Brussels Thursday and Friday that the central bank's generous loans to banks and its purchases of
government bonds of the region's weakest countries "aren't without risk," says Carsten Brzeski, economist at
ING Bank in Brussels.
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has pressed government leaders to buttress their own crisis-response
capabilities, and on Monday called for "maximum flexibility and for maximum capacity" in the use of the EU's
440 billion euro rescue fund. Germany, in particular, has resisted increasing the size of the fund, and EU
leaders show little interest in turning the fund into a vehicle that can intervene in markets. That leaves the
ECB as the sole body that can quickly intervene rapidly to prevent contagion from spreading from Greece and
Ireland to other at-risk countries.
So far, the ECB has bought 72 billion euros in government bonds issued by Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
Economists at Barclays Capital estimate that if those holdings were marked to current prices, the ECB would
face paper losses of as much as 5 billion euros. However, assuming the ECB holds those bonds to maturity,
then the only way it would lose money would be through a default or restructuring.
The capital increase by itself won't cost governments money. The added capital will come through a transfer
of assets from each of the euro's 16 national central banks, based on a weighting determined largely by the
size of their economies. The contribution of Germany's Bundesbank will be the largest, roughly 1 billion euros
over three years.

Global Finance: CFTC Vote on Trading Curbs Stalls

WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators Thursday released a broad proposal that seeks to curb speculative trading
in oil, metals and other commodities, but held off voting on it in another setback for efforts to put in place
Congress's Wall Street overhaul.
The new rules would limit the size of the positions traders could take in the commodities. They respond in
part to the spike in oil prices above $140 a barrel in 2008, which some critics blamed on regulators' alleged
failure to keep a tighter leash on speculation.
Top commodities regulator Gary Gensler has been pushing for position limits since last year, and the
Dodd-Frank financial law passed in July authorizes his Commodity Futures Trading Commission to act.
The commission was nearly ready to do so Thursday, as the five-member body met with a draft of the rules
before it. But Mr. Gensler had cold feet at the last moment after commissioners expressed concern, and put
off a vote on a formal proposal, probably until January. After a public-comment period, a second vote would
be needed to make the proposal final.
"I think it's just appropriate to let this one ripen a little bit more," Mr. Gensler said.
The delay highlighted concerns among some, including Republicans in Congress, that the CFTC isn't taking
enough care as it writes rules to meet deadlines under the Dodd-Frank law.
The law gives broad new powers to the CFTC, sparking a rolling battle with Wall Street about issues that will
shape markets for many years to come.
For commodities, regulators want to limit positions across all trading venues as well as positions for a given
"spot month," or the month when a contract expires. The draft plan would set a cap on spot-month positions
to 25% of deliverable supply for a given commodity.
The commission estimated that about 70 agricultural commodity traders, six base-metal traders, eight
precious-metal traders and 40 energy traders have the kind of large-volume business that might cause them
to be affected by the new spot-month limits.
The proposal on position limits would cover on- and off-exchange trading in 28 commodities, including gold,
platinum, copper, gasoline and coffee.
The draft rules reverberated in the market, as traders tried to figure out whether the limits would force
changes or even lead some players to head to less-regulated markets overseas.
Traders with Sucden Financial said in a note to clients that a selloff in gold and silver futures on Thursday
was tied to profit-taking that "emerged after the U.S. financial regulator (CFTC) outlined aggressive steps to
prevent excessive speculation distorting commodity prices."
Some CFTC officials raised concerns that the proposal wouldn't work as intended.
"Will these limits actually minimize price distortions or curb excessive speculation? Will they serve to prevent
price spikes? I remain to be convinced of the first and in response to the second question I am certain they
will not," Commissioner Scott O'Malia said.
And Commissioner Bart Chilton, a strong backer of position limits, asked how traders would be treated while
the rules are being phased in. That led Mr. Gensler to say it would "helpful to have more discussion." He
directed his staff to review large trader positions.

The chairman followed a similar tack last week when he delayed a vote on a proposal that would bring more
transparency to the trading of swaps, privately negotiated financial instruments often used by corporations to
protect their bottom line from swings in commodity prices or interest rates.
After a week of fine-tuning the proposal, the commission voted 4-1 Thursday to formally issue it. It would
create a new type of trading operation which matches buyers and sellers and provides more transparent
pricing.
John Hyland, chief investment officer at the U.S. Oil Fund, said the draft position-limit rule, if put in place,
could affect which commodities exchanges get business. For instance, he said the rule limiting positions to
25% in physically settled contracts-where the actual commodity is delivered-could push investors into
financially-settled contracts.

Commodities (A Special Report) --- How to Play the Gold Game: What's the best way to turn the
yellow metal into green? Four prominent investors share their strategies

They're gold diggers of the new millennium, sifting for fortune amid soaring prices for the yellow metal.
But today's gutsy investors are panning for gold in very different ways.
Just as California's Gold Rush in the 19th century drew miners to the West with different strategies on how to
profit, some of today's most notable investors are pursuing distinct tactics to wager on a rise in gold. Some
are scooping up exchange-traded funds and mining companies. Others are betting on futures and derivatives
markets. Still others are storing vast amounts of gold in secret warehouses in the U.S. or in foreign countries.
Some of the investors making the biggest bets on bullion are well worth watching. John Paulson and David
Einhorn were early predictors of the subprime-mortgage and financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008. Thomas
Kaplan and John Burbank were wagering on mining shares several years ago, when their rivals snickered.
Gold prices have been climbing amid worries about leading currencies and future inflation. Other factors
include a growing number of ETFs and other investment vehicles that offer plays on the commodity. It's also
getting harder to tap new ore veins, limiting supply.
The four investors featured here don't always agree, nor do they always get it right. But here are some of the
strategies they're pursuing:
John Paulson
Big Miners
Mr. Paulson made his reputation by scoring $20 billion in 2007-08, anticipating the financial meltdown and
buying inexpensive protection.
Today it's potential inflation he's worried about.
Mr. Paulson, who operates one of the largest hedge funds in the world, is buying shares of some of the
biggest mining and exploration companies, part of an investment of more than $10 billion in gold. His firm,
Paulson & Co ., owns nearly 11% of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd . and almost 3% of Kinross Gold Corp . He also
owns select smaller miners.
Shares of mining companies can act as a leveraged bet on gold, Mr. Paulson has argued. If gold prices do
well, the miners will do even better. They could rise two or three times as much as the price of gold, he has
told investors. That's because the higher gold prices go, the more miners can profit from existing and
potential projects. Digging for gold can be expensive, but as prices rise big miners can score profits as they
tap projects that were difficult or costly to mine.
So far Mr. Paulson's strategy is working. His gold fund was up 33% in 2010 through November, topping the
rise in gold futures.
Thomas Kaplan
Junior Miners
Mr. Kaplan is a low-profile billionaire making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor. Through a firm
that invests his family's money, Tigris Financial Group, and affiliates, Mr. Kaplan has acquired stakes in
mining properties on five continents; his gold holdings are valued at more than $2 billion.

--- Page 26 ---
Page 26 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Mr. Kaplan also controls as much as 30% of a group of smaller mining companies, called junior miners,
including many that have yet to produce an ounce of gold. These companies are sitting on valuable assets,
Mr. Kaplan argues, providing "the greatest leverage to a bull market."
"We are entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great precious-metals assets," he says.
His firm, for example, owns nearly 18% of Gabriel Resources Ltd ., which owns 80% of a gold mine in
Romania that is Europe's biggest but has yet to produce any gold. That's partly due to questions raised about
the environmental impact that may result from tapping the mine. His firm also owns more than 23% of
NovaGold Resources Inc ., a $3.3 billion mining company whose shares have roughly tripled in the past 12
months.
George Soros and Mr. Paulson also own slugs of some of these smaller companies. But Mr. Kaplan owns
larger stakes, underscoring his conviction that junior miners have bigger upside potential, even if they are
riskier because they're unproven. "It's not the kind of thing I would suggest for widows and orphans," he says.
John Burbank
Gold Bars
Some investors are wary of miners because various companies have failed to generate huge profits due to
lackluster management. Others worry that ETFs depend on others to store gold bullion in vaults, meaning
added cost, risk of theft or damage, and no way for investors to get their hands on the bullion in the event of a
crisis.
Holding gold oneself is a better move, these investors say. Among the most vocal: Mr. Burbank, who runs
hedge fund Passport Capital in San Francisco. He stores his gold in a Zurich vault operated by UBS .
Mr. Burbank argues that storage costs are lower than the expenses of ETFs. He also says a squeeze may
develop that could benefit holders of physical gold at the expense of gold contracts and shares. If investors
become concerned that shares and futures contracts aren't fully backed by physical gold, or if inflation
surges, they may begin to demand delivery of the metal, sending the price of physical gold soaring, he
argues.
There's no sign of such a sudden spike, but Mr. Burbank and his fellow gold bugs are trying to find the best
way to profit if it does.
David Einhorn
Gold ETFs, Futures and Bars
Mr. Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital , also argues that owning gold bars is the best strategy;
he stores his firm's in an undisclosed warehouse in the New York borough of Queens.
Beyond that, Mr. Einhorn is a fan of exchange-traded funds that own gold miners. His firm owns about 2% of
Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF , which tracks gold-mining shares.
Mr. Einhorn, who has made gold his firm's largest position, also has purchased some call options on gold, or
futures contracts that allow his firm to buy gold at a set price in the future.
Gold futures are the best way to invest in gold, some say, because they track gold with fewer transaction
costs than gold shares or ETFs. And investors don't have to commit much money to control a big gold
position. The risk, of course, is that a tumble in gold price can wipe out the collateral behind a gold-futures
position.

Vietnam Battles Dark Side of Boom

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- At a time when many emerging markets are trying to stem a destabilizing rise
in their local currencies against the dollar, up-and-coming Vietnam is grappling with a rather different
problem: Residents can't get enough of the U.S. greenback, as their own currency, the dong, threatens to
spiral lower.
Moody's Investors Service signaled the extent of the problems Wednesday, downgrading its rating on
Vietnamese government debt to "B1" from "Ba3" in part because of the downward pressure on Vietnam's
currency and the country's worsening inflation problem. It also maintained a negative outlook on the
country's ratings, citing the mounting debt problems at state-run Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group as
another reason for the downgrade.
Call it the dark side of Vietnam's economic boom. In recent years, Vietnam has established itself as a major
production hub for the global economy, luring big names such as Canon Inc . and Intel Corp . to its shores
and racking up some of the fastest growth rates in Asia after China.
But the Communist-run government's determination to hit persistently high growth targets, coupled with
state-directed lending growth of more than 30% annually in recent years, have flooded Vietnam's economy
with money and caused a raft of problems for the local currency. The excess capital has triggered a sharper
uptick in inflation than has been seen in other emerging markets, stripping confidence in the dong as
residents doubt their government can manage rising costs in the months ahead.
Meanwhile, unlike many Asian countries, Vietnam runs a substantial trade deficit, which adds further
downward pressure on the dong. Officials here expect a deficit of $12 billion this year, little changed from
2009.
The dong already has lost about one-fifth of its value against the U.S. dollar since mid-2008, and
black-market rates for dollars currently are about 10% above the official exchange rate. That is fueling
speculation that the government will be forced to devalue the dong again in the next few months to bring
official values closer in line with street rates.
Vietnam's currency woes serve as a reminder that not all emerging markets are the same at a time when
investors are pouring money into frontier economies world-wide.
Most of Vietnam's neighbors, including Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea, are seeing their currencies
shoot up in value as investors bet on stronger growth in Asian markets while the U.S. and Europe slog
through slow recoveries from the latest global recession, sending the dollar and the euro lower.
Stronger currencies are a problem for many Asian countries because they make those countries' export
sectors less competitive on global markets.
But that isn't an issue for Vietnam. Instead, residents now are hoarding dollars and other stores of value
because they consider just about anything to be better than the dong.
The gold and jewelry stores along Ho Chi Minh City's Le Loi Street are doing a roaring trade most mornings,
selling everything from U.S. dollars to South Korean won to residents desperate to unload their dong. The
biggest trades often are made by vendors who also hawk goods like shirts, shoes and dried mangoes at the
cavernous Ben Thanh market nearby. On a recent Tuesday, Nguyen Thi Phuong placed several bricks of
Vietnamese dong on the glass table at Thuy Van's kiosk and asked how much to convert it into gold. The
answer: 36.7 million dong per tael, or $1,447 an ounce, about 2.3% higher than international prices that day.
"It's worth it for the peace of mind," Ms. Phuong says.

--- Page 28 ---
Page 28 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
This loss of faith in the dong also presents a challenge for Vietnam's Communist leaders who, until now, have
relied on rapid economic growth to keep the country's 85 million people satisfied.
As the dong weakens, it is driving up the cost of imported goods and ratcheting up fears of higher inflation
rates to come. The consumer-price index hit 11.1% in November, virtually assuring the full-year inflation rate
will hit double figures. Economic growth overall is expected to reach 6.7%.
Last month, the central bank pushed up its benchmark lending rate to 9% from 8% to help support the dong
and contain prices, while the government has slapped a 10% tax on gold exports to help sustain the supply
of the metal and avert any potential panic.
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has ordered government ministries to set prices on goods such as coal and
gasoline to keep price rises in check. Among his tools, so far unused, are new rules enabling the government
to impose price controls on goods and services produced by foreign and private companies in addition to
those of state-owned enterprises.
"All the authorities should take strong measures to control gold prices and stabilize the foreign-exchange
rates and interest rates, and punish speculation in gold and foreign currencies," Mr. Dung said earlier this
month.
It is unclear whether the current policies are enough to stop the rot. In a research note to clients this month,
Capital Economics asked whether Vietnam is heading for a crisis in 2011.
The answer, said economist Kevin Grice, is "yes" unless Vietnam moves more aggressively to let interest
rates rise further and does more to tackle state-enterprise spending that, while encouraging growth, also
contributes to a large budget deficit.

Stocks Touch 2-Year Highs; Bonds Suffer
Tuesday's Markets
Stocks Touch 2-Year Highs; Bonds Suffer

Stocks crept to a two-year high on Tuesday on the back of positive economic news and a fresh commitment
by the Federal Reserve to keep pumping cash into the markets.
The rally was clouded, however, by another spike in government-bond yields, sending rates on 10-year
Treasury notes to a seven-month high, and another brutal day for municipal bonds, whose rates rose to the
highest levels since March 2009.
Though interest rates on Treasurys are rising partly because of better prospects for economic growth, they
also could pose a challenge to housing and other sectors of the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.98, or 0.4%, to end the day at 11476.54, the blue-chip measure's
highest close since Sep. 8, 2008, a week before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy triggered a global financial
crisis.
The Nasdaq Composite index rose 2.81, or 0.1%, to 2627.72. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose
1.13 points, or less than 0.1%, to 1241.59, its highest close since Sep. 19, 2008.
Stocks barely registered the results of the latest Fed policy meeting Tuesday afternoon, the results of which
surprised roughly few.
Policy makers kept overnight interest rates unchanged and pledged again to buy $600 billion in Treasury
debt through next June in an effort to support risk-taking and economic growth.
But this easy-money spigot has already helped drive investors into stocks and other risky assets, contributing
heavily to the Dow's 18.5% rally since early July. And few investors are willing to bet the cash-fueled rally will
end any time soon.
"Equity guys love this. The more stimulus the better for them," said Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis
Trading in Chatham, N.J. "It's still this momentum-fueled craziness, this performance-chasing type of rally."
The risk-taking appetite was whetted early Tuesday with a batch of improved economic numbers. November
retail-sales data from the Census Bureau topped forecasts, and small-business sentiment improved to its
highest level in three years, according to the National Federation of Independent Business.
Also, corporate treasurers turned noticeably more optimistic in early December, according to the latest survey
of chief financial officers by Duke University and CFO Magazine.
"There are still obviously risks and uncertainties out there, but this is the best survey we've had since before
the recession," said Duke finance professor John Graham, director of the survey.
But the good economic news has contributed to an ongoing crunch in the Treasury market. The 10-year
Treasury note ended Tuesday yielding 3.457%, its highest closing yield since May 17. Bond yields and prices
move in opposite directions.
The 10-year-note yield has surged more than a full percentage point since early October, driving mortgage
rates higher and snuffing out a refinancing boomlet that had put billions of dollars in consumers' pockets.
The 10-year yield has returned to its levels before the market started pricing in the latest Fed bond-buying
program, noted David Ader, head of government-bond strategy at CRT Capital. "Is this the level of rates that
makes the Fed nervous?" he asked in a note. "Well, it was in the second quarter of 2010."

Rates jumped in the hour after the Fed's decision, for little apparent reason, possibly contributing to a
late-day pause in the stock rally. Selling has led to more selling in recent weeks as traders rush to cash in
their still-profitable Treasury investments before year-end.
"This selloff has become a vicious, as opposed to a virtuous, cycle," said Russ Certo, co-head of rate trading
at Gleacher & Co ., a boutique investment bank and bond dealer.
Commodities were mixed on the day. Nymex crude-oil futures fell 33 cents to $88.28 a barrel. Comex gold
edged up $6.30 to $1403.60 per ounce.
Meantime, muni-bond prices fell sharply for the second day Tuesday, as investors worried about the impact
of the end of the Build America Bond borrowing program.
The yield on a closely watched index of high-grade, tax-exempt 30-year muni bonds rose to 4.81%, its
highest level since March 2009, according to initial indications from Municipal Market Data.
Another dark spot for the market was Best Buy , which tumbled $6.18, or 15%, to $35.52, after the company
issued a dour report for the quarter ended Nov. 27, which included Black Friday. Best Buy 's earnings came
in well below analysts' estimates as revenue unexpectedly fell. The retailer also cut its earnings view for the
year.
Bank stocks also fell, including Dow components J.P. Morgan Chase , down 0.72, or 1.73%, to 40.79, and
Bank of America , off 0.14, or 1.12%, to 12.40.
The Dow was mainly led higher by technology giant IBM, up 1.54, or nearly 1.1%, to 145.82.
Among other stocks, Amgen rose 2.65, or 4.9%, to 56.76. The biotechnology company said a study of its key
bone drug Xgeva showed it helped prostate-cancer patients live longer.
HCP edged up 44 cents, or 1.4%, to 32.96, after the real-estate investment trust said it will buy all of the
real-estate assets of privately owned nursing-home operator HCR ManorCare for $6.1 billion.
Sanderson Farms rose 2.33, or 5.5%, to 40.15. The poultry producer's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings more
than doubled.
C.R. Bard advanced 3.52, or 4.1%, to 89.57. The medical-device maker said it is targeting double-digit
earnings growth next year amid a boost from a stock buyback plan, and announced restructuring measures
that will include job cuts.
Williams Partners LP slipped 2.42, or 5%, to 46.50. The natural-gas company said its planned sale of
common units, which was raised in size to at least 8 million units, priced at an estimated $47.55 each, a 2.8%
discount to Monday's close.

Australia Hosts Oprah Government Invests in Winfrey's Clout to Boost Tourism

SYDNEY -- Oprah Winfrey spent this week helping to sell Australia to the world as the country looks for new
ways to stem a sharp fall in tourism at a time when the strength of its currency makes it an increasingly
unaffordable destination.
Outbound travelers now exceed arrivals by roughly 1.2 million a year, according to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics, with the 20% appreciation of the Australian dollar since the middle of the year against the U.S.
dollar blamed as the biggest turnoff for tourists from Europe and the U.S.
The Australian government has invested three million Australian dollars (US$2.9 million) to host Ms. Winfrey
and her entourage, including 200 support staff and 18 tons of filming equipment, to shoot a several episodes
of her top-rated talk show in the country. The country's flag carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd ., provided the flights
from the U.S. and within Australia.
The government's aim is to protect an industry that accounts for 2.6% of gross domestic product, or A$26
billion of revenue.
The slump in tourism is one of the few bleak spots in an economy forecast to expand by more than 3.5% next
year, according to the country's central bank, as demand from Asia for its resources drives growth.
"It's been quite difficult in the local tourism industry and that is going to have an impact on the broader
economy," said Stephen Roberts, a Sydney-based economist for Japanese investment bank Nomura.
Thousands queued Tuesday to view filming or gain a glimpse of the show outside the Sydney Opera House
where Ms. Winfrey discussed the country's virtues as a holiday destination with guests including actress
Nicole Kidman.
Many observers like Jenifer Ablan, a schoolteacher from the city's southern suburbs, were unconvinced that
the four shows, set to air in January to an average weekly U.S. audience of 40 million, will help offset the
impact of the Australian dollar on tourism.
"I had to bring my kids to see Oprah but it's just too bad about the dollar," Ms. Ablan said.
The Australian currency is trading close to 28-year highs.
Ms. Winfrey's ability to sell almost anything to her fans is well chronicled. Upon being included in her book
club, publishers immediately order printing in the hundreds of thousands to prepare for coming sales.
For Qantas, Ms. Winfrey's visit comes as it seeks to deflect attention from an engine failure last month on one
of its Airbus A380 superjumbos that forced it to briefly ground its entire fleet of the aircraft.
Qantas flew some 300 audience members of 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' from the U.S., and has since
provided 88 flights for the group to visit some of the country's best-known attractions, including Uluru, or
Ayers Rock, and Port Arthur in the remote southern state of Tasmania.
"This is marketing gold," said Alan Joyce , the airline's chief executive, after attending the filming of Ms.
Winfrey's show in Sydney.
The flight across the Pacific from the U.S. is a key route for the airline, which is keen to see its investment in
Ms. Winfrey's tour of Australia help reverse a 9% drop in U.S. arrivals over the past year, according to data
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. On the flip side for Qantas, travel by Australians out of the country is
up 25% over the period, according to the government agency.

What isn't in doubt is Ms. Winfrey's confidence that she can help bring Australia once again to the attention of
Americans.
"I have named myself the unofficial ambassador for Australia and I have the biggest mouth on earth," she told
the crowd gathered in Sydney on Tuesday.

Corrections & Amplifications
NAPFA is the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. The organization was incorrectly identified
as the National Association of Professional Financial Advisors in an article in Monday's Wealth Adviser
Journal Report about a panel's recommendations for 2011.
(WSJ Dec. 13, 2010)
(END)
Pessimists and skeptics rule these days when it comes to individual investors. And after the past few years,
it's little wonder. So how do financial advisers deal with that fear, and, more specifically, what are they
recommending their clients do now?
Daisy Maxey, a reporter with Dow Jones Newswires, and John Leger, a news editor with The Wall Street
Journal, sat down with three fee-only financial advisers to talk about both issues.
The panelists: Michael J. Garry, managing member and chief compliance officer of Yardley Wealth
Management in Newtown, Pa.; Cheryl R. Holland, president, Abacus Planning Group Inc., Columbia, S.C.;
and John K. Ritter, co-owner, managing partner and senior adviser, Ritter Daniher Financial Advisory LLC,
Cincinnati, Ohio.
Here are edited excerpts of the discussion.
DAISY MAXEY: Investors are pretty fearful, and it's been a rocky few years. What are you expecting in 2011
for the economy and the markets?
JOHN K. RITTER: I probably have never seen clients as pessimistic and fearful as they have been recently.
And even though we've come out of the bottoming-out process and actually have come out pretty strongly,
they're still viewing the glass as not just half-empty but mostly empty.
We've been telling people that if that level of negativity is priced in, the surprises are more likely to be on the
upside than on the downside. We expect that we're going to still continue to have a slow-growth economy.
Slow and lumpy.
MICHAEL J. GARRY: I agree, people are very fearful. I also agree that we're more likely to have a surprise to
the upside than to the downside.
As far as the economy next year, who knows? But I think some sort of a lumpy, gradual growth will happen.
CHERYL R. HOLLAND: I think in addition to being fearful, clients are quite fragile. There's an emotional
undertone to how they're responding to news that doesn't necessarily have to do with how their portfolio is
performing.
Cash In or Out?
MS. MAXEY: Risk-averse investors have been piling into fixed income. But still, there's a lot of cash on the
sidelines. Should investors start to take on a bit more risk now, and where should they put their money?
MR. GARRY: Most investors will find over the long run that the cash and fixed investments they have are not
going to meet their goals. Certainly, some cash is a great thing and everybody needs some sort of allocation
to fixed income. For people who have been sitting on the sidelines for the last year or year-and-a-half, I think

--- Page 37 ---
Page 37 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
they really need to take a look at their overall portfolio and figure out how to get it to where it needs to be in
the most efficient way that they can.
MS. HOLLAND: For an individual who actually understands their risk tolerance, whether it's very aggressive
or very conservative, and sticks with that through thick and thin, if you look at their portfolio returns, they are
much more successful, on either side of the equation, than those who don't understand their risk tolerance
and are moving around.
MR. RITTER: The biggest thing that we've been focusing on is continuing to make sure people are grounded
in the asset-allocation process.
Those that stuck with it have been rewarded; those that rebalanced appropriately and did not deviate from
their asset-allocation targets. Those that took the wild swings -- it's a two-way street. You're making a
decision to opt out of your asset-allocation model, but then you have to make a decision to opt back in. And
that opting-back-in process is often harder than the decision to sell.
The other thing that we've really layered in is an allocation to cash, but not from an investment standpoint. It
is solely a piece-of-mind decision. We refer to it as carved-off cash. And if we have this carved-out-cash
component, people can say, "OK, I can stick with a growth model or a moderate model as long as I know I've
got X-thousand dollars on the sidelines."
MS. MAXEY: How much do you think investors should be allocating to foreign investments? Are there certain
areas or specific emerging-market investments that you like?
MR. GARRY: We generally have somewhere between 25% and a third of someone's equity portfolio in
foreign investments, and usually between 4% and 7% of that is in emerging markets.
MS. HOLLAND: We have a somewhat broader global footprint: probably closer to 45% international. And,
emerging markets is probably between 8% and 10% of each client's total portfolio. But that has been a
gradual move up over the past decade. The only thing that makes me nervous is all my clients love the fact
that we're in that. If all the clients are buying into an idea, maybe it's not the smartest idea.
MR. RITTER: About a 35% allocation of our equity component is international, including about 10% to
emerging markets. It has been trickling up. I would expect that, over time, it will continue to trickle up.
With the rebalancing process, hopefully you are taking a little bit of the profits off the table. People hear the
positive story about the emerging-market growth. They forget that the volatility can be really off the charts at
times.
MS. MAXEY: How much should investors be allocating to alternative investments and are there specific ones
you're recommending?
MS. HOLLAND: An increasing number of mutual-fund managers use a variety of techniques beyond buying
and selling of stocks or bonds. We probably have about 20% of our portfolio in those types of investments.
We also have historically done direct investments in real estate, oil and gas and timber. It's not for everybody.
There's a lot of due diligence, a lot of problems. But I do look at clients who have those in their portfolio and I
think their annualized return is probably about one percentage point better than clients who don't have them.
MR. RITTER: We have a 25% allocation to alternative investments for all of our clients. But what do you
define as alternatives?
In our alternatives space, it's exactly as she just said -- real estate, commodities, then we have the category
referred to as nontraditional. It can be funds that are market-neutral, it could be hedge-fund-like products. It's
been a growing category.
MS. MAXEY: Inflation fears have been rising. And demand for Treasury inflation-protected securities is
quite high. Are investors overreacting on those fears? Where should they be putting their money?
MR. GARRY: It's hard to say whether they're overreacting. We've been talking about inflation for years and it
hasn't happened yet. But that's something that you'll always have to think about. Our fixed-income allocation
always has a component of TIPS.
MS. HOLLAND: We're not concerned about inflation in the short term. But we always have a mid-term or a
long-term portion of a portfolio to hedge against inflation -- TIPS, real estate, commodities, direct oil and gas
or direct real estate, which will provide varying levels of protection depending on the type of inflation,
whether it's coming from monetary policy, energy shortage or currency depreciation. We have these
investments to be able to tell people inflation is not your enemy right now, but if it is, here are some
investments that help take that temperature down and those fears away.

--- Page 38 ---
Page 38 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
MR. RITTER: We're positioning bond portfolios a little more aggressively toward TIPS, a little more
aggressively toward international fixed-income. Right now, we're just thinking when this inflation kicks in,
which we really believe it will, we would like to be positioned for it a little bit ahead of time. If we leave a few
pennies on the table now, that's OK. We'd rather do that and protect the portfolios, because we think when it
does hit, it could be a little nastier than people might want to think.
MR. GARRY: We only use short- and intermediate-term bond funds. They're global and they're hedged for
currency.
MS. MAXEY: What are you recommending with regards to converting traditional individual retirement
accounts to Roth IRAs?
MS. HOLLAND: Just to recap for the audience, this year, the IRS laws have changed so that no matter how
much money you make, you have the opportunity to take your money and your retirement plans, pay the
income tax now, and put those dollars in a Roth and let the money grow.
We're doing analyses for each client. It's kind of interesting how it's fallen out: about a third, it doesn't make
sense at all; about a third are kind of in the middle, and we're letting them make that judgment call; and about
a third, it's a real home run to do it.
The key factors are, first, do you have money outside of your IRAs to pay for the income taxes? It almost
never makes sense to take dollars out of your retirement funds to pay the income taxes.
Second, will you ever need that money? For clients for whom this is really a long-term pot of money that more
than likely will be left to their children, it makes great sense because they're prepaying those income taxes for
their children, and it gets that money out of their estate.
Annuity Anxiety
MS. MAXEY: Everyone's been very focused on safety. Are you advising clients to consider annuities and, if
so, what type?
MR. GARRY: I almost never recommend annuities. Most of my new clients have an annuity that was sold to
them for a reason that doesn't really make sense.
MR. RITTER: We definitely have that same experience. And we do work on conversions to other annuity
products, hopefully with a much lower cost structure. That's generally on the variable annuities side.
We have looked a little bit at single-premium immediate annuities just for shifting a bit of the portfolio risk off
to an insurance company and setting up a stream of payments for a client. But it's rare.
MS. HOLLAND: It's difficult to explain to investors that there are many circumstances where an annuity is
appropriate. That's a place where our profession's evolving. I think we'll see this as an increasingly utilized
tool.
MS. MAXEY: The advisory profession is facing a lot of regulatory change. What questions should an investor
be asking an adviser when they sit down for the first time?
MS. HOLLAND: Go to the NAPFA [National Association of Professional Financial Advisors] website. We have
a forum that has a series of questions. Ask for the answers in writing. If you're not willing to write down and
sign your name to what your process for charging fees is going to be, that should be a red flag.
Always check references; clients and allied professionals who are references -- an attorney or a CPA who's
worked with you. And check the public record. You'd be surprised the number of advisers who have a number
of things against them in the public record.
MR. GARRY: I think the important questions to ask are: What qualifies you to offer financial advice? And how
are you compensated?
MR. RITTER: We actually have a form that we hand to prospective clients. It's five questions, real simple
things like how are we compensated -- we're compensated on a fee-only basis.
Investors should understand an adviser's market niche. What types of clients? What's the asset level of the
clients that they work with? Are they active stock pickers or do they believe in an asset-allocation approach?
JOHN LEGER: What do you tell clients who see the frenzy in the precious-metals markets and come to you
and say, get me into precious metals?

--- Page 39 ---

MS. HOLLAND: We have some exposure to gold because we have a commodity exposure, and we try and
explain what that role is. It's a piece of the puzzle, it's not the answer, and it cannot magically do all things. No
investment can.

Commodities' Paths Diverge --- Macroeconomic Forces Take a Back Seat as Fundamental Factors Rule Once Again
Abreast of the Market
Commodities' Paths Diverge --- Macroeconomic Forces Take a Back Seat as Fundamental Factors
Rule Once Again

For much of this year, prices of basic crops, fuels and industrial metals have moved in sync with one another
and in step with the global economic beat.
But in recent weeks, markets for commodities ranging from cotton to oil to copper have been driven more by
their own supply-and-demand dynamics than by the broader outlook for the world economy.
"Commodities are starting to behave like commodities again," said Kevin Norrish, managing director for
commodities research at Barclays Capital.
In the first half of the year, the markets for raw materials often rallied if sentiment favored a continuing
recovery or faltered when the world feared another big slowdown. Prices for crude oil and copper, typically
seen as barometers of economic activity, tracked each other closely.
Now, as investors gain confidence in an economic rebound, the fortunes of individual commodities are
diverging. The gap between the performance of Dow Jones-UBS indexes that track agricultural and energy
commodities is close to its widest point of the year, with crops up 28% this year and fuels down 13%, and
industrial metals smack in the middle, up 8%.
At midyear, by contrast, the year-to-date returns from all three sectors were within less than a percentage
point of one another.
The change has implications not only for investors who turn to commodities in hopes of diversifying their
portfolios, but also for companies that produce or consume raw materials and individuals who buy the goods
they are used to manufacture.
Big-picture economic forces still have the power to move the markets. The prices for many commodities have
risen significantly since the Federal Reserve first signaled its plan in August to pump more money into the
U.S. economy. With interest rates at historic lows, investors have also been piling into raw materials.
Nonetheless, the returns have started to differ. As recently as the end of July, copper and crude oil looked
joined at the hip, with prices for the industrial metal down 0.6% for the year and oil down 0.5%.
Recently, though, copper has been on a tear, rising 7% in December and settling at a record of $4.105 a
pound on Friday, up 23% for the year. The recent rally has come despite worries about potential fallout from
problems in major European economies. That is striking because the copper market wasn't able to weather
similar fears this spring. Prices plunged 17% in just over a month, hitting a low for the year on June 7.
Since then copper is up 49%, reflecting the view of many analysts that copper demand will outpace
production for some time, as emerging markets expand their infrastructure and as new investment products
tie up supplies.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., a miner based in Phoenix, said copper demand has also been
strong in the U.S. and Europe, pointing to usage in automobile wiring and power cords and chargers used
with electronics gear.
Other industrial metals have also risen sharply since midyear, reflecting both the economic backdrop and
supply-demand dynamics.
"The global economy is recovering," said Fred Demler, global head of commodities at MF Global, a
commodities brokerage. "The market is getting tighter."

--- Page 41 ---
Page 41 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Crude oil's recent rise has been more muted. Like copper, oil prices were hit hard by spring fears about
weakness in Europe. Investors have also weighed whether China would tamp down growth, or the U.S. would
slide back into recession. As those fears eased in recent weeks and oil inventories in Western nations shrank
somewhat, oil prices rose and have now traded above $80 a barrel for the longest stretch since late 2008.
Still, oil prices are up just 11% for the year, in part because supplies remain abundant and major
petroleum-exporting countries have the capacity to pump out plenty more.
Worries about supply, meanwhile, have been the driving force sending the prices for some agricultural crops
soaring in the second half of the year.
A summer drought in Russia underscored the threat that weather can pose to production at a time when
China's appetite is increasing. Corn and wheat prices are both up 72% from June lows. Floods in Pakistan
helped push up cotton prices.
To be sure, the balance between supply and demand retained the power to influence commodities prices
even when broader economic concerns generally were foremost in investors' minds. Plentiful supplies of
natural gas have depressed prices, down 21% this year, though the onset of colder weather and the resulting
boost to demand have pushed prices up 6% this month.
Moreover, a renewed plunge into economic crisis could influence and ultimately trump the factors driving
commodities markets at the moment.
"The macro environment is always going to be very important," said Michael Lewis, global head of
commodities research for Deutsche Bank. "The system is still going to be quite fragile."
But, he added, "The physical fundamentals have come back for commodities."

The Farm Belt Boom
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Farm Belt Boom

Copyright 2010 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
The overall U.S. economy may be struggling, but you wouldn't know it from a visit to the Farm Belt. A boom is
under way across much of the rural Midwest, with agricultural land prices growing at a double-digit clip and
farm auctions in certain counties fetching record sales.
One question to ponder: Is this boom rooted in genuine economic gains, or is it another Federal
Reserve-induced asset bubble? We lean toward the bubble view.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago reported in November that farmland values across the upper Midwest
have jumped 10% since 2009. The year-over-year increases were even more dramatic in some states -- 13%
in Iowa, 11% in Indiana. Irrigated cropland is up 11.8% in Nebraska and 12.2% in Kansas, according to the
Kansas City Fed's most recent quarterly survey, which also relays this comment from one district banker:
"Land fever is running rampant."
The signs of a land-grab mania are everywhere. The Des Moines Register reported this week that two tracts
in O'Brien County in the northwestern part of Iowa sold for $9,700 an acre, while one land broker estimated
that farmland has appreciated on average by about $1,000 an acre since the end of the summer. Reports of
bidding wars and $2,000 an acre premiums for top farms are common.
By comparison, Iowa farmland values averaged $4,371 per acre in 2009, and $5,321 for the highest grade
properties, according to Mike Duffy, an Iowa State University agricultural economist who conducts an annual
in-state farmland survey. He'll release figures for 2010 next week, and the trend is expected to be higher.
More than anything, this real estate boom is a result of the extraordinary rally in crop prices. Even after record
prices in 2007 and 2008, the price of corn has climbed 48% since June alone, while soybeans, wheat and
other key grains are all trading well above their prices only a year ago. Last month, John Deere & Co.
forecast that U.S. net farm cash income will climb 31% this fiscal year -- the most profitable agricultural year
in history -- and then jump another 15% in 2011. Naturally, the cost of agricultural land is being bid up as
farmers reinvest their margins in expansion.
The land market is so strong that recent years have seen the rise of the so-called nonfarm investor, or the
outside buyers who some consider speculators. The Iowa State survey shows that investors made a little
more than a fifth of all 2009 purchases, though that figure ranged as high as 40% in 2005. Agriculture plays
are a growing frontier for private equity and institutional funds, both foreign and domestic.
Certainly some of this can be explained by rising global demand for U.S. farm products. Exports have
rebounded amid disappointing harvests world-wide and as incomes and demand rise in China, India and
Russia. Federal ethanol mandates have also fueled the appetite for corn. But the price surge has been so
rapid and so broad across nearly all commodities -- not merely corn or soy, but also oil, gold, base metals,
etc. -- that it can't merely be a function of new demand for specific grains.
This is where monetary policy comes in. As the greenback declines amid easy Fed policy, commodities rise
in value. Farmland booms have typically coincided with periods of Fed easing, such as the 1970s and the late
1980s. It's no accident in our view that the latest commodity price surge began this summer when the Fed's
talk about another round of quantitative easing began in earnest.
In the near term, this commodity boom is wonderful news for the rural Midwest. Rising grain and land prices
flow through the larger agricultural economy, with farm equipment manufacturers, seed and fertilizer
companies and rural financial services all along for the ride. Everyone feels great, no one wants it to end, and
analysts offer explanations for why, this time, the price increases are permanent. Chinese demand!
The problem comes if the boom is an artificial, money-fed bubble. The mid-2000s witnessed a similar
euphoria over U.S. housing, with the Fed also declaiming that the boom was rooted in a natural growth in
demand from immigration and younger families. We know how that turned out.

--- Page 43 ---

The Farm Belt has seen its share of booms and busts over the decades, many rooted in the vagaries of
monetary policy, as land prices crashed and bankruptcy waves rolled over the land. John Cougar
Mellencamp sponsors a "Farm Aid" concert, and taxpayers are hit up for a bailout.
As damaging, overeasy monetary policy and government subsidies (ethanol) distort investment flows and
lead to a misallocation of capital. When a money boom chasing this or that asset bubble is followed by bust,
hundreds of billions of dollars are lost that could have been invested in more productive purposes -- say,
biotechnology, telecom or new roads. As we're learning after the housing bust, it can take years to work
through the economic wreckage.
We hope Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is right when he says asset bubbles and price spikes in commodities
are nothing to worry about. Of course, he said the same thing about housing and oil in the last decade. We're
not predicting an imminent bust, but we do hope someone at the Fed is watching prices grow in farm country.

Investors Pile Into Commodities
Commodities Report
Investors Pile Into Commodities
By Carolyn Cui and Susan Pulliam

Investors are holding their biggest positions on record in the commodities markets as prices surge and
debate intensifies among U.S. regulators about whether to limit the amount that any one trader can bet in
markets for energy, metals and agricultural products.
Hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds dramatically ramped up their holdings in everything from oil
and natural gas to silver, corn and wheat this year. In many cases, the number of contracts held for individual
commodities now far exceeds the amount outstanding in mid-2008, the last time commodity markets were
soaring to records and debate raged about whether excessive speculation was driving up prices.
Contracts held by investors have risen 12% this year through October and are 17% higher than June 2008,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the market regulator.
In several commodities, including the $200 billion crude oil market, so-called speculative investors now make
up a significantly larger proportion of the market than they did in 2008. Investors increased their bullish bets
on crude oil by 24% since June 2008 and now represent 16% of the market, up from 13% just over two years
ago. Bets in the copper market are up 58% and for silver they are up 52%, according to the CFTC data.
The data is based on monthly reports by the CFTC on holdings of commodities through index funds, which
are financial vehicles tracking a basket of commodities. Though it doesn't capture all speculative positions,
CFTC uses this as a guide to see how much of each commodity is held by investors. It contrasts that with
contracts held by producers and consumers.
Speculation in commodities markets has become a hot-button issue among regulators, exchanges and the
trading community. Detractors argue that speculative investors can distort prices and make it harder for
producers and users of commodities to manage their risk. They say it also renders moot traditional
investment factors like supply and demand. But it has yet to be proved whether speculators have such
impact.
The CFTC is under increasing pressure to meet a January deadline set by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform
law, which requires the regulator to set limits on how many commodity futures contracts in energy and metals
a speculator can own. An agriculture proposal is to be implemented by mid-April. So far, the agency hasn't
developed a formal proposal on position limits; it says it is collecting data on the over-the-counter market to
come up with a comprehensive regulatory framework.
The CFTC declined to comment. CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler has said the position-limit plan could be
considered Dec. 16, though that time frame may slip.
Debate within the CFTC is adding to the tension. Bart Chilton, a CFTC commissioner, has been hounding
fellow commissioners to crack down on excessive speculation. "Speculative money from the likes of hedge
funds, index funds and pension funds is coming into the commodity markets at a blistering pace," Mr. Chilton
said in prepared remarks for a speech he plans to make on Wednesday at a conference in New York. He said
that while speculation may not drive up prices, it can distort them. "If prices are skewed in a manner that is
not fair by speculators, consumers can pay more than they should," he said.
The CFTC will hold a public meeting on Thursday to discuss other proposed rulemakings. Position limits
aren't on the schedule, Mr. Chilton said. He said he plans to urge the commission to act more quickly.
According to Barclays Capital, investors have piled a total of $121.2 billion into commodities since the
beginning of 2009. The emergence of exchange-traded funds that buy commodities futures contracts, such
as the U.S. Oil Fund and U.S. Natural Gas Fund, have helped lead a march into commodities over the past
few years. The prospect of a global economic recovery, voracious appetite from China and the Federal

Page 45 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Reserve's rock-bottom interest rates have also helped bolster the view that the bull market for commodities
is likely to continue for some time.
That's helped drive many commodities to new records. Gold has jumped 29% this year and reached a
nominal record of $1,415.30 per troy ounce this week. Copper is up 22% and trading near its record high of
$4.0775 per pound. Silver prices are at 30-year highs and oil on Tuesday surpassed $90 during the trading
day for the first time since October 2008.
However, the latest data also show an increase in speculation doesn't necessarily bring with it an increase in
prices. Natural gas, for example, is down 21% this year despite a surge in speculative bets. In opposite
circumstances with sugar, prices rallied despite a withdrawal of speculative bets.
Commodity exchanges, banks and trading firms have questioned the need for any limits on holdings. They
say the CFTC has failed to demonstrate a link between speculation and rising prices. The CFTC was
examining whether excessive speculation drove oil to a record $147 a barrel in 2008, though has not drawn a
conclusive link. It also spent years probing the impact of speculation on the silver market, though hasn't yet
produced evidence that speculators were deliberately pushing down prices.
"All the statistical tests show that there's not much relationship between increased speculative interest and
price rises," said Philip Verleger, an energy economist who has been following the CFTC data for decades.
The prospect of a potential delay in policing these markets has drawn fire from some groups.
On Tuesday, Public Citizen, a non-profit organization financed by U.S. households, sent a letter to the CFTC
saying "we will do all we can . . . to help ensure that the CFTC fully implements its powers to crack down on
excessive speculation under the timelines set by Congress."

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comment that a further expansion of the central bank's
asset-purchase program was possible sent commodity-related stocks higher in Asia and in Europe.
Oil and gas shares rose on hopes that additional stimulus would devalue the dollar, which would push up
commodity prices. BP gained 3.4% in London and Statoil rose 1.6% in Oslo.
Gold miners got an extra boost from Friday's price of gold, which vaulted past the $1,400 mark. Zhaojin
Mining Industry added 1.4% in Hong Kong, and Shandong Gold-Mining rose 3.1% in Shanghai.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average slipped 0.1% to 10167.23, snapping a three-day winning streak, as
exporters declined on a firmer yen. Canon fell 1%, while Panasonic dropped 1.2%.
In Europe, much of the mood was hampered by worries surrounding the indebted euro-zone nations, as
finance ministers gathered in Brussels to consider their next move in the sovereign-debt crisis.
Banks bore the brunt of the worries, with Societe Generale down 1.8% in Paris and Deutsche Bank losing
1.6% in Frankfurt.
In LONDON, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 0.4% to 5770.28. British supermarket giant Tesco fell 1.6%
after it was downgraded to neutral from buy at UBS. The downgrade sent chills throughout the retail sector.
Carrefour fell 2.5% in Paris and Metro declined 1.2% in Frankfurt.
Europe's major indexes ended either flat or mildly higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 index ended up 0.2% at
271.38, while Germany's DAX index rose 0.1% to 6954.38, and France's CAC-40 index closed flat at
3749.23.
In Asia, China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.5% to 2857.18, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 0.4%
to 23237.69, and Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.9% to 8702.23.
In SYDNEY, shares of Riversdale Mining surged 16% after the company confirmed it was in talks with mining
giant Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto fell 0.5%.
In ZURICH, shares of Winterthur Technologie jumped nearly 7% after the maker of grinding tools agreed to
be acquired by 3M Co. for $448 million.
Early Tuesday in Asia
Asian markets were mixed in early trading, with Tokyo exporters falling on the yen's strength. Japan was off
0.4% and New Zealand fell 0.1%; Australia added 0.5% and South Korea rose 0.3%.

Metals Prices Touch Fresh Peaks --- Gold Settles at a Record While Silver Ends at 30-Year High

Metals Prices Touch Fresh Peaks --- Gold Settles at a Record While Silver Ends at 30-Year High

NEW YORK -- Gold set a record and silver reached a 30-year high Monday as inflation concerns and a
weakening euro gave precious metals extra shine.
Front-month December gold futures settled up $9.90, or 0.7%, at $1,415.30 a troy ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. December silver futures rose 46.40 cents, or 1.6%, to $29.705
an ounce.
Investors rushed into both markets following Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernake's comments to CBS's
"60 Minutes" Sunday, when he said the Fed might increase its $600 billion stimulus effort if necessary to
prevent the economy from lapsing into a second recession.
The program, announced in early November, caused the dollar's value to fall and sparked investor concern
about inflation. Both factors helped gold prices rally to record highs, with silver following on the way up.
Gold is often viewed as a store of value and an inflation hedge, as well as an alternative currency.
"More liquidity means a further boost for precious metals, especially gold, as well as a weaker dollar," Walter
de Wet, head of commodity strategy at Standard Bank, wrote in a note to clients.
Uncertainty surrounding the euro also supported gold and silver prices. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she is against expanding the size of the European Financial Stability Facility, damping sentiment toward
the euro.
Dollar-denominated gold and silver appear more expensive to investors using foreign currencies when the
greenback strengthens. But investors were more concerned about protecting their asset value and hedging
their exposure to currency markets.
Gold came within a few dollars of the $1,424.30 an ounce intraday record set Nov. 9. Silver prices topped
$30 an ounce but were unable to hold at that level.
Silver reached a record $41 an ounce in 1980 when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market.
But silver's run this year could prove more enduring, as prices have risen due to more widespread interest in
the metal. Interest in the metal's futures contracts recently hit a two-year high, and physical silver purchases
have also risen, helping lift prices 70% this year.
Industrial demand for silver is forecast to increase 18% this year, according to industry consultancy GFMS.

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Mixing It Up: Resisting Gold's Glitter --- Adviser Tim
Medley believes stocks will do far better than the precious metal

Despite gold's recent record highs, individual investors shouldn't get swayed into loading up on the metal,
says Tim Medley, a financial adviser in Jackson, Miss.
"Given a choice between first-rate common stocks and gold over the next five to 10 years, I feel strongly that
stocks will do much better," he says.
Mr. Medley says the current euphoria around gold -- it is up 20% over the past year, compared with a gain of
11% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- is similar to what he saw in the early 1980s, when gold
reached record highs. He recalls attending a financial conference back then at which "the room for the lecture
on gold was clearly overflowing." Shortly afterward, gold fell 60% and then went nowhere for the next 20
years. (On an inflation-adjusted basis, gold is still almost 40% below its 1980 peak.)
"There's no utility of gold," Mr. Medley says. "There's no organic growth." He attributes the recent gain in
gold's value to fear. People, he says, are scared because the U.S. has been through a tumultuous period.
But these gains are likely to be short-lived and could reverse if global confidence returns, he says.
In contrast, financially stable companies can grow from a net worth of a few hundred million dollars to a billion
dollars over a few years, boosting their stocks along the way, he says. "We have an opportunity to buy
stocks, both large companies and small companies, at pretty good prices," he says.
Mr. Medley doesn't buy any gold or gold funds for his clients, unless they specifically ask for it. Very few
have, he says. However, some of the funds he owns have a small allocation to stocks of commodity
companies.
In this column, we feature model portfolios from financial advisers who build client portfolios primarily with
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Mr. Medley, a financial planner since 1977, founded Medley &
Brown LLC in 1988. The firm currently manages $365 million, mostly for individuals.
Like millions of others, Mr. Medley's clients are concerned about the possibility of another major stock-market
decline like the most recent one.
"Our caution to them is to not overlearn from 2008," he says. According to data from the 19th century onward,
a stock-market crash like that one tends to happen once in 30 or 40 years, says Mr. Medley. It's "unlikely we'll
see that in the next 15 to 20 years," he says, adding that he actually expects U.S. stock returns to "be above
average" over the next 10 years.
Still, Mr. Medley and his investment team have started to look more at emerging markets as an important
driver of global growth. "We simply buy into the story that the developing world is really going to be an
exciting place to be," says Mr. Medley. Earlier this year, he bought his first emerging-markets fund.
Here he shares a model portfolio for individuals who are five or six years away from retirement. The portfolio
has a weighted average expense ratio of 0.94%, and has returned 17.23% for one year and an average 4.3%
a year over the past 10 years through Oct. 31, according to Mr. Medley.
U.S. STOCKS: There's a 55% allocation to U.S. stocks through 11 mutual funds, and one stock -- Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Mr. Medley says the typical individual investor would do fine owning fewer
funds, but he buys several to diversify the risk of investing too much with any one manager.
Mr. Medley and his investment team look for managers who have historically beaten their benchmarks. "We
try to find wonderful managers and give them the money," says Mr. Medley. "Where they fit in the style box" --
say, a small-cap growth fund or a midcap blend fund -- "is not as important to us as it may be to others."

--- Page 50 ---
Page 50 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But he pays attention to factors such as the managers' ownership of their own funds. Studies show that funds
in which managers have a large personal stake tend to perform better than others, says Mr. Medley. He also
prefers buying funds managed by smaller companies that perhaps specialize in one type of investment,
rather than funds offered by large companies such as Fidelity Investments or banks.
As an example, Mr. Medley allocates 5% of his U.S. stock portion to Skyline Special Equities, whose
managers invest only in small stocks. "We prefer people that really have a focus," says Mr. Medley.
To get exposure to large and medium-size companies, Mr. Medley buys funds such as FMI Large Cap,
Longleaf Partners and Sequoia, which get a 5% allocation each. Mr. Medley held onto his 5% allocation to
Oakmark Select through its 36% loss in 2008 because he believed the firm has a good stock research team.
"They did not all of a sudden become dumb," says Mr. Medley. Oakmark Select rose more than 52% in 2009,
gaining twice as much as the S&P 500.
He owns Keeley All Cap Value, at 4%, because the managers have expertise in buying companies that have
been spun off from larger companies or are coming out of a bankruptcy and restructuring.
Osterweis which gets a 4% allocation, held up better than its benchmark during the downturn, which is what
Mr. Medley expects of the funds he buys. He says he was surprised that many of the other funds he owns
didn't beat their indexes during the downturn because many of them did during the market crash of 2000-02.
For small-company investments, besides the Skyline fund, Mr. Medley allocates 2% to Schneider Small Cap
Value, which he describes as "a volatile fund" because it, too, did poorly in the downturn but also came back
with a bang.
FOREIGN STOCKS: The portfolio has a 32% allocation to foreign stocks.
Five out of the six funds Mr. Medley uses invest a majority of their money in companies of developed foreign
countries but also own some stocks of developing countries. These are: Dodge & Cox International, which
gets a 7% allocation; IVA International, which gets a 5% allocation; and three funds at 6% each: Oakmark
International, Thornburg International Value and Tweedy, Browne Global Value.
The only dedicated emerging-markets fund is Lazard Emerging Markets Equity, at 2%. "We're probably going
to add to that," Mr. Medley says.
BONDS: Unlike many advisers, who have increased their bond allocations to half or more of client portfolios
to protect against a potential decline in stocks, Mr. Medley has stuck with a small bond allocation of just
around 13%. "We just like equities over bonds," because historically, stocks have performed much better, he
says. Besides, he says, he expects interest rates to rise over the next few years, which would hurt bond
prices.
Mr. Medley says that advisers and individuals who are investing heavily in bonds need to be careful about
eroding investors' savings. High-quality intermediate-term bonds are currently yielding around 4%, and after
the adviser's 1% fee, there isn't much left for retired clients to withdraw. "How are you going to make the math
work?" asks Mr. Medley. "Where's the protection from inflation?"
For very conservative clients, or for retired and elderly clients, Mr. Medley raises the bond allocation to
somewhere between 25% and 40%. For clients who are withdrawing from their portfolio for income, Mr.
Medley plans to start putting aside two years of withdrawals in a short-term bond fund as a safety bucket. If
another year comes along when stocks fall 10% to 12%, clients could withdraw from their short-term bond
fund and not have to touch their stocks.
For now, Mr. Medley doesn't have high expectations for his bond allocation. "We expect [to earn] the coupon,
which is 4%," he says.
He allocates 5% to Dodge & Cox Income, 4% to Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade and 3% to
RidgeWorth Intermediate Bond. One percent of the portfolio is in a money-market fund.

Gold Climbs Above $1,400 As Investors Seek Safe Haven

Gold Climbs Above $1,400 As Investors Seek Safe Haven

Gold prices vaulted past the $1,400 mark as weak U.S. jobs data undermined confidence in the dollar,
sending investors searching for safe-haven assets.
Investors rushed into the gold market after government data showed the U.S. economy added just 39,000
jobs last month, against a forecast of 144,000 in a Dow Jones survey. The November unemployment rate
rose to 9.8% from 9.6% in October.
The front-month contract, for December delivery, settled $16.90 higher, or 1.2%, at $1,405.40 a troy ounce on
the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold last settled above $1,400 on Nov. 11. The
December contract's $43 gain this week was the biggest since January.
"Gold is the beneficiary of all that instability in the markets right now," said Scott Meyers, senior trading
analyst with Pioneer Futures division of MF Global. "This recovery is feeble at best, and the trends that are in
place, especially in the metals complex . . . are going to be maintained."
The report revived fears about the health of the U.S. economic recovery and the potential for inflation, as the
data may usher in more monetary easing and low-interest-rate policies from the Federal Reserve. Gold is
considered a hedge against inflation and a safe-harbor investment amid global economic uncertainty.
"The rise in unemployment and the lower jobs number were all against expectations; it suggests to the market
participants that the Fed policy is going to remain easier for longer," said Jeffrey Nichols, managing director
of consultancy American Precious Metals Advisors.
A weaker dollar also boosted gold prices Friday.
In other commodities markets:
WHEAT: Prices have soared on supply concerns, climbing 14% in the past three days. Driving the rally is
demand from importers. Supplies have been shrinking as rains batter crops in eastern Australia, a major
exporter. Soft red winter wheat for December delivery settled up 31.5 cents, or 4.5%, to $7.38 a bushel, the
highest close in two and a half months.

China Buys In to Gold's Allure

China Buys In to Gold's Allure

Gold's record rally has been attributed to everything from worries about inflation, the dollar and the
emergence of exchange-traded funds. One big factor many may have missed: huge buying from China.
Data cited Thursday by China's state-run Xinhua news agency showed that China imported 209.7 metric tons
of gold in the first 10 months of the year, a fivefold increase compared with the same period last year.
That surpassed purchases made by ETFs and surprised analysts, who until now had no clear insight into the
size of China's buying.
Gold demand in general has soared globally this year, as a result of the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and
the U.S. Federal Reserve's new round of bond buying. Gold prices were pushed up to an all-time high of
$1,409.80 a troy ounce on Nov. 9. Thursday, gold rose $1.20, or 0.1%, to settle at $1,388.50, up 27% for the
year.
"Everybody in the gold market knew there was a surge in investment demand, but they didn't know it was
China," said Jeff Christian, managing director at CPM Group.
China's import growth is a reminder of the country's huge but nascent purchasing power.
It comes as the government loosens its restrictions on gold purchases by financial institutions and individual
investors. In August, the country began allowing more banks to import and export gold, opening up the gold
market to the institutions and their clients.
Then this week, the Chinese securities regulator approved the country's first gold fund designed to invest in
overseas-listed gold ETFs, a move analysts interpreted as another bullish sign for gold.
"The big picture is that China is continuing to relax the rules governing the domestic gold market," said Martin
Murenbeeld, chief economist of DundeeWealth Inc., which oversees $69.9 billion in assets. "What we are
seeing is the latent demand that has been there all the time and now can be exercised in the market because
now the market is freed."
The World Gold Council estimates that China's gold demand could double in 10 years as more investors
there embrace precious metals.
Until several years ago, China's gold market was strictly controlled by the central bank, which bought all of
the gold mined domestically. It then sold the metal to jewelry makers. The country, which is now the largest
gold producer, remained largely self-sufficient in gold, with imports at a meager 31 metric tons in 2009,
according to GFMS Ltd.
This year, fears of inflation have driven many Chinese investors to include gold in their portfolios as a store
of value. At the Shanghai Gold Exchange, trading volume increased 43%, to 5,014.5 tons, in the first 10
months of 2010, exchange Chairman Shen Xiangrong said, according to Xinhua.
At a speech at the China Gold and Precious Metals Summit in Shanghai on Thursday, Mr. Shen detailed the
size of China's imports this year, Xinhua said. Those purchases were big enough to absorb all of the gold
that the International Monetary Fund had shed during that time period, which stood at 148.6 tons. It also
dwarfed the SPDR Gold Shares, the world's largest gold-backed ETF, which added 159.48 tons of gold into
its holdings in the same period.
China also is home to a booming gold-mining industry that keeps it as the world's largest gold producer. On
Wednesday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the nation's gold production
reached 277.017 metric tons in the January-to-October period, up 8.8% from the same period last year.

--- Page 53 ---
Page 53 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
China's 2010 gold production is expected at about 350 metric tons, according to Standard Bank head of
commodity strategy Walter de Wet.
"We note that there is likely to be illegal gold exports and imports from and to China," Mr. de Wet said in a
note to clients. "This would distort the actual gold numbers for China. However, the trend is undeniable, gold
demand in China is rising rapidly."
In other commodities markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices settled at a two-year high on Thursday, with oil for January delivery rising $1.25, or 1.4%,
to settle at $88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as economic data in the U.S. and actions in
the euro zone to support debt markets lifted hopes for oil demand. Improving economic conditions in the U.S.,
the world's largest oil consumer, are vital to continuing the drawdown in global supplies that piled up during
the recession.

Why Do We Have a Central Bank?
Why Do We Have a Central Bank?

Why do nations have central banks? Countries have developed without one, and sophisticated financial
systems have evolved in their absence. Some countries with a central bank have suffered for having one.
Zimbabwe comes to mind.
The Federal Reserve System was created by an act of Congress only in 1913. It then presided over a great
wartime inflation followed by a major depression in 1920-21. The 1920s were an era of prosperity, due as
much to Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon's wise fiscal policies as anything the Fed did. The Fed's
performance in the Great Depression was disastrous, a judgment shared by its current chairman, Ben
Bernanke.
The Canadian banking system weathered the Great Depression without a central bank. Instead of the
thousands of small, undiversified banks that the United States had, Canada had a small number of banks
(with many branches across the country) that were able withstand localized downturns. Even in the Great
Depression, banking failures in the U.S. were concentrated in specific regions. Canada's central bank, the
Bank of Canada, was created in 1935 in part because of pressure from the rest of the world. Canada had
survived without it quite well.
In short, central banking has been neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of a modern economy
and financial system. A number of reform proposals for the Fed are being crafted, but there is no agreement
on why the institution exists.
Policy makers are debating the wisdom of the Fed's dual mandate of providing price stability and full
employment. Rep. Mike Pence (R., Ind.) has introduced a bill to amend the Federal Reserve Act to end the
dual mandate and give the Fed one goal: maintaining price stability (H.R. 6406). The dual mandate is seen
by many as giving the Fed an impossible assignment of simultaneously optimizing two variables with one
policy tool. It is also not clear that a central bank is capable of maintaining full employment.
Yet maintaining stable prices was not part of the Fed's original mandate and, aside from some economists,
few thought it the Fed's job. The gold standard provided for stable prices over time, and the Fed's job was to
maintain that standard (which does not require a central bank).
In the 19th century, the eminent British economist and journalist Walter Bagehot wrote "Lombard Street: A
Description of the Money Market" as a treatise on the best central bank practice. Bagehot observed that the
existence of the Bank of England centralized reserves in that institution. He preferred that banks provide for
their own liquidity by holding a buffer of short-term marketable assets.
Bagehot's goal was to devise central bank policy so that commercial banks would behave in ordinary times
as if there were no central bank. In a liquidity crisis, commercial banks would turn to the Bank of England for
support. That function, known as the lender of last resort, is the one carry-over to the Fed and all other
central banks today. It appeared in the Federal Reserve Act as providing for an "elastic" currency, i.e., one
whose quantity could grow or shrink at the Fed's discretion.
The Fed's first round of quantitative easing (printing money) was in response to the liquidity crisis of autumn
2008, which occurred in the wake of the Sept. 15 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. It is not clear if QE was still
needed by the time it was implemented at the end of 2008. It was likely too large and went on for too long.
The Fed also forgot Bagehot's dictum that a central bank should lend only on good assets at penalty
interest rates. The latter principle was to ensure that emergency lending did not become a subsidy program.
Economists will debate the episode for many years.
There is no liquidity crisis now, however, and no justification for continued lender-of-last-resort activity. There
are quite possibly still large unrecognized losses on banks' balance sheets associated with the housing

--- Page 55 ---
Page 55 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
collapse and other unwise lending. These losses mean such institutions are in reality undercapitalized, not
short of liquidity.
The Fed's critics increasingly see it as acting as an unelected fiscal authority. Its lending to select institutions
constitutes credit allocation and surreptitious bailouts of large banks. Its policy of low interest rates is part of
its bank support program.
Meanwhile, the economy suffers because none of the Fed's policies will fix the banking system. The failure to
fix the banks, not a nonexistent deflation threat, is what calls into mind Japan's lost decade of the 1990s.
Banks with large, unrecognized losses will not make new loans while losses from the old ones grow.
Regulators should be consistent in calling for banks to write down assets and recapitalize themselves (and
not just apply the policy to smaller institutions that are being closed). Now is not the time for banks to raise
dividends, as numerous large banks are seeking to do. Now is the time to raise capital. In the meantime, the
Fed must stop conducting fiscal policy under the guise of monetary policy. Taxpayer bailouts of weakened
banks would be a terrible idea. But, if done by Congress, it would at least be subject to democratic debate
and be conducted in the open.
The Fed has been ceded a degree of operational independence by Congress to conduct monetary policy.
That independence is viable only so long as the Fed sticks to conventional monetary policy. If it persists in
acting also as a fiscal authority, ordinary citizens and their representatives are going to ask: Why do we have
a central bank?

HONG KONG -- China's securities regulators are allowing mainland Chinese to invest in foreign
exchange-traded gold funds for the first time, unleashing the full buying power of the world's second-biggest
economy on funds that already own more gold than most central banks.
Gold prices jumped Tuesday, as interest in gold ETFs could be strong from China, where investors face
negative real interest rates on bank deposits and want to hedge against inflation.
Lion Fund Management Co. received permission to invest in exchange-traded gold funds outside the
country, making the fund the first of its kind for mainland China, according to a statement posted on the
Shenzhen fund provider's website.
The new rules open ETFs like the $56 billion SPDR Gold Shares, the largest private owner of physical gold,
to a potentially enormous new pool of investors.
Lion Fund's announcement sent gold prices to a two-week high Tuesday, with the December contract gaining
$19, or 1.4%, to settle at $1,385 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The move to approve foreign ETFs is the latest step in the expansion of the gold market in China, the world's
second-largest gold consumer behind India, and the top producer of the metal.

Inside the Nixon Administration:
The Secret Diary of Arthur Burns

(University Press of Kansas, 140 pages, $24.95)
In the midst of the current crisis -- with the dollar having collapsed to barely more than a 1,400th of the value
of an ounce of gold, the United Nations calling for a new world currency and Ben Bernanke becoming a
political punching bag for the "quantitative easing" that critics fear will ignite inflation -- we now have a book
containing the secret diaries of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board during Richard Nixon's
presidency, a time of turmoil in currencies and markets and of policies that haunt our economy to this day.
Arthur Burns, the pipe-puffing ex-Columbia professor who served as Fed chairman under Presidents Nixon,
Ford and Carter, turns out to have kept a diary between 1969, shortly before he became the 10th chairman of
the Fed, and 1974, when President Nixon resigned. The diary was given by Burns's widow, Helen, to the
Gerald Ford Presidential Library and released for publication in 2008. The scoop -- "Inside the Nixon
Administration: The Secret Diary of Arthur Burns" -- is edited by Robert H. Ferrell, a scholar of American
history.
The diary covers five of the most astounding years in monetary history. They encompass the collapse of the
Bretton Woods system, under which foreign governments could redeem their dollars with our government for
gold; the closing of the gold window, ending such convertibility; the imposition of wage-and-price controls,
supposedly to stanch inflation; and an import surcharge. They saw the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement,
an attempt to stabilize things by devaluing the dollar, and then the beginning of the great inflation, during
which the dollar lost much of its value, falling, by early 1980, to less than an 800th of an ounce of gold from
the 35th of an ounce it had been set at under Bretton Woods.
Burns's "secret diary" isn't likely to make big headlines in this era of Wikileaks. Nor is it intended to offer a
complete or coherent narrative of these events. But for those with an eye on today's monetary debate, it is a
little gem of a volume, offering brief, occasionally trenchant, sometimes galling insights, with lots of waspish
comments about various figures within and around the White House. These start with the president himself,
who, in the early entries, is treated in warm and respectful terms.
When he is still serving as a presidential counselor, just ahead of his Fed appointment, Burns writes of Nixon:
"He clearly likes his job. He wants to be a good president, really a president of all the people. I can hardly
recall a single partisan utterance." But by the middle of the book he is writing: "The President's preoccupation
with the election frightens me. Is there anything he would not do to further his reelection? I am losing faith in
him, and my heart is sick and sad."
On members of the administration Burns can be caustic. Henry Kissinger is "admittedly ignorant of
economics." John Connally, who for part of the period is Treasury secretary, is "a thoroughly confused
politician." George Shultz, who would follow Connally at Treasury, is described as "a no less confused
amateur economist," though he rises in Burns's estimation as the years go on.
Not that Burns comes out much better, even in his own view. At one point he writes, in the diary's clipped
prose, that he is "the only one there with any knowledge of the subject, but even I not a real expert on some
aspects of the intricate international problem!" So it turned out. He seems throughout his own diary to grasp
that inflation is not the way out of America's underperforming economy but to be unable -- even as chairman
of the Fed -- to put his foot down.

At the time there were observers outside the White House -- not least Henry Hazlitt, a New York Times
editorial writer in the 1940s -- who had warned from the beginning that Bretton Woods as a system was
inherently inflationary and, not to put too fine a point on it, doomed. "Inside the Nixon Administration" gives
the impression that, when it came to monetary policy, Nixon, Shultz, Connally and Burns himself were but
corks on the water, carried along by economic forces larger than themselves.
If Burns's diary is a guide, none of these figures thought about money in terms of the Constitution. There is no
reference here to the fact that the Founders thought of the dollar as a fixed amount of silver or its free-market
equivalent in gold. Nixon and Burns let go of the American currency in a series of small decisions. At one
point the chairman of the Federal Reserve writes that he would be for a price freeze -- "but only for 30 days."
Burns comes off as relatively conservative figure, but also weak. "My efforts to prevent the closing of the gold
window -- working with Connally, [Paul] Volcker, and Shultz -- do not seem to have succeeded," he writes on
Aug. 12, 1971, three days before the event. "The gold window may have to be closed tomorrow because we
now have a government that seems incapable, not only of constructive leadership, but of any action at all.
What a tragedy for mankind!"
So here were are now in a new crisis, with a different chairman at the Fed, preparing to pump hundreds of
billions of dollars into the economy as part of a desperate effort to boost demand and keep the economy from
going back into recession. One wonders whether Ben Bernanke is keeping his own "secret diary." Burns's
was kept in two spiral notebooks, one of which, this volume tells us, cost 49 cents. Today similar notebooks
are listed at Staples.com at $5.49. They are similar, at the moment, to the Federal Reserve's one-dollar bills
-- worth but slightly more than the paper they're printed on.

Increasing Tensions Boost Dollar's Allure

NEW YORK -- The dollar reached a two-month high against its major rivals Friday as investors reacted to
fresh signs of trouble in the euro zone and worried about escalating tensions on the Korean peninsula.
The euro slipped as low as $1.3200 on deepening worries about the area's sovereign-debt crisis. Against the
Japanese currency, the dollar rose above the 84 yen mark for the first time since late September.
Reflecting the U.S. currency's increasing allure as a safe harbor in times of stress, the dollar gained nearly
0.9% on the euro following a report in Friday's Financial Times Deutschland that euro-zone countries and the
European Central Bank are applying pressure on Portugal to accept aid akin to Ireland's discussed rescue
package.
Portugal, Spain and the European Commission officials denied the report. But growing market speculation
that Portugal may be the next country to ask for support from its euro-zone neighbors has rocked confidence
in the common currency, several analysts said.
News from the euro zone "highlights the fact the fear of contagion is moving to reality," said Camilla Sutton,
currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto.
There has also been an accelerating shift to the dollar from the yen because of Japan's proximity to the
unfolding conflict on the Korean peninsula, analysts said. The dollar had been under pressure against the
yen, so the new trend marks a significant reversal, said Steven Englander, head of G10 strategy at Citigroup
in New York.
Late Friday afternoon, the euro was at $1.3248, down from $1.3355 from late Thursday. The dollar was at
84.10 yen from 83.61 yen, while the euro was at 111.43 yen from 111.66 yen. The U.K. pound was at
$1.5594 from $1.5763. The dollar was at 0.9972 Swiss francs from 0.9991.
The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, was at
80.357 from 79.640.
"[A] symphony of negative headlines" from across the world fed a broad move into the dollar across currency
pairs, said Mark McCormick, currency strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
The Australian dollar sold off roughly 1.7% against the U.S. dollar. That followed comments from Glenn
Stevens, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said analysts. He said no further rate increases are
being considered in the near term during testimony to Parliament.
That stoked concern that a commodity-driven Chinese global-growth-led economy may be cooling off, a
negative omen for a global recovery in general, said the analysts. The RBA comments "highlight the fact that
the global recovery is slowing and most countries will probably hold off on (raising) interest rates now," Ms.
Sutton said.
Sterling also traded down by 1% to new two-month lows against the dollar. The dollar traded near two-month
highs against the Swiss franc.
The U.K. economy is inextricably linked to the roiled euro zone and investors are punishing sterling for this
correlation, said Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon in London. Specifically,
"there is huge exposure by the U.K. banking sector," to Irish government debt, she said.
The strong move into the dollar has created a move away from other safe-haven assets, which include the
Swiss franc and gold, Ms. Komileva said.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Year-End Tax Moves

[Uncertainty in Washington Is Creating Confusion for Investors Trying to Minimize Their Tax Burden. Here's
What You Need to Know -- and Do -- Now]
There are plenty of reasons for taxpayers to scream. Here it is, year-end tax-planning time, when investors
must decide whether to take gains or harvest losses and make important retirement-account choices. Yet
crucial questions remain -- not only about next year's tax law but also about this year's.
If Congress doesn't pass an extension of the Bush-era tax rates for upper-income earners, the top rate on
long-term capital gains will rise by one-third next year -- an increase that is double the rise in rates on
ordinary income. The rate on dividends, meanwhile, could nearly triple. And many taxpayers are still waiting
for answers on the 2010 alternative minimum tax, the estate tax and the gift tax.
Adding to taxpayers' anxiety, two serious overhaul proposals were just announced in Washington -- one from
President Obama's deficit commission and the other from the independent Bipartisan Policy Center. While it
is unlikely they would be enacted in current form, they take aim at many prized benefits, from the
mortgage-interest deduction to low capital-gains rates. It's natural to fear that moves made now could prove
useless later, or even backfire.
Given all the uncertainty, is your annual year-end tax-planning session worth the effort this year? Yes -- in
fact it is crucial, because it could be your last chance to take advantage of today's low rates.
Congress will address taxes in December, and may (or may not) clear up 2010 and 2011 issues before
year-end. Advisers like Mark Nash of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in Dallas are urging clients to get ready
to pounce once the law becomes clear. "We are making plans [for clients] now that can be executed quickly
before the end of the year, or looking at moves -- like Roth IRA conversions or installment-sale elections --
that can be revised next year," he says.
Even if Congress merely extends current law, understanding "wash sale" rules, loss-harvesting and Roth IRA
conversions now can pay off later.
That is because the window is closing on current investment tax rates, now at historic lows. Already, many
investors face a substantial tax increase in 2013 passed by Congress as part of the health-care overhaul.
Every financial and political analyst interviewed for this story expects taxes on investments to rise more than
taxes on wages in coming years.
The good news? Investors have enviable flexibility when it comes to timing income and deducting losses --
far more than wage earners. There's so much to say about investment tax planning that we're saving other
year-end tips for next week.
Capital Gains and Losses
If Congress extends the Bush 2001-03 tax rates for couples earning more than $250,000 ($200,000 for
singles), then the top rate on long-term capital gains (those held longer than a year) will remain 15% for a
year or two. If lawmakers don't extend the current law, then on Jan. 1 the top rate on gains will rise to 20%.
Whatever the outcome, a new 3.8% tax on investment income takes effect in 2013 as a result of the
health-care overhaul. It applies to income from rents, royalties, dividends, capital gains and interest (except
municipal-bond interest) for nearly everyone with adjusted gross incomes over $250,000 ($200,000 for
singles). (For details, see "How the New Wealth Taxes Will Hit You," June 12.)
What you can do. People with liquid investments should prepare to act quickly this year if the Bush cuts aren't
extended, or later if they are. That means understanding some important details of current law.

--- Page 62 ---

-- Loss harvesting. If you sell an investment at a loss, you can use up to $3,000 per year of the loss to offset
ordinary income like wages and "carry forward" the rest to shelter future investment gains. (Note: These rules
apply only to investments held in taxable accounts, not tax-sheltered retirement plans such as individual
retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.) Short-term losses are those from investments held a year or less, and
long-term losses are from those held longer.
The rules on overall gains and losses are intricate but give investors room to optimize results. "Smart
investors pay close attention to the timing of gains and losses in order to minimize taxes," says independent
tax analyst Robert Willens.
If tax rates rise next year, it may make sense to hold off taking losses until January, when their value will be
greater. On the other hand, many investors still have losses they took during the terrible downturn of 2008. If
they can take short-term gains this year, Mr. Willens suggests doing so to use some of those losses. This can
often work with proper planning.
Why use the losses this year instead of next if tax rates are going up? Although the losses would in theory be
more valuable next year, Mr. Willens and others usually advise using them as soon as possible, because the
market could change and waiting too long could erode their value.
Here's an example. Susan has $40,000 of losses left from 2008. This year, she has $50,000 of potential
gains: $30,000 is long-term and $20,000 is short-term. She wants to use her loss and is worried about the
prospects of the stock with the short-term gain. So she sells all the stock with the $20,000 short-term gain
and enough of the long-term holding to realize $17,000 of gain.
The result: $37,000 of short- and long-term gains are sheltered this year, with $3,000 of losses left to offset
her wage income. Why save $3,000 of the loss to offset wages? Because ordinary income is taxed at much
higher rates than long-term gains, it's a more lucrative offset.
-- Understand the wash-sale rules. If you sell an investment at a loss, you don't get the loss if you also buy
the same holding 30 days before or after the sale. What many don't know is that these rules apply only to
losses, not to gains. In the above example, Susan was free to re-acquire the stock she sold right away at a
higher cost basis, which will reduce her taxable gain in the future. As long as transaction costs are low, it
often makes sense to "scrub" your gains if you have losses.
-- Mix and match. When reckoning gains and losses, remember that those on mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds can offset gains from stocks, and vice versa.
Tax strategist Robert Gordon of Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York notes that many taxable bonds
have appreciated as interest rates have fallen. If an investor holds individual bonds with long-term gains, he
suggests selling the bonds, in effect converting interest payments taxable at ordinary rates to long-term
capital gains with a top rate of 15%. If the investor buys the bond back right away, he should elect to deduct
the premium from the interest payments over the remaining life of the bond.
What if you are selling an entire business instead of a liquid investment? Many are pushing to finish deals
before the end of the year, says Mr. Nash. Failing that, he says, some people with deals under way are
selling the business to a trust before the end of the year to take advantage of the 15% rate, and letting the
trust sell it next year. This is a complex move but could be useful this year for people selling substantial
assets who have a buyer.
Dividends
If lawmakers extend the Bush 2001-03 tax cuts for upper-end taxpayers, the top rate on dividends will remain
15%. If they don't, the top rate may stay linked with the one for capital gains and rise to 20% (as requested by
the Obama budget), or dividends will once again be treated as ordinary income, with a top rate of 39.6%.
What you can do. Individual investors can do little. Those who control companies can have them pay
dividends before the end of the year. Several public companies, including Wynn Resorts Ltd., Limited Brands
Inc. and Progressive Corp., have paid special or extraordinary dividends recently, ahead of possible changes
next year.
Stock Options and Restricted Shares
So-called nonqualified stock options and restricted stock are now the most common forms of executive stock
compensation. Employees who receive either type usually owe ordinary income taxes and payroll taxes
(FICA) on the stock's value at current market prices when they exercise the options or the restricted stock
vests. If they continue to hold shares more than a year after that, appreciation is taxed at long-term
capital-gains rates, without payroll taxes.

--- Page 63 ---
Page 63 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
If the Bush tax cuts aren't extended for all, the top rate on ordinary income will rise to 39.6% from 35% and on
capital gains to 20% from 15%. In addition, there is the new 3.8% tax on investment income (described
above) coming in 2013. The 2013 tax also adds a 0.9% payroll tax to the wages of couples making over
$250,000 ($200,000 for singles). It would apply to income recognized when options are exercised or
restricted stock vests.
What you can do. Plan not only for this year but also the next two, with the 2013 taxes in view. There is a lot
to consider: ordinary tax rates, capital gain rates and holding periods, plus the stock's current price and its
future prospects.
Eddie Adkins, a benefits specialist with Grant Thornton LLP, says he sees savvy executives planning now to
avoid the 2013 increases. Because it may be hard to come up with the cash required to acquire shares or pay
taxes, many are doing "cashless" transactions in which some shares are sold in order to cover the costs of
keeping others, he says.
One caveat: The wash-sale rules (described above) come into play here. A grant of options or restricted
stock, or an option exercise, count as buying stock, so be careful not to harvest losses from the same stock
within 30 days before or after.
Roth IRA Conversions
Roth IRAs are in many ways the gold standard of retirement accounts. Assets in them can grow and be paid
out income-tax-free, and there are no mandatory distributions for the owner, as there are with regular IRAs.
Tax-free Roth payouts don't count in calculations for alternative minimum tax, Social Security tax, Medicare
premiums or the 3.8% investment income tax coming in 2013, at least for now.
This is the first year all taxpayers may convert other IRAs to Roth accounts regardless of their income. Many
have jumped to do it, even though that means paying full income taxes on the transfer. Roth sponsors have
experienced a surge, with Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group reporting four to five times the number of
conversions as of this time last year.
A key Roth boon is that people who convert can reverse the transaction as late as Oct. 15 of the following
year. This has led some to put different asset classes into separate Roth accounts with plans to undo the
ones that have lost value or grown less. (See Tax Report, Aug. 14.) For 2010 only, investors may also split
the conversion income and report half in 2011 and half in 2012, paying taxes at then-current rates. If the Bush
cuts are extended, taking advantage of the deferral could make sense.
What you can do. Remember that Roth conversions work best when the following are true: Your tax rate will
be the same or higher in the future; asset values have been beaten down; you have outside money to pay the
tax; and you can transfer assets without moving into a higher tax bracket. In some cases, a conversion that
raises income may help you avoid the alternative minimum tax.
Even a small conversion will start an important five-year clock running. Once the five years is up, Roth
payouts of both principal and earnings are tax-free for those over 59 1/2; if not, only payouts of principal are
tax-free until five years is up. A December conversion starts this clock running as of the previous January.
But January is often a good time to convert to a Roth IRA, because this leaves the longest possible time to
undo the conversion: almost 22 months. Those who convert in January 2011 will have almost until the 2012
elections to decide whether to undo the transfer.
Many taxpayers fear that if they pay to convert, Congress will change the rules in the future. The issues are
many, but at least one expert familiar with tax theory and history, Columbia University Law School Professor
Michael Graetz, plans a partial Roth conversion early next year.
"Waiting until next year gives until October 2012 to undo the conversion, and we should know more about
where Congress is heading," says Prof. Graetz.
For one group of taxpayers who want to save for retirement -- those who don't have current IRAs -- a Roth
conversion is close to a no-brainer. These investors can open a "nondeductible" IRA, put in up to $5,000 --
$6,000 if they're at least 50 -- and immediately convert to a Roth IRA with little or no tax.
This strategy doesn't work well for those who already have large IRAs, unless they're converting all their
accounts. That's because partial conversions have to be prorated among pretax and after-tax IRAs.
PricewaterhouseCoopers's Mr. Nash notes that this move can work for executives who have earned too
much to have a deductible IRA, and sometimes their spouses as well.

Behind Gold's New Glister: Miners' Big Bet on a Fund
Behind Gold's New Glister: Miners' Big Bet on a Fund

The innovation that opened gold investing to the masses and helped spur this year's record-breaking bull
market was hatched in an act of desperation by a little-known gold-mining trade group.
The World Gold Council, created to promote gold, was fighting for survival. Its members -- global
gold-mining companies -- were frustrated with the council's inability to stem two decades of depressed prices
and find buyers for a growing glut of the yellow metal. Eight years ago, they were considering withdrawing
funding from the trade group, a move that would have effectively shut it down.
Chris Thompson, the group's chairman, figured the council needed to expand the pool of gold buyers,
particularly in the U.S. The idea of trading gold on an exchange had been floating around for years, but
various hurdles had prevented it from taking off in America.
What the council eventually managed to create in those dark days surpassed its wildest dreams: SPDR Gold
Shares, the exchange-traded fund launched in November 2004. The fund, known by its ticker symbol GLD,
has ballooned into a $56.7 billion behemoth.
Today, GLD is the fastest-growing major investment fund ever, according to research company Lipper Inc.,
and one of the most active gold traders in the market. Its presence has helped gold -- which settled down
0.33% in New York trading Wednesday, at $1,372.90 a troy ounce -- triple in price in recent years to fresh
all-time highs this month.
As the world's largest private owner of bullion, GLD is soaking up $30 million of gold daily, stored in a London
vault that now holds the equivalent of about six months' worth of the world's entire gold-mining production.
GLD has won fans who say it has democratized the gold market, paving the way for investors of all stripes to
get direct exposure to the precious metal. Its nearly 1 million investors include ordinary individuals, institutions
like Northern Trust Corp. and billionaire hedge-fund managers like John Paulson.
But skeptics argue GLD could become a Godzilla-like beast if the gold rally reverses sharply. They say its
buying has already turbo-charged gold prices, exposing the market, and legions of small investors, to a rapid
fall. Smaller copycat funds add to the risk.
"We tell our clients to watch out for it, because it's there, and it's a real risk," said Jeffrey Christian, founder of
CPM Group, which advises major investors worldwide on gold.
The questions come as ETFs in general are coming under heightened scrutiny about whether they distort
markets. ETFs are wildly popular and growing fast, spanning stocks, bonds and hard assets. But they have
made it possible for far more money to rush in and out of previously illiquid markets.
GLD shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico
City. Each share represents one-tenth of an ounce of gold. That, in effect, gives shareholders the right to
their share of proceeds from selling a full bar, minus fees. Before GLD issues new shares, it takes in the
necessary gold to back them. On days when there are more sellers than buyers of GLD shares, the fund
offloads some of its gold.
Created under the auspices of the World Gold Council, the fund relies on a number of partners. It is marketed
under the banner of State Street Global Advisors, which has fund-selling expertise. HSBC PLC stores and
protects the gold bars. Bank of New York Mellon Corp. handles daily operations, such as calculating the
fund's net asset value. For all its size and breadth, fund managers say, it's relatively simple to operate. BNY
Mellon, for instance, needs roughly a dozen employees to run the fund day-to-day.
That has helped make it a windfall for all involved. The gold council, which spent $14 million developing the
fund, has reaped about $150 million from its inception through Sept. 30. Its revenue is a percentage of net

--- Page 65 ---
Page 65 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
asset value, set at 0.15%. State Street has the same terms and also collected about $150 million in that time.
Both are on track to bring in more than $80 million in the coming year if GLD stays at today's size.
The success owes much to timing. The council launched the fund as interest in gold was picking up, first
because of inflation worries and then as a safe-haven against financial disasters. Since then gold prices
have more than tripled from $444.80, setting a record high -- though not adjusted for inflation -- of $1,409.80
on Nov. 9.
The recent rally has been driven by many factors, of which GLD is just one. The U.S. dollar has steadily lost
value, so some investors have bought gold as a hedge against the greenback. Tapping new ore veins is
getting harder. Gold has benefited at once from fears of economic stagnation after the financial crisis and
concern that government spending on the recovery will trigger inflation.
GLD, though, is widely seen as amplifying those trends.
Buying fund shares is easier and cheaper than investing in gold futures or buying coins. And GLD has now
locked up nearly 1,300 metric tons of the world's gold supply, making the market tighter. The fund's impact
has won it a following in the gold industry.
"It's got the gold price up," said Nick Holland, chief executive of Gold Fields Ltd., a major mining company
and a member of the gold council. "That's got to be good."
Calculating the impact of GLD and its brethren is far from an exact science. But industry observers including
Mr. Christian and Philip Klapwijk of GFMS Ltd. estimate gold-backed ETFs have probably added about $100
to $150 an ounce to the price of gold as a result of the incremental increase in demand.
Translated, that would mean gold-backed ETFs have increased the value of the bullion that gold miners will
produce this year by up to $9 billion.
Many investors believe gold has much further to rise. But after a 10-year, one-way ride, others worry there
could be a violent reversal down the road. The gold market hasn't been severely tested since GLD and
similar, but far smaller, bullion-backed funds were launched.
And many GLD investors aren't experienced in gold investing. Between 60% and 80% of GLD investors had
never bought gold before, estimates Jason Toussaint, managing director of the council. No one knows how
those newcomers might react in a sharp downturn.
If GLD shareholders get spooked by drops in the gold price and sell en masse, the fund would have to dump
metal to meet redemptions, possibly accelerating declines by prompting others to sell even more. Because
GLD trades on an exchange, any selloff would be immediately visible, unlike typically opaque bullion sales.
"We are more concerned about these issues than we were initially," said Scott Malpass, chief investment
officer for University of Notre Dame Asset Management, which started buying GLD shares in 2005 and now
has about $70 million invested. "It can turn on a dime. It can happen very quickly." For now, Mr. Malpass
thinks the advantages of investing in gold outweigh the risks and the fund is properly managed.
In the fund's planning stages, the world's miners had modest ambitions.
Gold prices were just starting to stir from a 20-year bear market and many companies were struggling to
break even. Hurdles to gold abounded. It was hard to purchase, store and insure. Some investors chose to
own stocks of gold miners.
The council had long focused on gold jewelry, which represented over 80% of demand but exposed the
industry to economic downturns. In 2002, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, jewelry demand for gold
dropped 11%.
Attracting investors, the industry concluded, was the way to go. Mr. Thompson, the chairman, wanted a CEO
for the council who would have credibility with American investors to help implement the vision. He zeroed in
on James Burton, who at the time headed the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the
biggest institutional investors in the world. Calpers had no direct investments in gold.
In July 2002, Mr. Burton flew to meet Mr. Thompson in London. Mr. Burton was skeptical, but curious. Their
discussions lasted 12 hours -- including talks over a round of golf, two rounds of beers and meals. Mr.
Thompson gave an overview of the gold market, and a pitch for why the moment was ripe to attract retail
investors. By the end, Mr. Burton was hooked.
In August 2002, Mr. Burton, who had left Calpers, took over the gold council and immediately slashed 60% of
the 108-person staff, closed half of the 22 offices and set about creating what became GLD.

The gold council wanted a product that ordinary investors could buy and sell just like a stock. The challenge
was to make shares track the gold price, much like an index fund. The eventual solution was to create a trust
to serve as the legal owner of GLD's gold bars.
Products were launched in Australia and the U.K. But getting a U.S. version took longer than the council
expected.
The mining community backed the idea, but worried it might cannibalize demand for gold-mining stocks.
Since it was to be the first U.S. fund entirely backed by a physical commodity, regulators also sought to
understand how the concept would work. The Securities and Exchange Commission spent months seeking
information about the product and the gold market, say Mr. Burton and Mr. Thompson.
The gold council also needed to hire assorted players -- a trustee, a marketing agent and a vault operator.
That process wasn't seamless, either.
Barclays PLC worked for months on the project, then withdrew and built its own fund, the iShares Gold Trust,
which also holds bullion. Barclays sold the iShares exchange-traded fund business to BlackRock in June
2009, and its smaller gold fund has since become an intense competitor.
The council also wasn't sure how successful the fund would be, and paid UBS Securities $4 million for
underwriting the first 2.3 million shares of GLD, according to regulatory filings. UBS declined to comment.
"I thought it would take a lot more marketing effort to convince people to buy gold in a securitized form," said
Mr. Burton.
But as GLD opened, the pent-up investor demand erupted. The fund hit $1 billion in assets in three trading
days, and $10 billion in just over two years.
"It grew pretty quickly," said Jim Ross, head of exchange-traded funds for State Street. The firm manages
120 exchange-traded funds, as of Sept. 30, and the SPDR S&P 500 fund is the only one larger than GLD.
"The fact that's our second-most successful product is still surprising to me, frankly," Mr. Ross said.
The sniping at GLD also began early. Some gold investors questioned whether the fund held as much bullion
as it said it did, eventually prompting the council to post on its website audit reports by an independent firm,
Inspectorate International Ltd., which conducts two counts each year of GLD's gold bars in London.
A segment of the gold-investing community still prefers to secure a personal stash. Some want to be able to
get their hands on their bullion in a hurry, particularly in the event of a severe crisis. Gold-vault operators are
cutting fees to lure such investors.
Rivals also highlight worst-case scenarios the fund could face. Ben Davies, chief executive of London-based
Hinde Capital, which oversees a gold fund, noted that GLD's bullion isn't insured. If the gold "is lost,
damaged, stolen or destroyed," the trust "may not have adequate sources of recovery," according to the
prospectus.
Mr. Toussaint said the council believes HSBC's security measures and the bank's other liability coverage
provide protection. "That's the whole reason we put it in a vault in the first place," he said.
Despite GLD's success, even those involved in the fund acknowledge the rally will eventually end. "We don't
believe gold is always going to go up," said State Street's Mr. Ross. "No investment does."

Heard & Scene: At the Financial Follies, It Was 'Raining Yen'
Heard & Scene: At the Financial Follies, It Was 'Raining Yen'
By Marshall Heyman

No doubt someone made this joke last November and has made it many, many Novembers before that, but
the Financial Follies is probably an apt name for the year in business. This is probably why the Financial
Follies was named as such when it was founded 72 years ago, but it seems especially clever in 2010.
The first Financial Follies, which is now thrown annually by the New York Financial Writers Association, took
place on Dec. 16, 1938 at the Hotel Astor on 45th and Broadway. Tickets were $10 and the show ran three
hours.
Friday was the 68th Financial Follies. (It wasn't performed during WWII.) It took place, as it has since 1997, at
the Marriott Marquis. Tickets now cost $400 a pop. How's that for inflation? Beneficiaries include the
NYFWA's educational programs and a scholarship fund for aspiring business writers.
Though this analogy might be lost on the business community, here goes: the Financial Follies is sort of like
"Forbidden Broadway." That is, if "Forbidden Broadway" was making fun of financial trends rather than
over-the-top theater folk, and developed by professional business people instead of professional actors. And,
if it was accompanied by an autumnal meal of heirloom squash soup, field green salad with toasted pumpkin
seeds and apple balsamic vinaigrette, and roasted beef tenderloin, polenta fries and French beans with
shallot marmalade.
Because it's a staged show, the Financial Follies has what it calls a book and lyrics committee. Some of the
people on the committee this year were Josh Friedlander, who's the President Emeritus of NYFWA and the
online editor of AR: Absolute Return + Alpha; Peter Coy, the economics editor for BusinessWeek; and
Imogen Rose-Smith, a reporter for Institutional Investor.
This year's cast was made of an equally eclectic crowd, including reporters from Market News International
and Reuters, as well as professional actors like Tim Kubart, who appeared as a character named Spencer in
the Teen.com Web series "Haute & Bothered." Accompaniment is provided by Broadway musicians.
The program featured a cautionary warning containing its own brand of fiscal ha-ha: "This show's humor is an
unregulated derivative of past events. Pursue an investment at your own risk. Past hilarity is no guarantee of
future humor."
Featured prominently: an illustration of President Obama, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and
Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner among dolphins and fish in the oil spill, and included Goldman Sachs
CEO Lloyd Blankfein dressed like Lady Gaga.
This wasn't, of course, the only Lady Gaga joke, because if nothing else the NYFWA understands the
Zeitgest. Like in any good financial satire, there was a number paying homage to Gilbert & Sullivan. It was
called "Never Never Slick at Sea" and it was sung to the tune of "I Am the Captain of the Pinafore." "Deck the
halls with boughs of holly" was transformed into "Deck the halls with boughs of folly." "It's Raining Men"
became "It's Raining Yen." A parody morphed Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" to "Don't Stop Deceiving."
Where was the Gaga, you ask? Well, performers wearing lots of orange and gold latexlike outfits sang "Bad
Finance," a variation, of course, on the hit song "Bad Romance."
Some sample lyrics, beause you know you're itching for them: "Rah rah ah-ah-ah!/Ro mah
ro-mah-mah!/Goldman Ooh la la!/Want more bad finance/We want your money/we've got the disease/We'd
sell you anything/That comes with a fee." Okay, so it's not "Hairspray."
"They take it very seriously, and they actually make you rehearse a lot," said Ali Velshi, a CNN reporter who's
been attending the Financial Follies "since I lost my hair" and has even performed with the troupe. "I once
wore a sequin and velvet outfit and sang 'The Best is Yet to Come.' I'm glad it was before YouTube."

Pat Kiernan, the morning anchor for NY1, reminded Mr. Velshi that he had also appeared as Carmen
Miranda. "He used to have to skip out on lunches early so he could go practice," Mr. Kiernan recalled. "Once
a week of practices for the entire fall. It's a commitment. There's some brilliant satire here. It makes you wish
it could be for a bigger audience. But no -- never. I would never perform."

Commodities Whipsaw Investors
Abreast of the Market
Commodities Whipsaw Investors

If this month has felt like a wild ride for stock investors, it has been positively hair-raising for those in the
commodities market.
Price swings for raw materials reached the highest levels in more than a year as investors initially celebrated
the prospect of U.S. monetary easing and then panicked at the possibility China would be too severe in its
attempts to cool its economy.
Prices of everything from gold to copper and cotton leapt to new highs, only to be slapped down just as
quickly. Trading volume in many commodities roared to records, including for silver, cotton and corn.
Since the beginning of October, the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index's 30-day realized volatility has
doubled to 25%, the highest since September 2009.
The moves were particularly striking because stock-market volatility has been relatively benign, even with
triple-digit moves in the past few sessions. The same measure of 30-day volatility in the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index is near six-month lows.
For commodities, the overarching reason for the volatility is the outsize reaction to new signs that China has
stepped up its moves to tighten credit and contain inflation. But the huge amount of money flooding into
commodities markets appears to be helping exaggerate those moves.
With that money has come a new breed of investors more focused on trading in and out of commodities to
profit from price moves rather than the standard producers and consumers relying on the market to manage
their risks.
Since August, money managers, such as hedge funds, have raised their bullish bets on oil, copper, soybeans
and many other markets. These funds' total net-long positions all peaked in the week ended Nov. 9, before
being cut in the past week, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
All this suggests volatility will at least be around, if not increase, in the short term, even if many people
believe commodities overall have a lot further to rally.
"When you have this large [speculative] exposure built up, you do run a risk," said Tim Evans, a commodity
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective, a commodity-research arm of Citigroup. Because "you've used up your
potential to draw in more new money -- that's the time when you are vulnerable to a reversal."
That may have started.
Since Nov. 9, the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index has declined 7%, amid waves of selling triggered by
China's moves to tackle inflation.
Of all the commodities that were whipped around, those directly affected by demand from China suffered
most. Zinc sank 16%, cotton shed 15%, and crude oil fell 7%.
Investors "are getting more and more nervous as we get close to year end," said Andy Smith, senior
commodity strategist at Bache Commodities. They are "not sure whether they should take the money off the
table and run for the year or stay in the game."
Commodity consumers around the world are making real-time assessments about whether they should jump
in and buy now or wait for better prices.

--- Page 71 ---
Page 71 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Many are balancing not just fundamental supply-and-demand data but also macro forces such as monetary
policy in China and the U.S.
The debate over how fast China's economy may expand and whether other emerging markets will step down
hard on their economies also is driving some of the price swings.
The current volatility is a "fundamental manifestation of uncertainty about the pace of rising demand," said
Colin P. Fenton, head of global commodities research and strategy at J.P. Morgan Chase.
Consumer prices in China rose 4.4% in October from a year earlier, a 25-month high, setting off a slew of
anti-inflation moves, including an increase in bank reserve requirements and talk of possible price controls.
China has been the main source of demand growth for many commodities.
This year, the country's oil consumption is expected to increase 820,000 barrels a day, or 35% of the world's
total oil consumption growth, according to the International Energy Agency.
The country has an even bigger influence in other markets, accounting for 70%, 57% and 46% of this year's
global consumption rise for cotton, copper and soybeans, respectively.
"If you think China will grow less as a result of these policies, the next logical conclusion will be commodity
demand from that country will also moderate given its importance" in terms of generating demand growth,
said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas.
Some expect China's measures will only temporarily damp price increases for raw materials and won't hurt
the nation's real appetite for commodities. Even if China's economy expands at a slightly slower rate, it will be
a huge force in the commodities market.
"The steps that they're taking so far will have only a marginal impact," said Dwight Anderson, managing
partner at Ospraie Management LLC, a hedge fund specializing in commodities.
Soon, the markets will come to "conclude that the global economic recovery is intact and there will be
sustained growth, especially in the emerging markets, for commodity imports," Mr. Fenton said.
Other analysts even see a silver lining to China's cooling moves.
China is taking pre-emptive measures to tackle inflation. In 1994, when inflation ran up to 27.7%, the
country's central bank didn't increase interest rates but waited until a year later when the economy lost
steam.
"If we are concerned about rising prices, we are probably setting ourselves up for a stronger and healthier
way of growth," said Francisco Blanch, head of Global Commodity Research at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

The Intelligent Investor: Why Your Stock Portfolio Is Acting Like a Commodity Basket
The Intelligent Investor: Why Your Stock Portfolio Is Acting Like a Commodity Basket

Like Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier in the classic movie "The Defiant Ones," stocks and commodities seem
chained to each other against their will, desperate to break apart but unable to let go.
In the past few years, many investors have concluded that commodities like oil, corn and gold offer
independent returns that can diversify away the risks of stocks. But the correlations between stocks and
commodities -- the extent to which their prices move together -- are in many cases the highest they have
been in nearly 30 years.
This year, about 40% of the weekly movements in the S&P 500 index can be explained by weekly fluctuations
in energy prices, says Michele Gambera, head of quantitative analysis at UBS Global Asset Management.
That is twice the level of similarity over the past five years and roughly 20 times the level of the past two
decades.
Some of the linkages between stocks and commodities are looking bizarre. This Thursday, the monthly
correlation between sugar futures and the S&P 500 hit 67%, more than 10 times its level just six days earlier,
says Howard Simons, strategist at Bianco Research. That is the third time this year that the linkage between
sugar and stock prices surged above 60% -- much higher than their long-term average of under 20%.
How on earth did sugar and stock prices get stuck together? Sugar, says Mr. Simons, is now both an "energy
commodity" and a "growth story," since much of the Brazilian crop is used to produce ethanol. That gasoline
additive is linked to crude-oil prices, which in turn are sensitive to monetary policy and global economic
growth -- the same factors driving stock prices.
But there is another, less visible force at work, Mr. Simons says. Algorithmic trading programs, or "algos,"
automatically buy and sell a wide variety of assets based on mathematical models. An algo doesn't know or
care why two assets are moving together; it merely is programmed to recognize that they are doing so. As
soon as a computer places bets that such a linkage in prices will persist, other traders -- computers and
humans alike -- tend to take note and follow suit. That can be true, Mr. Simons says, whether or not a
correlation is driven by fundamental economic factors.
"We've gotten to the Frankenstein point where algos are self-programming, and they evolve to chase these
relationships," Mr. Simons says. "That's created a sheer wall of money that is forcing other people's behavior
into the same pattern."
Another group of commodities -- industrial metals -- seems to be exerting a magnetic force on some unusual
targets. According to global portfolio strategist Phil Mackintosh of Credit Suisse, in recent weeks, shoe
manufacturer Nike and fast-food giant Yum Brands both have been moving around 60% in lock step with the
prices of aluminum, copper and zinc. Those correlations have roughly doubled since May.
Of course, correlation isn't causation; this could be a coincidence. But "high commodity prices tend to indicate
healthy global growth," says David Bianco, chief U.S. equity strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. Stock
investors, too, are playing a robust rebound. Because many firms in the S&P 500 are big commodity
producers -- or supply others that are -- their earnings are tracking commodity prices even more closely than
in the past, Mr. Bianco says.
What's more, quantitative easing -- the massive purchase of bonds by the Federal Reserve -- and the global
recovery have been bullish for just about every asset. But at past economic turning points, the correlation
between stocks and commodities were lower than they are today.
For the foreseeable future, there will be plenty of periods in which diversification will seem to fail as tidal
waves of money crash in and out of all assets at once. As Mr. Simons puts it, "The longer your time frame as
an investor, the greater your risk tolerance has to be now, because over the short term diversification is going
to keep looking as if it's disappeared. It will re-emerge with time, though."

--- Page 74 ---

And you may have been riding the commodity boom without even realizing it. "It's a common assumption that
the average individual investor has zero allocation to commodities," says Matthew Carvalho, director of
investment research at Loring Ward, a financial-advisory firm in San Jose, Calif. "But most investors have
some indirect exposure to commodities through the stock market."
That exposure has risen sharply. "You get much more commodity exposure through equities today than you
did in the past," Mr. Simons says.
So don't worry if you haven't yet backed a truckload of commodities into your portfolio. "The diversification
offered by many alternative asset classes has been drastically reduced," Mr. Gambera says. "The benefit is a
lot less than you may think."

Corrections & Amplifications
A karat is a unit of measure for the fineness of
gold, while a carat is a unit of weight for precious stones. An earlier version
of this article incorrectly used carat when referring to gold.
(WSJ Jan. 30, 2016)
For jewelers, all that glitters this year isn't necessarily gold.
Big jewelry chains are scrambling to cope with the rising price of bullion while striving to keep their baubles
affordable for consumers still cautious in their spending.
Some are cutting back on the amount of gold in their products and turning to less expensive metals from
silver to tungsten. Jewelers also are buying precious metals in bulk at fixed prices to hedge the risk of further
spikes.
Even so, jewelry prices are likely to rise due to higher material costs. This year, gold prices have risen 22%,
settling Wednesday at $1,336.80 a troy ounce, near a record high in nominal terms. Silver is up 52% and
platinum is up 12%. A 14 carat gold chain that cost $250 10 years ago now sells for over $1,000, said Brian
Ree, co-founder of retailer GoldenMine.com Inc.
"If our costs go up, customers understand prices will go up as well," said Mark Aaron, vice president of
investor relations at Tiffany & Co.
The moves are aimed at helping the industry recover from anemic sales in the last few years. U.S. jewelry
sales fell 2.7% in 2008 and another 1.6% in 2009, according to market-research firm Mintel International
Group Ltd.
Gold's growing favor among investors worried about inflation and falling currencies has made the gold
market far less reliant on jewelry demand. Jewelry accounted for 52% of gold demand through the first three
quarters of this year, down from 73% in 2005, according to GFMS Ltd., which tracks the gold market.
In tonnage terms, the amount of gold used for jewelry plummeted by 35% between 2005 and 2009.
The fall-off has coincided with the decade-long gold rally, driven by investor interest. Since the end of 2000,
when the gold price settled at $272 a troy ounce, it has nearly quintupled.
Jewelers have scrambled to adjust. Ben Bridge Jeweler Inc., a division of Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Corp., is selling more silver and platinum items, and has added wedding bands made of cobalt and
tungsten at its 73 stores in 12 mostly Western states, according to Jon Bridge, a company executive. The
chain sells a men's size nine gold wedding band for $750; the same band in tungsten is $279.
"We've been looking at a lot of different alternatives," said Mr. Bridge. "Part of it is price driven, part of it is
fashion driven."
Signet Jewelers Ltd., which operates more than 900 Kay Jewelers stores in the U.S., is taking traditional gold
pieces and re-designing them to use greater amounts of silver in its place, said Ed Hrabak, senior vice
president of merchandising.
"I could add a pound of silver and still not equal the amount of gold," he said. Silver was $25.50 a troy ounce
on Wednesday, a fraction of the cost of gold.

--- Page 76 ---
Page 76 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Still, gold continues to hold its allure. Regardless of the spiraling gold prices, Katelyn Collier, a Dallas
publicist who married two months ago, bought her husband a wedding band made of white gold. "The jeweler
convinced me it was more durable and would hold its value better," Ms. Collier says.
David Lamb, managing director of jewelry at the World Gold Council, a mining trade group, said in an email
that some jewelers are "rotating product styles more frequently and investing in new inventory to keep
customers coming back to their stores."
At online retailer Blue Nile, an 18 carat white gold wedding band for a woman costs $580; a platinum version
costs $1,230.
With precious metals prices up broadly, some big merchants also are attempting to contain costs by buying
large amounts at a preset price, a strategy called hedging. "We don't do it to speculate, but just to smooth out
the price bumps," said Signet's Mr. Hrabak.
Tiffany has a hedging program for platinum and silver, but not for gold, which the company uses less of, said
Mr. Aaron. About 40% of Tiffany's products are diamonds set in platinum and 30% are silver jewelry.
Tiffany's customers are "less price-sensitive," said Adrianne Shapira, a Goldman Sachs analyst, though she
said in a recent research report that higher precious metals costs could "pressure" the firm's margins in 2011.
Mr. Aaron declined comment on the report, but he said metal costs are a component of price, as are labor
and gems. If gold goes up 20%, the price tag won't go up by the same amount.
Consumers who said they want jewelry as a holiday present rose 13% from a year ago, according to a study
conducted for the National Retail Federation by BIGresearch.
For department stores, that means being able to hold prices at key thresholds, such as $99, because
consumers are unwilling to pay more for what are seen as luxury items, said Ms. Shapira.
Limiting the impact on consumers may prove critical to the industry's health. The Mintel study found that
jewelry sales hit a recent high in 2007 at $50.2 billion, but forecast they would stay below $50 billion in 2010
dollars through 2015.

Dow Drops 178.47 in a Global Selloff --- Worries About Europe's Debt, Brakes on China's Growth Push Stock Indexes Downward World-Wide
Tuesday's Markets
Dow Drops 178.47 in a Global Selloff --- Worries About Europe's Debt, Brakes on China's Growth
Push Stock Indexes Downward World-Wide

Global stock markets' steady march higher was interrupted by concerns about growth in China, debt in
Europe and the Federal Reserve's $600 billion plan to stimulate the U.S. economy.
Tuesday's world-wide selling was touched off by a 4% stock drop in Shanghai. It spread to Europe, where
markets fell more than 2%, and then to the U.S., pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.6%, its
worst point and percentage decline since Aug. 11.
The declines continue during early Wednesday trading in Asia.
"All of this is raising the question about how sustainable this economic expansion is from here, both in the
U.S. and globally." said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee $25 billion as chief investment strategist at
Cleveland's Key Private Bank, an arm of KeyCorp. "The fact that we have run stocks up since June just
leaves the market open to the normal anxieties about whether we have come too far too fast."
The selloff began in China, where investors worried that strong inflation numbers would lead to higher
interest rates, which would slow the country's strong growth.
That news led investors to dump commodities futures such as oil, down 3%, and copper, down 5.1%.
In Europe, efforts to bail out Ireland and prevent its financial problems from spreading to other weak
economies sent shares down, with the U.K.'s FTSE 100 falling 2.4%, its worst loss since August. The last
U.S. stock-market rally was undone by the spring's flare-up of the European debt crisis, and the current
anxiety over Ireland added momentum to the selloff.
"The biggest concern that we can see is the news out of Europe, which most of the markets seem to have
forgotten since June, when we last worried about that," Mr. McCain said.
In the U.S., the market's sudden bout of jitters has reawakened concerns that the hobbled U.S. housing
market and anemic American consumer spending could combine to put an end to the robust gains in the
market since summer.
The Dow fell 178.47 points to 11023.50. Although the Dow is down 3.7% in seven trading days, it still has
risen 14% since July 2.
Bullish investors are hoping that this is just a speed bump on the road to a stronger world economy and more
market gains. They noted that China continues to turn in robust growth, that Europe already is developing
rescue plans for its weaker economies, and that the Fed seems unlikely to abandon its support for the
economy.
Chinese stocks had been up 33% over the previous four months, but have fallen 8% in the past three days,
amid growing fears of more government measures to control inflation by slowing growth.
South Korea's benchmark index fell 0.8% after the central bank raised its key interest rate by 0.25%, citing
rising inflation. Hong Kong fell 1.4% and Bombay 2.2%. Britain was down 2.4%, France 2.6% and Brazil
1.7%.
Stock investors also have been spooked by sudden instability in the Treasury-bond market. Treasurys, whose
prices had tumbled on Monday, rebounded in price on Tuesday as investors sought safe refuges.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, its yield falling to 2.849%.

--- Page 79 ---
Page 79 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
That restored some but not all of the note's Monday decline of 1 11/32 points. The Treasury-market's sudden
ferment stems from uncertainty about how much money the Fed will spend to buy Treasury bonds as it tries
to stimulate the economy.
The dollar also benefited from investors' flight to quality, sending the euro down 0.6% against the dollar to
$1.3489. Gold, which has moved with stocks rather than acting as a safe haven, declined 2.2%.
The catalyst for the bad day was the Shanghai market's accelerating plunge, which follows last week's news
of a faster-than-expected 4.4% October increase in Chinese prices, compared to a year earlier.
China's predicament reflects the divide separating emerging markets, with their fast-growing economies and
inflation fears, from the developed world, where deflation and economic stagnation are the main concerns.
Last week's China inflation numbers were "the 'a-ha' moment everyone was looking for," said Christian
Thwaites, chief executive of Sentinel Investments in Montpellier, Vt.
"Investors are saying, 'China is overblown -- there's inflation coming, and they're going to have to tighten up
their economy,"' said Mr. Thwaites. He said China is strong enough to grow through any anti-inflation steps.
"China may have surprised people, but I think the market has overreacted," Mr. Thwaites said.
All the same, the Shanghai composite now is down 11.7% since the start of the year. China's central bank
has raised interest rates once since the end of the financial crisis, tightened lending requirements with banks
several times, and put restrictions on foreign investors bringing money into the country.
"For China, we look to them for their importance as a global growth engine. If they tighten too much, they
could slow their own growth and the world's growth," said Linda Duessel, stock-market strategist at Federated
Investors, who credits Chinese growth with pushing a number of emerging markets to recent multi-year highs.
But Ms. Duessel said she doesn't foresee any major stumbles on stocks or on the Chinese economy.
"China's leaders are focused and have been focused on stable growth -- whatever they've been doing has
been quite prudent," she said. "And the Shanghai market has been on a nice run, so to pull back is quite

Ron Paul's Golden Opportunity

One of the most exciting features of the new Congress is the prospect that the chairmanship of a House
subcommittee that oversees the Federal Reserve will go to Ron Paul. Final assignments are still being
worked out, and the leadership may yet shy away from giving the position to a congressman who doesn't
believe the Fed should exist. But Dr. Paul, an obstetrician, has been the ranking Republican of the Domestic
Monetary Policy and Technology subcommittee, and tradition suggests he will be the next chairman.
This couldn't come at a more timely moment, though Dr. Paul has been working his way up to the assignment
for more than a generation.
I first met the congressman nearly 30 years ago, back when the physician-turned-legislator was emerging on
the national scene as a member of the United States Gold Commission. The commission had been formed at
the start of the Reagan administration to consider whether America, in the wake of the collapse of Bretton
Woods, should move to sound money.
In the event, the committee recoiled from reform. But Dr. Paul wrote a dissent that made the case for gold
and is still being read today.
At the time, the value of the dollar had recently plunged to less than 1/800th of an ounce of gold. The
collapse was reversed by the pro-growth policies of President Reagan and by a Fed chairman, in Paul
Volcker, of uncommon vision and courage. Momentum for a gold standard was hard to sustain when
inflation was being brought down, if not conquered, by other means.
Right now we are experiencing an even more dramatic collapse of the greenback -- this time to little more
than 1/1,400th of an ounce of gold -- and the issue has returned with a vengeance. The Fed is reacting to the
dollar's collapse with a campaign of quantitative easing. The plan is to cascade hundreds of billions of
additional dollars into the economy on the theory that we need inflation. No doubt this kind of thing will, if Dr.
Paul accedes to the chairmanship, come in for a good deal more focused oversight than the committee has
provided under Democratic leadership.
Heretofore, the subcommittee has "basically been a committee that's dealt with commemorative coins," as Dr.
Paul has put it. In a conversation with me on Monday, the congressman said that he intends to get into the
question of monetary policy itself. He would start by bringing in to testify to the committee not only the Fed
chairman, but some of the leading officers and economists of some of the regional banks in the Federal
Reserve system.
More far-reaching still is the prospect that Dr. Paul might use the committee to open up the deepest monetary
issues, pressing for audits of America's gold holdings and of the Fed itself. At one point this week, the
congressman's book, "End the Fed," ranked No. 2 on Amazon's list of the best-selling business books
dealing with money and monetary policy, ahead of volumes by such luminaries of the right and left as Milton
Friedman, George Soros and John Maynard Keynes himself.
Most exciting is the prospect that Dr. Paul will be able to bring into the national conversation such figures as,
say, Edwin Vieira Jr., the visionary lawyer who has become the sage of the idea of constitutional money.
That's a reference to the unit of account to which the Founders were referring when they twice used the word
"dollars" in the Constitution, and which they codified in the Coinage Act of 1792 as 371 1/4 grains of pure
silver, the same as in a then-ubiquitous coin known as the Spanish Milled Dollar, or its free-market equivalent
in gold.
If Dr. Paul does accede to the chairmanship of the monetary subcommittee, he will, in but a few months,
gavel it to order on the 40th anniversary of the summer in which President Nixon closed the gold window and
brought an end to Bretton Woods. Yet a few weeks ago, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan himself,
speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, warned that "fiat money has no place to go but gold." Even the

president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, has just called for restoring a role for gold in the monetary
system.
The great debate is finally starting up again. Who better to host it in Congress than the diminutive doctor who,
more faithfully than anyone else on the Hill, has for more than a generation stood for the idea of sound
money?

Vietnam Plans Export Tax To Curb Gold Speculation
Vietnam Plans Export Tax To Curb Gold Speculation

HANOI -- Vietnam is considering a new 20% export tax on gold, in a move analysts said could help curb
speculation in the commodity and reduce volatility in the dong.
The Ministry of Finance said the tariff, which will also apply to semi-manufactured forms of gold and gold
plated with platinum, is aimed at curbing exports of the metal.
The current export tariff on gold ranges from 0% to 30%, the ministry said in a statement. However, an
official with the Ministry of Finance's Tax Department said it has until now been imposing zero tax on such
exports.
The proposal by the ministry is being considered by the State Bank of Vietnam, the Ministry of Industry and
Trade and other agencies.
Vietnamese have been buying up gold and the greenback due to the country's high inflation and a lack of
faith in the local currency.
Local prices for gold and the U.S dollar have climbed to historic highs -- even exceeding international gold
prices which are also at a record high -- and this has unsettled money markets, Hanoi-based analysts say.
"For the short-term, limiting gold exports will help avoid unnecessary price fluctuations in the domestic gold
market that may lead to chaos," said Vo Tri Thanh, an economist with the Ministry of Planning and
Investment. "As people's confidence in the macro economy is low, they choose to buy gold while the supply
is low, leading to gold speculation."
He said large amounts of gold retained among locals can later be mobilized for economic development.
The government has been moving to contain volatility in the currency market as pressure increases on the
need for a further devaluation, although authorities have ruled out such a move for this year.
The greenback, which was set at 18,932 dong Friday, has risen 8.2% against the local currency so far this
year. In the past week, it gained 1.9%.
The announcement Friday comes after the central bank said earlier in the week that it would allow
commercial banks to import gold, after the domestic price of gold reached a record high. Although it didn't
provide details on the amount of gold to be imported, it said the import license will be valid for two weeks.
State Bank of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Van Giau also said that many Vietnamese have rushed to buy gold
because of "expectations that the domestic price will keep rising."
Earlier this month, the central bank issued regulations banning banks from using their gold deposits to make
loans or from converting them into dong or foreign currency for loans in an effort to curb speculative gold and
forex trading activities.
The new rule, which came into immediate effect, also prevents banks from lending gold deposits in retail
forms, such as gold bars.
By the end of September, local banks received 92.4 tons of gold deposits, valued at 73 trillion dong ($3.74
billion), and they lent out 60% of that volume.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Wealth Manager: Structured Notes: Not as Safe as They Seem

Brokerages are rushing out more instruments that promise some equity returns with less risk. In theory, the
products work well. But investors should ask some questions before diving in.
So far this year, sales of retail "structured products" -- complicated derivatives packaged for individual
investors -- have hit a record $45 billion, compared with $34 billion last year, according to
StructuredRetailProducts.com.
Michael Kalscheur, an adviser in Indianapolis, is urging clients to consider structured notes, a type of
structured product, as a way to wade back into stocks -- and reduce the amount of money in bond funds --
without taking on too much risk.
"One use is to give people who aren't in the markets an opportunity to get in with a nice defensive option,"
says Mr. Kalscheur, who recently started using structured notes from Deutsche Bank AG. "For people who
are already in, now they can take some of that money off the table and be more defensive."
Structured notes have been around for years. In the past they have promised full downside protection in
exchange for limited upside participation. But with interest rates low and volatility high by historical
standards, fewer firms can afford to construct 100% "principle protected" products cheaply enough to lure
buyers.
Instead, most of today's versions offer only "buffered" protection, which provides a fixed amount of downside
protection, or "contingent protection," which covers losses only until the underlying asset drops below a
certain level. Once that happens, the protection is canceled and investors bear the brunt of the losses.
Consider one of UBS AG's Return Optimization Securities with Contingent Protection, which was priced in
July. Investors get 100% principal protection as long as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hasn't fallen
more than 30% at the end of the product's three-year term. If the index falls more than 30%, investors suffer
all the losses. If the markets fall by less than 30%, investors get back their principal at the end of product's
term. If the index rises, investors earn 1.5 times the upside, up to a cap of 58.6%, which they get if the index
is up 39%. Fees, also called the "underwriting discount," are 2.5%.
The limited protection might not work out for all investors. Since 1926, a note that protected against a drop of
30% in the S&P 500 would have pierced the downside cap 7% of the time, leaving the investor exposed to
the entire loss, while protecting them from a loss 17% of the time on a rolling 36-month basis, according to
Morningstar Inc.'s Ibbotson Associates.
Similar structured products also are being packaged inside variable annuities. On Oct. 4, AXA Equitable
made available its first batch of Structured Capital Strategies, structured products inside a variable annuity.
The instrument allows investors to pick a benchmark (the S&P 500, Russell 2000, MSCI EAFE, gold or oil), a
time frame (one, three or five years) and some amount of downside protection (10%, 20% or 30%). Their
upside is determined by their choices.
According to Ibbotson data, however, a note that lasted one year and protected investors from a 10% drop in
the S&P 500 while giving exposure to 12% of the upside would have reached the upside cap more than 40%
of the time since 1926, while benefiting from the downside protection just 14% of the time. It would have
broken the downside protection limit 19% of the time, resulting in losses.
"You can't entirely eliminate market risk without also eliminating reward," says Jamie Shepherdson, president
of retirement savings at AXA Equitable.
Craig McCann of Securities Litigation & Consulting Group Inc., or SLCG, a Fairfax, Va., consulting firm that
provides expert witnesses to regulators, law firms, banks and brokerages, is skeptical of structured products.

--- Page 84 ---

The vast majority, he says, are worth substantially less than the notes' face value. Structured notes also can
be difficult to sell during a market rout, and investors have to worry about counterparty risk.
In October, SLCG launched an online database of structured products from firms including Barclays PLC,
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, UBS and Deutsche Bank. The site (www.slcg.com/products.php)
offers analysis and valuations of the products.
Some advisers have been taking more of a hands-on approach to downside protection. In August 2009, MDE
Group, a wealth-management firm in Morristown, N.J., launched its own product, dubbed the Planned Return
Strategy, which uses options to protect the first 12% of losses on an underlying index -- an S&P 500
exchange-traded fund -- and delivers up to double the index's returns up to a cap in the low double digits.
Unlike other structured products where investors make a one-time investment, MDE makes an investment
every two weeks, allowing investors to dollar-cost-average into the strategy and potentially reduce the
likelihood that they will buy at an inopportune time. Annual expenses are 1.2%, plus trading costs of about
0.30%.
Herb Sosman, a 78-year-old retired executive in Jupiter, Fla., invested nearly all of his wealth in MDE's
strategy because limiting the downside trumped having 100% of the market's gains. "If I have to lose money,"
he says, "it won't be a disaster."

Nov. 8-12
U.S./Politics
-- The leaders of a White House commission laid out a sweeping proposal to cut the federal budget deficit by
hundreds of billions of dollars a year by targeting sacrosanct areas of U.S. tax and spending policy, such as
Social Security benefits, middle-class tax breaks and defense spending. The plan would also significantly
lower the corporate tax rate, from a current top rate of 35% to as low as 26%, and eliminate a number of
deductions. Overall, it would hold down the growth of the federal debt by roughly $3.8 trillion by 2020, or
about half of the $7.7 trillion by which the debt would have otherwise grown by that year, according to the
commission's staff. The interim report by the panel's co-chairmen stands as an opening bid in what will likely
be a heated debate over the future of spending and taxes, central issues in the midterm elections.
-- BP added risk to its ill-fated Gulf of Mexico well by removing a safeguard before fully sealing the well, the
lead investigator for a presidential panel said, a finding that puts the spotlight on the oil giant's decisions in
the fateful final hours before the blast. At the same time, investigators suggested the disaster reflected
systemic problems in the industry.
-- Home prices fell in nearly half of U.S. metropolitan areas in the third quarter, indicating the market is losing
steam without government tax credits, according to an industry report. Meanwhile, the push by mortgage
companies to accelerate the snarled foreclosure process is running into resistance from judges cracking
down on sloppy paperwork.
-- A small but growing number of Democratic lawmakers called on House Speaker Pelosi to abandon her plan
to run for the post of minority leader in the new Congress. The biggest bloc in opposition includes surviving
members of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition.
-- The Obama administration is preparing a stepped-up approach to policing Internet privacy that calls for new
laws and the creation of a new position to oversee the effort, according to people familiar with the matter.
-- New York City schools Chancellor Joel Klein said he was resigning, ending his eight-year tenure at the
helm of the nation's largest school system. In his place, Mayor Bloomberg named Cathie Black, chairwoman
of Hearst Magazines, who will be the first woman to head the $23 billion system of 1.1 million students. Klein
is joining News Corp., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.
-- A federal prosecutor decided against bringing charges in the 2005 destruction of Central Intelligence
Agency videotapes showing harsh interrogations of terrorism detainees.
-- The drive in Congress to repeal the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy appears all but lost for the
foreseeable future.

World
-- The euro-zone fiscal crisis erupted anew as it appeared Ireland was close to joining Greece in line for
bailouts. Relief came Friday at the Group of 20 summit in Seoul, where EU finance ministers pledged that
holders of government debt wouldn't suffer losses should a European nation default. The summit also yielded
an agreement on economic rebalancing, and nations backed broad rules to limit risk at big banks -- without
ironing out implementation. Obama emerged from the global summit chastened by leaders who complained
about the side effects of U.S. economic policy and saw his stature on the world stage diminished by a weak
economic recovery and election losses at home.

-- Obama failed to meet his own deadline for a free-trade pact with South Korea, dealing a potentially lethal
blow to a deal key to his effort to promote export growth. Cars and beef were hurdles. While in Asia, he
returned to Indonesia, where he emphasized Islamic tolerance.
-- Iraqi politicians broke an eight-month stalemate in forming a government, though the deal's survival
remained uncertain. The power-sharing pact gives new terms to Shiite Prime Minister Maliki and Kurdish
President Talabani and puts Allawi, whose bloc represents Sunnis, in a new federal post. Allawi's bloc
stormed out of a meeting of parliament that was held to implement the deal. A wave of attacks on Christian
communities continued.
-- Myanmar's military regime staged the country's first election in 20 years, an exercise Obama deemed
"neither fair nor free," as he called for the release of dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, whose house-arrest order
expires Saturday. Partial results suggested the junta won.
-- Corruption charges hobbled vote-counting in Afghanistan. A quarter of ballots have been disqualified.
-- Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, in an Internet video, called on followers to kill Americans. British
police said an explosive device attributed to his al Qaeda affiliate, one of two disguised as printer cartridges
and shipped on cargo flights, was timed to go off over the Eastern seaboard. The U.S. banned certain toner
and ink cartridges on domestic flights and planes bound for the U.S., to boost airline security. Government
lawyers argued for the dismissal of a district court suit to stop Washington from ordering Awlaki's
assassination.

Business
-- A downbeat revenue forecast from Cisco sent shivers through the stock market, raising questions about the
Silicon Valley giant's execution and whether a recent recovery in corporate technology spending is beginning
to stall. But analysts pointed out that many of the problems seem specific to the company.
-- GM earned $2 billion in the third quarter, marking a third straight quarterly profit as the auto maker churned
out more high-margin pickup trucks and consumers paid higher prices for its vehicles. The results come as
GM pitches itself to investors ahead of its planned IPO.
-- Rolls-Royce said it would replace a component in Trent 900 engines following its investigation into the
cause of an engine failure last week on an Airbus A380, and warned that its earnings growth would slow as a
result of the problem. Separately, Boeing suspended test flights of its 787 Dreamliner as it investigated an
in-flight fire on one of the jets that caused a major onboard power failure and forced the plane to make an
emergency landing in Texas.
-- The FCC is investigating whether Google broke federal laws when its street-mapping service collected
consumers' personal information. Meanwhile, Google is fighting off Facebook and other fast-growing Internet
firms poaching its staff.
-- Comcast is expected to unveil a major reorganization of NBC Universal as early as next week.
-- Retailers and manufacturers are slashing flat-screen TV prices more aggressively than usual this holiday
season to avoid a pileup of inventory.

Markets
-- The Fed began its bond-buying program, picking up $7.2 billion in U.S. debt maturing in four to six years,
but Treasury prices fell, pushing the yield on the 10-year note to its highest level since mid-September. The
rise in yields presents a challenge for the Fed as it attempts to lower borrowing costs for consumers and
businesses. The Dow industrials declined 2.2% for the week, capped by a 90.52-point slide on Friday amid
renewed worry that China could try to cool its economy's expansion to ward off inflation.
-- Speculative money surged into commodities as supply constraints, demand from emerging markets and the
Fed's plans to pour cash into the economy created a heady cocktail. Gold hit a record level, cotton rallied to
its highest level in more than 140 years and copper neared an all-time high, though prices eased later in the
week. Commodities exchanges responded by raising the deposits for trading futures contracts.
-- Fear over whether European countries can handle their debts worsened as investors worried about efforts
to make bond investors help pay for euro-zone bailouts. The yield premium that investors demand to hold
Irish government bonds, rather than safer German debt, hit a record high. The cost to insure against default
of Irish, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds rose to record levels as well.

-- The largest U.S. banks, already worrying over tougher international capital requirements, face another
burden: a bigger bill for deposit insurance. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s board voted to start
implementing a provision of the U.S. financial-sector overhaul that will shift more of the cost to the biggest
banks from smaller ones.

Robert Fairlie at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Many of those, though, are non-employer firms, such as one-person consultancies or eBay businesses,
which people set up because they can't find jobs. New small firms created 11% fewer jobs in 2009 than in
2007, according to the Labor Department.

Investors Walk Out As the Fed Buys In

On the day that the Federal Reserve started buying, everyone else was selling.
Investors sold off everything from stocks to Treasury bonds and gold on Friday, just as the Fed began its
"quantitative easing" program, its economic stimulus effort dubbed QE2.
"There were a lot of hopes and bets on QE2, and now that it's actually out, those bets are all leaking away,"
said Guy LeBas, fixed-income strategist at Janney Capital Markets.
The post-QE2 moves are the mirror image of the market for months preceding the announcement, when
almost all asset classes rose. Now investors are dumping trades that had generated months of healthy gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 90.52 points on Friday to 11192.58, down more than 2.2% for the
week though still up 7.3% for the year-to-date. Just a week ago, the blue-chip stock index was at its highest
level since before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.
The Dow has now given up all of its gains after the Fed's announcement on Nov. 3 of its plan to pump $600
billion in fresh cash into financial markets.
Gold and silver, too, ended the week at their lowest prices since Nov. 3. Gold fell $31.90 an ounce or nearly
3% to $1,365.40.
Crude-oil prices fell $2.93 a barrel, or 3%, to $84.88 in Nymex trading, also the lowest since Nov. 3.
Agricultural commodities such as cotton, sugar and soybeans also fell. In the corporate-bond market, losers
outnumbered winners more than 3 to 1 in the most actively traded bonds on Friday, according to
MarketAxess.
The immediate culprit for the selloff was news that China plans to curb its runaway economic growth to keep
inflation in check. Worries about sovereign debt in the euro zone also lingered, though European debt
markets rebounded on Friday after finance ministers reassured them that countries needing bailouts wouldn't
first have to restructure their debt.
But these worries aren't new and probably tell only part of the story.
Treasury debt also took a beating, suggesting the overarching theme for the week was dumping trades that
flourished in the months leading up to the Fed's announcement.
In the past, worries about European debt and Chinese growth have benefited safe-haven Treasurys. The
spring's euro-debt crisis triggered a Treasury rally of more than five months. In that time, Treasurys offered
investors a 9% return, according to Barclays Capital indexes.
The past week was different: Investors sold Treasurys along with everything else.
The yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, surged to 2.754%, its highest
level since mid-September. The dollar, which took a drubbing as stocks, bonds and commodities rallied, was
one of the few bright spots. The greenback rose 2% -- nearly matching gold's drop.

Too Bullish?
The percentage of investors who think the market will rise during the next six months rose to 57.6% during
the week ended Nov. 10, according to an American Association of Individual Investors survey. That's the
highest percentage of bulls since 2007 -- a sign that investors may be overconfident.
CD Rates Plunge
The average interest rate on certificates of deposit with maturities from three months to five years fell to
0.99% in October, according to Market Rates Insight, the first time it had dropped below 1% in at least 20
years. Rates have fallen 3.54 points from their peak in September 2006.
Commodities Slump
After rallying early in the week, commodities sold off Friday on fears that China would hike interest rates.
Gold dropped 2.2% after closing above $1,400 for the first time on Monday, while wheat fell 8.9%. Sugar
plunged 9.6% on Friday alone, its biggest single-day decline in 30 years.

Stocks declined at the end of a lackluster week as investors, already on edge about global growth, became
concerned that China could take steps to brake its economy's expansion.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 90.52 points, or 0.80%, to 11192.58, its lowest level since Nov. 2, the
day of the U.S. congressional elections. The Dow fell 2.2% for the week.
Stocks have surrendered all of their gains since Republicans seized control of the House of Representatives
and the Federal Reserve announced its much-anticipated bond-buying program.
The Nasdaq Composite fell 37.31, or 1.46% to 2518.21. The Nasdaq shed 2.4% for the week, ending a string
of five consecutive weekly gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.33, or 1.18% to 1199.21 on
Friday, also breaking a five-week winning streak.
Asian markets fell on Friday as concerns resurfaced that the Chinese government would further tighten
monetary policy to counter inflation.
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 5.2%, erasing nearly a quarter of its three-month upswing. It
was the measure's biggest drop in 14 months.
Materials stocks led the S&P 500's drop, as investors worried that demand could suffer if China, a big user of
natural resources, raises interest rates.
Fertilizer producer CF Industries fell $8.10, or 6.4%, to 119.65, while copper producer Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold sank 4.09, or 3.8%, to 103.92, and mining and natural-resources company Cliffs Natural
Resources fell 2.53, or 3.6%, to 67.52. Aluminum maker Alcoa slid 32 cents, or 2.3%, to 13.49.
Not all investors fretted over potential tightening in China. "They're taking prudent measures to keep their
inflation in check," said Brian Peardon, wealth advisor at Harrison Financial Group. "It's not going to kill their
growth, it's just going to keep it in control."
Boeing was the Dow's worst performer on Friday, shedding 2.28, or 3.5%, to 63.09, after Bernstein Research
cut its investment rating on the company to "market perform" from "outperform," citing "greater margin risk" on
the 787 aircraft.
But Walt Disney was a bright spot for the Dow, rising 1.82, or 5.1%, to 37.75, despite reporting adjusted
earnings per share, excluding one-time items, a penny shy of the average analyst estimate. But analysts
found underlying positive trends in the results, including rising bookings at Disney's theme parks.
Intel rose 32 cents, or 1.5%, to 21.53, after its board approved a 15% dividend increase starting in the first
quarter as the semiconductor maker said it continues to generate strong cash flows.
Wendy's/Arby's Group shares fell 7 cents, or 1.4%, to 4.97, after the fast-food seller announced a
third-quarter drop in sales and margins and North America same-store sales fell 5.9%. The company also
announced plans to boost its stock buyback program by $170 million to $250 million and increase its quarterly
dividend by one-third to two cents a share.
Nvidia jumped 65 cents, or 5.2%, to 13.26, after beating third-quarter profit estimates.

NEW YORK -- Commodities tumbled on worries that China will take fresh action to slow its surging economy,
threatening the biggest source of demand growth for oil, soybeans and other goods.
Traders expect China's central bank to raise interest rates after digesting a report published Thursday that
inflation there rose to 4.4% in October.
Grains and metals markets had hit fresh multiyear highs as rising inflation pointed to red-hot economic
growth. But those markets and others swooned on Friday on Chinese media reports of looming
anti-inflationary efforts, which would likely come at the expense of economic growth.
The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, which tracks a variety of commodities, posted the biggest single-day
percentage decline since February 2009. December crude oil shed 3.3% to $84.88 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, off a two-year high, while soybean and corn prices plunged more than 5%. Sugar
tumbled nearly 12%, a day after both set a 30-year high and then slumped 9.6%.
November gold fell $37.70, or 2.7%, to $1365.40 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. That left
it down 2.3% for the week.
Other precious metals traded in New York, which have smaller markets and tend to be more volatile than
gold, also dropped sharply. Comex November silver fell $1.4630, or 5.3%, to $25.9380 an ounce, leaving it
down 1.4% for the week and snapping a two-week win streak. Comex December silver fell 5.3%. Nymex
January platinum shed 3.5%, and December palladium fell 4.3%.
The declines even spilled over into wheat and live cattle futures.
Commodities investors have focused intently on policy decisions made world-wide to manage inflation. The
Federal Reserve's $600 billion economic stimulus announced early this month sent investors into
commodities markets last week in the search for hard assets as a hedge against the prospects of inflation
and a weakening dollar.
But any rate increase in China likely would be designed to limit prices from rising and could reduce the
amount of money available for investors to pump into commodity markets.
"It counteracts the impact of quantitative easing in the U.S.," said Jim Steel, senior vice president and metals
analyst with HSBC Holding in New York.
The dollar weakened against rivals on Friday, but that did little to support commodity prices, with traders so
focused on Chinese demand. Cotton futures, which set a record this past week because China's mills were
seen buying up global supplies to replace a rain-damaged domestic crop, shed 2.8% on Friday. The steep
decline in grains was closely tied to China's role as the leading importer of U.S. soybeans. Analysts also
expect the country to re-emerge as a big buyer of U.S. corn this year.
"Some of these markets have gotten ahead of themselves," said Zachary Oxman, a managing director at
TrendMax Futures.
Others called Friday's declines a temporary retreat in such markets as soybeans and cotton experiencing real
supply shortages. Corn's 5.3% decline came after a rally that had carried futures prices up 70% since June.

Calstrs Reins In Plans for A Big Bet

Calstrs Reins In Plans for A Big Bet

One of the nation's largest pension funds has dialed back its plans to plow $2.5 billion into the commodities
market after missing a historic rally.
After nine months of deliberating, the California State Teachers' Retirement System decided against plowing
headlong into the market. Instead it will tiptoe in with a $150 million investment.
Driven by demand from China and easy monetary policy in the U.S., commodity markets have soared to
new highs. On Thursday, copper hit a record in London and gold is near nominal highs. The markets also
have grown increasingly volatile. Sugar fell 11% on Thursday, its biggest one-day decline in 30 years, and
silver dropped more than 7% on Wednesday.
A Calstrs spokesman said the fund's investment committee wanted to pursue a more "conservative"
investment that the fund can monitor for up to three years rather than making a large commodities allocation
in its portfolio.
Calstrs is striking a cautious tone as other investors pile into commodities through exchange-traded funds
and direct investment in the futures markets. The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index has risen almost 20%
since February, when Calstrs first began considering its investment.
More than $10.4 billion flowed into ETFs in the first nine months of this year, helping push total managed
assets to $320 billion, says Barclays Capital, up from $90 billion in 2005.
Calstrs's tentative approach underscores the caution some pension funds are taking toward commodities
after being clobbered in 2008 when another big commodities rally lost steam. As of September, the California
Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, lost 13% on commodities since it began investing in the
sector in 2007.
Pension funds' typically slow decision-making process could put them at a disadvantage against other
fast-moving traders. Pensions have also run into resistance from commodity regulators. They were fingered
by some legislators and consumers as a driver of the spike of oil prices in 2008, although there's still little
evidence to show the relationship.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering imposing limits on the maximum positions that
financial investors can hold, which potentially will limit the capacity and increase the cost for pensions to
invest in commodities.
Another hurdle: Commodities have become a lightening rod for criticism from humanitarian groups who say
that large pension-fund investments contribute to price swings that can hurt poorer nations by exacerbating
food shortages.
Nonprofit groups, including Maryknoll, a Catholic organization, lobbied Calstrs to reconsider its commodities
allocation.
Calstrs spokesman Ricardo Duran said "social issues are a factor in all our investments," but he said dialing
back the commodities allocation was "mostly an investment driven decision."
The debate over commodities comes as pensions funds are looking for ways to juice returns and make up
shortfalls in funding of their future benefit obligations to retirees.
"Calstrs' primary interest in commodities is its role as an inflation hedge," said Chief Investment Officer
Christopher Ailman in a Sept. 22 letter to Maryknoll.

--- Page 94 ---
Page 94 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Mr. Ailman added that commodities tend to benefit from "high, unexpected inflation which can be detrimental
to equity and fixed income returns."
That's particularly relevant now as the Federal Reserve prepares to pump $600 billion into the U.S. economy.
Calstrs considered a $2.5 billion commodity investment starting in the spring, but decided to cut it back this
fall. The proposed $150 million investment represents a fraction of the fund's $139 billion of assets.
Other funds like the Teacher Retirement System of Texas are more aggressive. The fund can invest up to 7%
of its assets in commodities and it has invested $330 million in a gold portfolio.
Overall, institutional investors account for a small portion of the commodities market.
Calpers currently invests about $2.1 billion in commodities, which falls just short of its target of 1.5% of its
$220 billion portfolio. The pension fund has the ability to increase its allocation to 3%, a spokesman said.
"It's a long-term strategy," spokesman Clark McKinley said. "We are not going to be making any huge
changes. We are just staying the course. If we see opportunities we will beef it up."
Calpers started investing mostly in a commodities index, but it has gotten more active in selecting its
investments in recent years. That worries Calpers' investment consultant Wilshire Associates, which recently
said the fund would likely need additional resources to keep up with its active bets on commodities.
Calpers has no permanent commodities portfolio manager since John Kowalik left in September to take a job
at UBS AG.
"If there was an effort to ramp up investment one could reasonably expect that we might bring on more staff,"
said Mr. McKinley, adding that the search for a new commodities portfolio manager is a top priority. Calpers
commodity investments have gained 6% in the past year.
Despite the squeamishness, Wall Street has been championing commodities. J.P. Morgan Asset
Management has been circulating research to pension funds extolling commodities.
"The risk/return case for including commodities as one component of a diversified portfolio has become
stronger in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and amid the economic ascendancy of China," according to
the J.P. Morgan paper. It did point out that commodities are volatile.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Jeremy Grantham's "hex" on gold isn't working out, and that has been good for his personal portfolio. The
chief investment strategist at investment firm GMO is a nonbeliever in what he calls the "faith-based metal."
He says it doesn't pay dividends, can't be eaten and generally serves no useful purpose. Still, a few months
ago he bought some for himself, just to speculate. After all, he is a longtime critic of loose Federal Reserve
monetary policy. He tells The Wall Street Journal that he figured the price would promptly fall after he
bought in.
Now that it is up 30% this year, Mr. Grantham says his staff is pestering him to sell. Yet Mr. Grantham is
holding on. Perhaps he likes a little insurance against the possibility that the Fed's "ill-chosen program of
ultracheap rates at all costs may end by creating a currency war."

The record in favor of a gold standard is not quite as clear as Charles W. Kadlec suggests ("Gold vs. the
Fed: The Record Is Clear," op-ed, Oct. 28). Top Fed officials sometimes appear to be the only ones who
remain unconvinced that discretionary monetary policy had anything to do with the recent global financial
crisis.
But Mr. Kadlec fails to mention the Great Depression, when economic carnage was greater than during the
recent financial crisis, even as we were on the gold standard. In fact, many economists argue that the
Depression continued precisely because we clung to the gold standard.
Which monetary regime to use is a choice among imperfect alternatives. A gold standard has proved no
better than a central bank at preserving economic stability and keeping variability in the price level low. The
notion that discretionary monetary policy leads to superior outcomes no longer passes the smell test after
the recent financial crisis. It would appear that returning to a rule-based way of setting monetary policy is the
least imperfect among the available alternatives.
Jerry H. Tempelman, CFA

I'm not eager to defend the Fed's inflationary tendencies, but those who want to put us back on the gold
standard have some explaining to do. When our economy doubles in size, as it most surely will, do they plan
to have us double our gold holdings? If other growing nations have also turned to the gold standard, will we
all be bidding for shrinking stocks of the ever-less-useful yellow metal?
What we really need is a new charter for the Fed that focuses all its energies on monetary stability, and a
new charter for Congress which insists that it do its job of managing the nation's budget. We're not going to
achieve lasting fiscal and monetary discipline any other way.
John Lumbard, CFA
Hollis, N.H.
---
Mr. Kadlec notes that the U.S. dollar has been devalued by more than 70% against the values of the euro
and the yen over the past 42 years, and versus the value of gold, the dollar is off about 97%.
The issue is whether abandonment of the gold standard was a symptom or a cause of weaker economic
results. The causative factor that stands out is expansion of the federal government. Federal outlays grew
close to 8% per year from 1947 to 1967, and federal spending as a percent of GDP grew from 14.8% to
19.4%. By the end of the 1960s, inflation and currency devaluation were the only options that allowed
continued spending on both guns and butter. After abandoning the gold standard, federal outlays kept
growing by more than 7% per year for the next four decades and now represent 25.4% of GDP, with a related
deficit of $1.3 trillion.
The root cause of America's longer-term economic problems is the unwinding of constitutional constraints that
kept Washington's power-seekers and social engineers in check. If that problem is left unresolved, any type
of currency value and monetary discipline will be reliable only until the next election cycle.

Commodity Prices Surge --- Gold, Cotton Touch New Highs as Fed Stimulus, Chinese Growth Drive Demand

Strong demand for raw materials from emerging markets and a flood of money promised by the U.S. Federal
Reserve are pushing commodities prices to new highs.
The broad rally has gained steam since the Fed indicated in late August it would inject money into the U.S.
economy. But the gains also reflect a powerful rebound from the financial crisis in China and other
fast-growing markets. These forces may send prices higher still, potentially putting pressure on poor
importing nations.
The International Energy Agency's chief economist said Tuesday that China's needs could drive oil to $110
per barrel by 2015 -- a 27% premium to the current price. Also Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
cut its harvest estimates for soybeans and corn, highlighting growing supply constraints.
"The underlying cause of this is strong emerging-market demand," said Lawrence Eagles, analyst at J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co.
Commodity prices largely continued a march toward new multi-year records. Copper climbed 2.2% Tuesday
and is just pennies from an all-time high. Gold settled at $1,409.80, a new record, and cotton is at its highest
in more than 140 years (though neither is near its inflation-adjusted peak). Corn has risen 22% in less than
six weeks.
Some commodities eased back late Tuesday as investors locked in gains and exchanges indicated they may
start making it costlier to trade raw materials. CME Group, an exchange operator, raised the minimum
collateral investors need to post to trade silver futures: $6,500 per contract, up from $5,000. Silver is up 72%
this year.
The reaction to the CME's move showed how skittish these markets can be. The most actively traded
contract tumbled 7.3% in after-hours trading and sent ripples through other markets. Gold fell after hours, as
did corn and crude oil, which remains near this year's high.
One trend driving the rally: robust demand from China and other emerging markets. Many of these countries
are becoming wealthier, enabling them to buy more consumer goods and build infrastructure. At the same
time, many analysts have questioned whether there is enough supply of key commodities on hand to satisfy
growing demand.
Suppliers of metals like copper cut back production during the financial crisis -- a pipeline that can take years
to fill again. And brutal droughts and floods in Russia and Pakistan have dramatically reduced harvests,
raising concerns about potential shortages and the possible impact of price spikes on the world's poorest
consumers.
Layered onto those fundamental forces is a wave of fresh money being pumped into the markets by the Fed.
The Fed's latest $600 billion bond-buying plan is pushing yields on those bonds even lower, luring investors
to assets that may offer better returns. Many are buying commodities, through futures markets and
exchange-traded funds. Investors had a record $320 billion parked in commodities as of September, says
Barclays Capital.
Treasury prices, in part, reflect the shift. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond tumbled almost 2% Tuesday,
pushing its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price, up to 4.25%, the highest since June 3.
The run-up is aided by the U.S. dollar's sustained fall, which further boosts commodities typically priced in the
greenback.

"People are worried about the currency and don't know what to make of the environment, so they are heading
for the hills, which involves investing in hard commodities which they can put away," said Wayne Atwell,
managing director of Casimir Capital, an investment bank specializing in commodities.
Yet the impact of U.S. monetary policy overseas also points to a risk that raw-material prices could stall or
reverse. A weaker dollar may boost U.S. exports, but it could also undercut exports from rival nations -- and
thus trim their demand for materials. Pricier commodities can also stoke fears of inflation in countries where
concern is already high.
China is set to release its consumer price index for October on Thursday, and analysts expect it will top 4%,
higher than September's 3.6%. China recently raised interest rates, and a top Chinese central banker, Ma
Delun, said Tuesday China won't leave inflation unchecked.
If emerging-market interest rates rise broadly, some gains spurred by the Fed "will be erased," said Harry
Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas.
The steep price hikes harken back to the first half of 2008, when oil, copper and other commodities rocketed
to what proved to be unsustainable highs. When the U.S. real estate bubble burst and economies reeled,
commodities plummeted.
The current price spikes also serve as a warning: If the U.S. economy does recover, miners, drillers and
farmers may struggle to keep up with demand.
The International Energy Agency expects Middle East demand for crude oil to rise 4.1% this year, and Latin
American demand to climb 4.7%. Oil prices remain well below all-time highs hit in July 2008, and supplies
appear relatively strong for now.
Copper, on the other hand, is in a "secular bull market" due to strong demand growth from China and delays
in bringing new mines to production, said Mr. Atwell of Casimir Capital.
Food markets also look tight. China will probably buy about one-third of the U.S. soybean crop, and the
USDA said Tuesday inventories of corn and soybeans will fall sharply ahead of the 2011 harvest.
Prices for both crops are up this year, with corn rising 39% and soybeans 27%. The thin supplies and high
prices are striking because the U.S. soybean crop is still forecast to be a record, while the corn crop is
expected to be the third-largest ever.
The world's total grain reserves are still bigger than in 2007 and 2008, when soaring costs sparked riots and
street protests across some parts of the world. Harvests of rice, a staple for the world's poor, are also at
record highs, helping keep prices low.

Corrections & Amplifications
The first name of Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh was incorrectly given as Ken in a Tuesday
front-page article about the backlash against the Fed's bond-buying program.
(WSJ November 13, 2010)
(END)
NEW DELHI -- Global controversy mounted over the Federal Reserve's decision to pump billions of dollars
into the U.S. economy, with President Barack Obama defending the move as China, Russia and the euro
zone added to a chorus of criticism.
Mr. Obama returned fire in the growing confrontation over trade and currencies Monday in a joint news
conference with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, taking the unusual step of publicly backing the Fed's
decision to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds -- a move that has come under withering international
criticism for weakening the U.S. dollar.
The Fed is independent, and the White House by longstanding tradition has strained to avoid any
appearance of collusion or conflict. Mr. Obama said the administration doesn't comment on particular actions
of the U.S. central bank, before adding: "I will say that the Fed's mandate, my mandate, is to grow our
economy. And that's not just good for the United States, that's good for the world as a whole."
The prospects of the Fed flooding the financial system with money helped drive gold above $1,400 an ounce
on Monday. The precious metal, which investors often buy as protection against inflation, settled at a record
$1,402.80 per troy ounce. Other assets, such as U.S. stocks and oil, drifted back slightly on Monday after
getting a big boost from the Fed's announcement last week. The dollar fell against the yen, while rising
against the euro as worries about Europe's debt problems returned.
The G-20 summit that begins Wednesday night in Seoul is shaping up as a showdown between exporting
powers, such as Germany and China, and nations such as the U.S. that are struggling to emerge from
recession and high unemployment.
Ahead of the meeting, tensions have flared in particular between German and U.S. officials. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner has been pressing member nations to sign up for a framework that would set
limits on countries' trade balances. Germany, which relies heavily on exports, has lectured Washington about
its economic policies, which Berlin sees as profligate and damaging.
Already, expectations are low for the meeting. The G-20 is struggling to agree on specific targets for Mr.
Geithner's trade regime. It's also likely to leave unresolved other big questions, such as how to unwind failing
international financial institutions, a task made urgent by the recent financial crisis.
Mr. Geithner said he is "very confident" world leaders, including those from China, will agree on a new
framework that could instead include warning indicators for when a country's trade balance is out of line.
Germany's criticism echoes that from other countries, including Brazil and Japan, which have complained
about potential spillover from the Fed's action. Printing more dollars, or cutting U.S. interest rates, tends to
weaken the dollar and makes U.S. exports more attractive. The accompanying rise in the value of other
countries' currencies tends to damp their exports and can fuel inflation or asset bubbles, as emerging-market
officials note. U.S. officials maintain the Fed's action is about stimulating domestic demand, and that a
weaker dollar is a consequence, not an objective.

On Monday, China's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said the U.S. isn't living up to its responsibility as
an issuer of a global reserve currency. The Fed's move doesn't "take into account the effect of this excessive
liquidity on emerging-market economies," he said.
The top economic aide to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia will insist at the G-20 summit that
the Fed consult with other countries ahead of major policy decisions.
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who is chairman of the euro-zone finance ministers, also
weighed in on the Fed move, saying: "I don't think it's a good decision. You're fighting debt with more debt."
Dissenting voices emerged in the U.S., too. Federal Reserve governor Ken Warsh, a top lieutenant of Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, expressed deep skepticism about the Fed's action in an opinion piece in
this newspaper. On Monday, Sarah Palin took aim at the Fed, calling on Mr. Bernanke to "cease and desist"
on the bond-buying program. Ms. Palin said, "It's far from certain this will even work" and suggested the move
would create an inflation problem.
Over the weekend, Mr. Bernanke said, "We see an economy which has a very high level of underutilization of
resources and a relatively slow growth rate. The standard considerations suggest we should be using
expansionary monetary policy, and that was the purpose of the action" taken last week.
Underpinning the debate is a growing sense that the international currency system, which has been based on
floating exchange rates for most players for more than 30 years, is wearing out. China's policy of keeping its
currency artificially low has long caused tensions that have increased of late, as other countries try to export
their economies back to health. Now critics are lumping the Fed's policy, known as quantitative easing, into
the same category.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble lashed out at U.S. pressure on Berlin to rein in the country's
surging exports, telling Der Spiegel magazine, "The American growth model . . . is stuck in a deep crisis."
He said, "It doesn't add up when the Americans accuse the Chinese of currency manipulation and then, with
the help of their central bank's printing presses, artificially lower the value of the dollar."
Observers said the blunt criticism of U.S. policy is in large part payback for a longstanding stance by
Washington policy makers that the American economy should serve as a model for others. The heated
rhetoric also stems from fears that the U.S. may be looking for a back-door way to set exchange-rate policy in
a way that favors the U.S.
In his first public comments since Mr. Schauble's outburst, Mr. Obama seemed set to keep the heat on both
Germany and China. "We can't continue to sustain a situation in which some countries are maintaining
massive [trade] surpluses, others massive deficits, and there never is the kind of adjustments with respect to
currency that would lead to a more balanced growth pattern."
Germany's trade surplus shot up to 16.8 billion euros ($23.37 billion) in September from 9 billion euros in
August, Germany's federal statistics office reported Monday -- larger than the 12 billion euros economists had
expected.
Mr. Obama enlisted an ally in Mr. Singh, an economist whose country is wielding increasing influence at the
G-20. Responding to Mr. Schauble's criticism of the Fed, the prime minister said, "Anything that stimulates
the underlying growth impulses of entrepreneurship in the United States would help the cause of global
prosperity."
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, after a regular meeting with other central-bank
heads Monday, said: "Absolutely no participants mentioned that they were pursuing any kind of
weak-currency policies." He said the Fed gave the committee a "very precise exposition" of its new policy, but
said there was no judgment of, or vote on, its action.

Palin's Dollar and Zoellick's Gold
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Palin's Dollar and Zoellick's Gold

It would be hard to find two more unlikely intellectual comrades than Robert Zoellick, the World Bank
technocrat, and Sarah Palin, the populist conservative politician. But in separate interventions yesterday, the
pair roiled the global monetary debate in complementary and timely fashion.
The former Alaskan Governor showed sound political and economic instincts by inveighing forcefully against
the Federal Reserve's latest round of quantitative easing. According to the prepared text of remarks that she
released to National Review online, Mrs. Palin also exhibited a more sophisticated knowledge of monetary
policy than any major Republican this side of Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan.
Stressing the risks of Fed "pump priming," Mrs. Palin zeroed in on the connection between a "weak dollar -- a
direct result of the Fed's decision to dump more dollars onto the market" -- and rising oil and food prices. She
also noted the rising world alarm about the Fed's actions, which by now includes blunt comments by
Germany, Brazil, China and most of Asia, among many others.
"We don't want temporary, artificial economic growth brought at the expense of permanently higher inflation
which will erode the value of our incomes and our savings," the former GOP Vice Presidential nominee said.
"We want a stable dollar combined with real economic reform. It's the only way we can get our economy back
on the right track."
Mrs. Palin's remarks may have the beneficial effect of bringing the dollar back to the center of the American
political debate, not to mention of the GOP economic platform. Republican economic reformers of the 1970s
and 1980s -- especially Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp -- understood the importance of stable money to U.S.
prosperity.
On the other hand, the Bush Administration was clueless. Its succession of Treasury Secretaries promoted
dollar devaluation little different from that of the current Administration, while the White House ignored or
applauded an over-easy Fed policy that created the credit boom and housing bubble that led to financial
panic.
Misguided monetary policy can ruin an Administration as thoroughly as higher taxes and destructive
regulation, and the new GOP majority in the House and especially the next GOP President need to be alert to
the dangers. Mrs. Palin is way ahead of her potential Presidential competitors on this policy point, and she
shows a talent for putting a technical subject in language that average Americans can understand.
Which brings us to Mr. Zoellick, who exceeded even Mrs. Palin's daring yesterday by mentioning the word
"gold" in the orthodox Keynesian company of the Financial Times. This is like mentioning the name "Palin" in
the Princeton faculty lounge.
Mr. Zoellick, who worked at the Treasury under James Baker in the 1980s, laid out an agenda for a new
global monetary regime to reduce currency turmoil and spur growth: "This new system is likely to need to
involve the dollar, the euro, the yen, the pound and a renminbi that moves toward internalization and then an
open capital account," he wrote, in an echo of what we've been saying for some time.
And here's Mr. Zoellick's sound-money kicker: "The system should also consider employing gold as an
international reference point of market expectations about inflation, deflation and future currency values.
Although textbooks may view gold as the old money, markets are using gold as an alternative monetary
asset today." Mr. Zoellick's last observation will not be news to investors, who have traded gold up to $1,400
an ounce, its highest level in real terms since the 1970s, as a hedge against the risk of future inflation.
However, his point will shock many of the world's financial policy makers, who still think of gold as a
barbarous relic rather than as an important price signal. Lest they faint in the halls of the International
Monetary Fund, we don't think Mr. Zoellick is calling for a return to a full-fledged gold standard. His
nonetheless useful point is that a system of global monetary cooperation needs a North Star to judge when it

--- Page 108 ---
Page 108 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
is running off course. The Bretton Woods accord used gold as such a reference until the U.S. failed to heed
its discipline in the late 1960s and in 1971 revoked the pledge to sell other central banks gold at $35 an
ounce.
One big problem in the world economy today is the frequent and sharp movement in exchange rates,
especially between the euro and dollar. This distorts trade and investment flows and leads to a misallocation
of capital and trade tensions. A second and related problem is the desire of the Obama Administration and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to devalue the dollar to boost exports as a way to compensate for
the failed spending stimulus.
As recently as this week in India, Mr. Obama said that "We can't continue situations where some countries
maintain massive [trade] surpluses, other countries have massive deficits and never is there an adjustment
with respect to currency that would lead to a more balanced growth pattern."
If this isn't a plea for a weaker dollar in the name of balancing trade flows, what is it? The world knows the
Fed can always win such a currency race to the bottom in the short run because it can print an unlimited
supply of dollars. But the risks of currency war and economic instability are enormous.
---
In their different ways, Mrs. Palin and Mr. Zoellick are offering a better policy path: More careful monetary
policy in the U.S., and more U.S. leadership abroad with a goal of greater monetary cooperation and less
volatile exchange rates. If Mr. Obama is looking for advice on this beyond Mr. Zoellick, he might consult Paul
Volcker or Nobel laureate Robert Mundell. A chance for monetary reform is a terrible thing to waste.

NEW YORK -- Stocks slipped Monday as reignited concerns over European sovereign debt gave investors
reason to pause after last week's climb.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 37.24 points, or 0.33%, at 11406.84, snapping a six-day
winning streak. Travelers was the measure's worst performer, falling 86 cents, or 1.50%, to $56.58.
Verizon Communications shed 26 cents, or 0.8%, to 33.17, after Verizon Wireless, the company's joint
venture with Vodafone, began testing a new price point on an unlimited plan, seen as another sign of pricing
pressure in the wireless business.
The Nasdaq Composite edged up 1.07, or 0.04%, to 2580.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed
2.60, or 0.21% to 1223.25, ending a five-session run of gains.
Investors paused Monday as the market digested the Dow's 2.9% climb last week that brought the measure
to highs not seen since prior to the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
The measure is up about 14% from late August, with much of the rally fueled by expectations for the
Republican Party's win of control of the House last week, and the Federal Reserve's pledge to inject more
money into the economy.
"The quantitative easing from our Fed should benefit commodities and commodity-oriented sectors," said
Tom Samuelson, chief investment officer at Advanced Equities Asset Management. Materials and energy
were the strongest sectors on Monday.
Some investors fretted rising energy and commodity prices could lead to inflation. In a defensive move, the
spot price of gold settled above $1,400 per ounce for the first time.
Investors are wondering whether the market may have overdone the impacts of the election and stimulus
move, dubbed by Wall Street as QE2.
Traders kept a close eye on currencies as President Obama, returning fire in a heated exchange with
Germany, added his voice to U.S. efforts to reduce massive German and Chinese trade surpluses and
increase pressure on China to let the value of its currency rise.
"It's not surprising," said Michael Church, president of Addison Capital. "Everyone wants to try to export their
way to growth and the dynamics of that are that that's impossible to happen, so you're going to have some
infighting here."
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet tried Monday to calm the argument over
foreign-exchange policies, dismissing suggestions that the world's major powers are deliberately weakening
their currencies.
Among stocks in focus, AOL jumped 1.18, or 4.7%, to 26.10 after The Wall Street Journal reported AOL hired
financial advisers to explore options for the Internet company. The Journal said one option was a possible
tie-up with bigger rival Yahoo, which added 18 cents, or 1.1%, to 16.44.
Radian Group, a private mortgage insurance and risk mitigation provider, fell 1.13, or 11%, to 8.82, after
beginning an underwritten public offering of as much as $350 million of convertible senior notes.
Ashland rose 4.86, or 9.5%, to 55.80, after the specialty-chemicals company said it will sell its distribution
business to the buyout arm of private-equity giant TPG Inc. for $930 million.

CardioNet dropped 17 cents, or 2.9%, to 5.66, after saying it will buy fellow cardiac-devices maker Biotel for
$11 million with the per-share price more than double Friday's close, ending litigation between the two.
Shares of Biotel surged 2.22, or 148%, to 3.72.
Chinese steel company operator General Steel Holdings slid 20 cents, or 6.8%, to 2.76, after reporting
third-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst expectations and reporting a per-share loss for the quarter.
Medical lab-equipment maker Immucor climbed 84 cents, or 4.7%, to 18.73, after the antitrust division of the
U.S. Department of Justice dropped its investigation into the company over possible violations of antitrust
laws in the blood reagents industry.

The Currency Conflict: The Search for a New System --- Dollar's Reserve Role Causes Angst, but
Alternatives Fall Flat; Some Seek a Multicurrency Option

More than 60 years after the victors in World War II devised new rules for currencies at Bretton Woods, N.H.,
and more than 30 years after Richard Nixon blew up that regime, the search is on for a new way to manage
the tensions that come from countries using their own national currencies.
But there is more agreement on the shortcomings of the current regime, in which currencies trade relatively
freely against each other, than on what should replace it.
The arguments aren't new. They recall debates at Bretton Woods between Britain's John Maynard Keynes
and the U.S.'s Harry Dexter White. Back then, the U.S. had a big trade surplus, Britain was a big borrower
and global financial heavyweight and China was inconsequential. Today, the U.S. has the big trade deficit
and is the big borrower, China has the big surplus and Britain is on the sidelines.
The latest spark for angst about global currencies was the Federal Reserve's decision to print $600 billion
more to buy U.S. Treasurys. A byproduct of that decision is likely to be a weaker U.S. dollar.
Despite Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's efforts to explain that the move was intended to strengthen the U.S.
economy to the benefit of all, he drew criticism from many quarters -- including Monday from Republican
Sarah Palin and the prime minister of Luxembourg. Posturing officials around the world in advance of this
week's summit of leaders from the Group of 20 major economies in Seoul have added to the fireworks.
The president of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, a veteran of both Bush administrations, jumped into the
fray Monday with an eyebrow-raising op-ed piece in the Financial Times that suggested a back-to-the-future
approach: Tying global currencies to gold.
"The scope of the changes since 1971 certainly matches those between 1945 and 1971 that prompted the
shift from Bretton Woods," he wrote. "Although textbooks may view gold as the old money, markets are using
gold as an alternative monetary asset today."
While a return to the gold standard is unlikely -- and, in the view of scholars who see the rigidities of the gold
standard as a contributor to the Great Depression, unwise -- the suggestion underscored widespread
discomfort with today's arrangements.
At its root, the problem is that the use of the dollar for trade in everything from bonds to oil gives the currency
an outsize role in the world economy, and makes the world economy sensitive to U.S. domestic monetary
policy. As Nixon Treasury Secretary John Connally famously put it: "Our currency, your problem."
The French, who will head up the G-20 next year, have vowed to devise an alternative.
"It's in everyone's interest that the U.S. continues to grow, but everyone is aware of their responsibilities and
no one wants excessive volatility on currency markets," an official from the Elysee Palace told reporters
recently.
One solution, the French said, is to diversify global reserves away from the dollar and create a new
"framework of coordination."
Back in 1969, amid tension between the dollar's peg to gold and what was -- by the standards of the day -- a
large budget deficit, an alternative to the dollar was created. Known as Special Drawing Rights, and overseen
by the International Monetary Fund, this dollar substitute plays little role outside official transactions.
In 1971, President Nixon severed the dollar's tie to gold altogether, moving the world toward a regime in
which markets, with occasional intervention from governments, set exchange rates in nearly every major
economy -- except China.

--- Page 112 ---

Today's debate, and speculation that the U.S. has peaked as a world economic power, has led to predictions
that the dollar inevitably will surrender its role as the world's reserve currency.
So far, though, there doesn't appear to be a better alternative.
Markets aren't confident that the euro will exist in a decade's time, markets for Japanese yen aren't nearly
large enough or liquid enough, and the Chinese are hesitant to assume the hassles that accompany the use
of a country's currency as a store of value and medium of exchange around the world.
Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California at Berkeley, argues that the world
may end up with more than one full-fledged international currency. The old logic -- that importers and
exporters want a common unit of account and that both official and private investors will rely on the currency
with the most liquid markets -- is outdated, he says.
The notion that importers, exporters and bond traders all need to use the same currency "holds less weight in
a world where everyone has a mobile phone that can compare currency values in real time," he says. The
global economy is now so big "there is now room for deep and liquid markets in more than one currency."
And then there's history. Before 1914, there were three international currencies: the British pound, the French
franc, and the German mark.

DWS Fund Takes a Different Path --- Managers Use Commodity Swaps Backed by the Safety of Short-Term Bonds
Fund Track
DWS Fund Takes a Different Path --- Managers Use Commodity Swaps Backed by the Safety of
Short-Term Bonds

Trying to appeal to investors seeking direct exposure to metals and other natural resources and wanting to
look beyond stocks, DWS Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund (trading symbol: SKNRX) invests in a blend
of commodity swaps backed by short-duration bonds.
Fund managers Darwei Kung and Bill Chepolis decide how much exposure they want in commodities and
overweight the assets that look cheap based on a comparison of short- and long-term prices. They use
swaps and futures contracts to gain exposure to the commodities market and also invest in bonds that serve
as collateral for the commodities positions. The actively managed fund can adjust its exposure to
commodities depending on market conditions.
"We're finding a lot of interest in the space, but most people already own stock in the largest commodity
companies," says Mr. Kung. "So, we wanted to do something different."
The fund used to invest in stocks but now looks only at the most liquid resources to minimize risk and to give
investors direct exposure to commodities. The depth and transparency in the gold, oil and aluminum markets
help the portfolio managers follow price changes and find returns. They invest in commodities contracts with
a range of maturities to mitigate market volatility.
Roughly a third of the DWS fund's commodities holdings are in energy swaps, including natural gas, crude oil
and heating oil. Another third is spread between agricultural commodities like corn, soybeans and wheat, with
20% in industrial metals. It also has some exposure to swaps of precious metals, such as gold, and livestock.
A swap is the exchange of one security for another. It is similar to futures contracts, but swaps allow investors
to invest more capital than they are required to hold. The fund has entered into swap agreements with some
big market players, including UBS, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Group. The bonds
with shorter durations protect investors from rising interest rates because they reach maturity within a couple
of years.
Flows into these kinds of funds have been strong this year as investors hedge against future inflation risk
and capitalize on growth in emerging markets, notes Kathryn Young, a mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar.
However, investors need to be mindful of the fixed-income component, which can be a "pretty big driver of
returns," she said. "This isn't a plain-vanilla strategy."
The fund has $681.7 million in assets and a three-star rating from Morningstar. It is up 13.9% year-to-date,
while the Morningstar Long-Only Commodity Index gained 14.75% over the same period, according to the
research firm. The fund fell 7.21% over the past three years as the Morningstar index slipped about 1.68%.
Mr. Chepolis, the 49-year-old manager of the bond unit of DWS Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund, says
he takes a conservative approach to investing to support the returns made by the commodity swaps.
Half of his bond-collateral holdings are in short-term Treasurys, but the fund also has exposure to high-grade
corporate bonds. This compares to typical commodity exchange-traded funds that use only Treasury bills as
collateral. The fund currently holds bonds of Berkshire Hathaway and Duke Power Co.
"Our focus is on commodities, and we try to play it safe with fixed income," notes co-manager Mr. Kung, 41.
"We want to make this as pure a commodities play as possible."

Gold Closes In on $1,400

Gold Closes In on $1,400

Gold inched closer to $1,400 an ounce as traders reconsidered the day's strong jobs report and began
questioning how long increases in employment will last.
That pessimism added to concerns of a more-protracted period of dollar weakness and higher risks of
inflation just two days after the Federal Reserve announced a $600 billion program of Treasury purchases
aimed at stimulating the dragging U.S. economy.
Investors often turn to the yellow metal to protect against the prospect of higher prices. While such inflation
isn't anticipated anytime soon, there are worries the central bank won't be able to sop up the increased
money supply fast enough when the economy does power up.
Friday, the price of the gold futures contract for November delivery rose $14.60, or 1.1%, to $1,397.30 a troy
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. That left it up 3% for the week. The most
actively traded December contract rose $14.60, or 1.1%, to a record $1,397.70 a troy ounce.
The reasons for buying have changed in recent months, but buying remains strong. Investors sought gold as
a perceived refuge from European sovereign-debt worries. More recently, they have sought to hedge
weakening currencies amid worries about governments competing to support their exporters by pressuring
their currencies.
In other commodity markets:
COPPER: Prices set fresh 28-month highs near $4 as the jobs data stirred optimism about demand in the
industrial metal. Falling warehouse inventories and a strike in Chile, the world's largest copper producer, also
lent support. November copper rose 3.75 cents, or 1%, to $3.9440 a pound on Comex.

Gold Leads Surge in Commodities --- Precious Metal Hits a Record as Investors Flee the Dollar

Investors flocked to commodities, pushing gold to a record and oil near a two-year high, amid worries about
the impact of the Federal Reserve's monetary-stimulus plan on the dollar.
The Federal Reserve's decision, announced Wednesday, to spend $600 billion buying Treasury bonds over
eight months jump-started a rally that spanned most commodity markets. The program aims to stimulate the
economy by expanding the money supply, but excess liquidity also could drive up inflation and depreciate
the dollar without generating growth. Either scenario would support higher commodity prices, either by
increasing demand or making dollar-denominated assets cheaper to buy using other currencies.
Front-month November gold futures settled up $45.60, or 3.4%, at $1,382.70 a troy ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. December crude prices settled up $1.80, or 2.1%, at $86.49 a
barrel, its highest settlement in nearly seven months and less than 50 cents below a two-year high. Copper
and corn both soared to their highest levels since the summer of 2008.
"The dollar is under attack and people are moving money from the dollar into other investments," said Ira
Epstein, managing director of the Ira Epstein division at the Linn Group. "Its not just gold, it's commodities
across the board."
The greenback at one point Thursday was at its weakest point against the euro since January. Many
commodities have rallied recently on concerns about tightening supplies, in addition to the potential impact of
the Fed stimulus.
Cotton's surge began over the summer, well before the Fed began hinting at another round of stimulus, when
heavy rain harmed harvests in Pakistan and China. December futures ended 3.6% higher at $1.4045 a
pound, the third consecutive record settlement. Corn prices were up 1.6%, at $5.90 a bushel Thursday as the
market anticipates next week's supply and demand report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which is
expected to include another cut in U.S. production. A month ago, the USDA's reduction in its corn-crop
forecast sent futures up more than 15% in three trading sessions.
Sugar, too, has jumped on worries about dry weather affecting the harvest in Brazil, the world's biggest
exporter. Futures hit a nearly 30-year peak on Thursday, rising 5%, to 31.66 cents a pound.
"International sugar prices still have further room to grow," said Plinio Nastari, president of Datagro, a
consultancy specializing in sugar and ethanol in Sao Paulo.
Even oil, which often has lagged behind other commodities' upward moves due to a persistent glut, may be
becoming scarcer. U.S. combined oil and fuel inventories have begun to drop from a 27-year high over the
last six weeks.
"We anticipate further crude draws lie ahead, which together with a still favorable [economy] should lift prices
into year-end," wrote Hussein Allidina, head of commodity research with Morgan Stanley, in a note where he
predicted oil would surpass $100 a barrel next year.

Dow Hits Pre-Crisis Level --- Central Bank's Spending Binge Stokes Global Rally; 'Don't Fight the Fed'

Global financial markets cheered the Federal Reserve's plans to spur the U.S. economy Thursday, driving
commodity and bond prices higher and propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average to levels last seen before
Lehman Brothers collapsed two years ago.
Interest rates and the dollar tumbled in response to the Fed's decision Wednesday to buy $600 billion of
U.S. Treasury bonds, helping fan fresh rallies in oil, gold and Asian stock markets. Major U.S. companies
including Coca-Cola Co. and Dow Chemical Co. raced to take advantage of the low rates, selling at least $12
billion of new debt.
But the Fed's buying binge raised alarms, too: Officials in Brazil and South Korea criticized the move, saying
it could spark inflation in their economies.
The Dow industrials leapt 219.71 points, or 2%, to 11434.84, its highest close since Sept. 8, 2008, just before
the Lehman bankruptcy filing triggered the most intense phase of the financial crisis.
The blue-chip index is now up 75% from its March 2009 low. But the Dow needs a 24% gain to get back to its
all-time high, set in October 2007, a stark illustration of the damage caused by the crisis and the long road the
economy still must travel.
The Fed's "quantitative easing" policy, unveiled Wednesday, is designed to bolster the economy by keeping
credit easy. The Fed is trying to keep rates on relatively safe Treasurys and cash so puny that investors will
be enticed into riskier assets such as stocks, commodities and corporate bonds, helping inflate their prices.
With their broad rallies in the months before and after the Fed announcement, markets are in some ways
doing the Fed's job by making investors feel richer and more confident -- which in turn can get them to spend
again, which boosts the economy. The thinking goes that the added demand will push prices even higher,
fending off a corrosive bout of deflation, and leading companies to hire again.
"The market's mindset is that everything is good for stocks," said Stephen Ricchiuto, chief economist at
Mizuho Securities USA. "Don't fight the Fed."
Despite the market euphoria, some observers expressed doubt that the Fed's tactics would do much for the
economy and could ultimately end quite badly, by creating asset bubbles or fueling runaway inflation.
"What the Fed is trying to do is reignite the animal spirits of the economy," said Rob Arnott, chairman of
Research Affiliates LLC in Newport Beach, Calif. "They're trying to get people enthusiastic."
Mr. Arnott said he is still skeptical about whether the Fed will succeed. "Unfortunately, if it didn't work with
$1.7 trillion [in bond buying] before, why would it work with $600 billion now?"
The Fed's policy is designed to bolster the U.S. economy, but the effects will be felt all over the world, in part
because it will weaken the U.S. dollar. The greenback fell 0.8% against a basket of major trading currencies
on Thursday, adding to a 14% decline since early June.
Already, officials in emerging-market countries in Asia and Latin America have felt the impact as investors
pour in money, attracted to these nations' higher interest rates and prospects of stronger economic growth.
That in turn has pushed up their currencies, raising their export costs and driving inflation higher.
Partly in response to the prospect of greater growth and liquidity, stock markets in Japan, India and China all
rose about 2% on Thursday, helping build momentum for the U.S. open. South Korea's stock market reached
its highest level since December 2007, and stocks in Brazil rose 1.5%. Markets in Asia also opened higher on
Friday morning.

Still, the Fed's move drew alarm and criticism from emerging-market nations. A senior official at South
Korea's Ministry of Strategy and Finance said the country will "actively seek measures to alleviate" the
volatility stemming from the capital flows. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega called the Fed decision
"an error," saying Brazil will criticize the move at the Group of 20 meeting in Seoul later this month.
Other factors also helped drive U.S. stocks higher throughout the day, some observers said, including hopes
of a compromise between President Barack Obama and the new Congress on taxes, and a Wall Street
Journal report near the end of the day that the Fed could soon let some big banks increase dividends for the
first time since their bailouts during the crisis.
Fed policy has played a big role in driving the stock market's recovery from rock bottom and in pushing bond
prices higher, which in turn makes borrowing costs lower.
Coca-Cola on Thursday sold $4.5 billion in fresh bonds, including three-year debt with an interest rate of just
0.75%. That tied a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. bond issued last month for the lowest borrowing rate for a big
corporate issuer in decades, according to data provider Dealogic.
The weaker dollar, along with the prospect of liquidity-fueled growth around the world, helped turbo-charge
commodity prices. Crude-oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 2.1%, their highest level
since early April. Gold prices surged 3.4% to a record of $1,382.70 per ounce in Comex trading. And silver
prices rose 6.6%, the biggest one-day dollar gain for the metal since December 1980.
Treasury bonds rallied, especially the 10-year note, with yields falling to 2.480%, the lowest since
mid-October. This is a welcome development for the Fed, as lower Treasury yields will help keep mortgage
rates and other borrowing costs low throughout the economy.

The Global Economy: Fed Treads Into a Once-Taboo Realm
The Global Economy: Fed Treads Into a Once-Taboo Realm

The Federal Reserve will print money to buy nearly as much U.S. Treasury debt in the next eight months as
the U.S. government will issue.
The Fed's decision this week to buy $600 billion more of U.S. Treasury debt is setting off a debate about the
risks of a central bank entwining its policies so tightly with the government's fiscal fortunes. The Fed is
essentially lending enough money to the government to fund its operations for several months, something
called "monetizing the debt."
In normal times, this is one of the great taboos of central banking because it is seen as a step toward
spiraling inflation and because it risks encouraging reckless government spending.
The central bank is betting these aren't normal times. Financial markets Thursday responded warmly to the
Fed move, but outspoken critics of the policy issued full-throated critiques.
"It is doubtful the Fed decision will produce any results," Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega told
reporters following a cabinet meeting with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Officials in Brazil,
which averaged 850% annual inflation in the 1990s, have been critical of the Fed's easy-money policies
because they are spurring price pressures abroad and could encourage new asset bubbles outside the U.S.
"Throwing money out of a helicopter doesn't do any good," Mr. Mantega said.
Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and the lone dissenter in Wednesday's
decision, said in an interview Thursday that he worried the Fed would be too slow to reverse the policy and
that would cause new problems.
"Leaving it in there longer than -- in hindsight -- we will think was appropriate, will create the next series of
problems, whatever those are," Mr. Hoenig said.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his allies argue that today's economy is too weak and banks too reluctant
to lend to generate much inflation. They also vow that the Fed will buy bonds only as long as inflation
lingers below the central bank's implicit target of 2%. And they say the purchases are temporary. When the
economy returns to health or if inflation rises much, the Fed plans to stop buying and possibly to sell the
bonds in the market.
Between now and June, the Fed will be purchasing $110 billion of Treasury notes and bonds a month, $75
billion a month in its new program and $35 billion a month to replace mortgage bonds in its portfolio that are
maturing. In the same period, the Treasury will be issuing about $114 billion of new debt each month,
estimates Louis Crandall, an analyst at Wrightson ICAP LLC.
Central banks regularly buy and sell government bonds to influence short-term interest rates, but rarely on
such a large scale to influence long-term rates.
The markets don't seem alarmed. Although commodities and gold prices are rising -- crude-oil prices have
risen 6% in just four days -- bond markets aren't signaling big inflation worries among investors.
Yields on two-year Treasury notes fell to 0.33%, the lowest in more than five decades. The market for
inflation-protected Treasury securities, which compensate investors for future inflation, suggests investors
expect just 1.5% inflation over the next five years, according to calculations by Michael Pond of Barclays
Capital. That is up from 1.15% in August, but still relatively low.
If investors saw a big inflation risk, yields would be higher.

"At the moment, people clearly don't have conviction that there is going to be high inflation because if they
did, the government would be paying much higher interest rates. . . . We wouldn't have the 10-year
borrowing rate at 2.5%," said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University economist.
This isn't the first time the Fed has taken large amounts of U.S. government bonds. In the 1940s, it bought
enough bonds to keep the interest rate the government paid on long-term bonds at 2.25%.
"The Fed was virtually an arm of the Treasury," said Michael Bordo, an economic historian at Rutgers
University. "Its balance sheet was swollen with Treasury securities, like today."
Annual inflation during the 1940s averaged 5%, driven by a temporary burst following World War II. The peg
was ended in an accord between the Fed and the Treasury in 1951, and inflation slowed to less than 2%
until the late 1960s.
The central bank is independent today and its officials note that the Treasury isn't demanding that the Fed
buy government debt. Fed officials say that puts them in a position to sell the bonds when they want to.

Gold prices whipsawed in after-market trading, after the Federal Open Market Committee announced its
Treasurys purchasing program.
The committee announced plans to buy $600 billion in long-term Treasury bonds by the first quarter of 2011,
a pace of about $75 billion a month. The committee also will keep short-term interest rates near zero for an
"extended period."
The news sent gold futures oscillating around their settlement price, before paring earlier losses. "We had a
lot of nervous liquidation in the markets today," said Bill O'Neill, a principal with Logic Advisors. "This is just
noise, all the factors driving gold higher are still intact."
Gold for November delivery settled down $19.30, or 1.4%, at $1,337.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold has much to gain from the Federal Reserve stimulus, said Credit Suisse precious metals analyst Tom
Kendall. A larger Federal Reserve balance sheet will weigh down market confidence in U.S. economic policy,
while higher inflation and expectations will encourage more investors to seek safe harbor in gold. Moreover,
the program implies that interest rates will remain near zero for some time, making interest-bearing assets
like bonds less attractive compared with gold.

SYDNEY -- Amid the gloom hanging over the U.S. housing market, Australia continues to defy critics who say
one of the world's few property hot spots is overdue for a correction.
Another test will come at the landmark Sydney Opera House on Monday, when real-estate agency Ray White
Ltd. holds an auction of 11 luxury dwellings, 10 in New South Wales, one in Queensland. The firm hopes the
iconic venue will help persuade the invited bidders, mainly Asian, to snap up the properties, some for as
much as 10 million Australian dollars ($9.9 million).
"Compared with the U.S., our market has not been hit by an atomic bomb," said Brian White, chairman of Ray
White, which last year sold A$23 billion of mostly residential and commercial property in Australia.
Australian real-estate agencies are drawing Russian and Chinese investors with online advertisements
showing rooftop pools and panoramic harbor views. Demand is so strong that in April the government moved
to cool what it believed was an overheating in foreign real-estate investment by tightening restrictions. Mr.
White is quick to dismiss fears that Sydney or other booming Australian cities like Melbourne could be
heading for a crash: "Branded" developments in Australia -- such as Hilton condominiums on the Gold Coast
-- will always appeal to foreign investors, he said.
Foreign demand isn't the only engine. Home sales are propped up by an economy that the International
Monetary Fund forecasts will expand by 3.5% in 2011, driven by China's demand for its vast reserves of coal
and iron ore. Property enthusiasm is running high. Organizers said 10,000 people gathered at the Sydney
Home Buyer and Property Investors Show last week to hear expert advice on how to cash in. Among those in
attendance was property investor and farmer Paul Morton -- he tends 30,000 ducks on his place in New
South Wales -- who said he isn't concerned that prices may be overdone.
"Property has been a real good investment for me," said Mr. Morton, who wants to add to his existing portfolio
of three rental properties in the Sydney area. "No reason to think that will change."
Gerard Minack, chief Australian economist at investment bank Morgan Stanley, sees it differently. "The
economics of these prices simply don't add up," he said. "You're now buying an asset where the yield doesn't
even cover the financing cost." And the IMF's latest assessment of the Australian economy warns that
real-estate prices could be heading for a 15% correction.
There are signs of overheating. Prices in Australia have quadrupled in a little more than 20 years, and the
average home in Sydney now costs A$200,000 more than its counterpart in Greater New York and nearly as
much as in Honolulu or San Jose, Calif., according to a calculation from data drawn from the National
Association of Realtors in the U.S. and the Real Estate Institute of Australia.
Mr. Minack says buyers are in some cases paying as much as 40% above fair value to gain a foothold on the
property ladder. Average Australians are increasingly being priced out. According to an international
housing-affordability survey, from the Wendell Cox Consultancy, the country has the highest ratio of home
prices to gross median household income in the world. And home loans, already among the most expensive
in the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations, are set to become costlier following the Reserve Bank of
Australia's 0.25-percentage-point increase in its key cash rate on Tuesday, to 4.75%. Commonwealth Bank of
Australia quickly raised its variable mortgage rates 0.45 percentage point to 7.81%, and the country's three
other large banks are weighing similar increases.
Tanya Butorac, a 30-year-old receptionist from the outlying Sydney neighborhood of Glenfield, is one of many
first-time buyers feeling the pinch of the real-estate boom. She scraped together a mortgage deposit last year

Doubts Cloud Gold's Bright Future --- Demand Has Overwhelmed Fundamentals; Supplies Up, Jewelry Sales Down

Doubts Cloud Gold's Bright Future --- Demand Has Overwhelmed Fundamentals; Supplies Up,
Jewelry Sales Down

NEW YORK -- The outlook for gold prices is tarnished by the erosion of several longstanding factors that
have proved supportive for the yellow metal in the past.
While that doesn't spell the end for the rally given investors' intense desire to hold gold, the situation leaves
prices even more exposed to the whims of investor sentiment.
"Investment demand," which can range from money managers buying futures as a currency hedge to
inflation-fearing retail buyers snapping up coins from national mints, has overwhelmed fundamental
supply-and-demand factors that gold bulls often cite in supporting their views. It is the rising demand from
investors that sent gold to a record settlement of $1,376.70 a troy ounce in mid-October.
Gold subsequently fell 4% from that peak before mounting a recovery as investors await word on Federal
Reserve monetary stimulus efforts, expected to be announced Wednesday.
Nearby futures gained $6.20, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,356.40 Tuesday.
While investors view gold more as a financial asset, "what tilts investors to participate or not participate is
their analysis of what's happening fundamentally," said Carlos Sanchez, CPM Group's associate director of
research.
Any support these factors previously provided is deteriorating. Mining companies largely have unwound their
price hedges through the purchase of gold, so they are no longer big buyers in the market. Jewelry sales are
lagging due to high prices. And global supplies are up as miners dig more and as people sell their physical
gold to take advantage of high prices.
This leaves gold's trajectory almost completely at the mercy of hedge funds, institutions and investors in
exchange-traded funds, which now hold more gold than many central banks, opening the door to increased
volatility.
"I've seen a divorce from fundamentals," said Jon Nadler, an analyst at Montreal bullion dealer Kitco Metals.
"Investment demand must run hard just to make the market stand still."
This year, total gold supply will total 115.7 million ounces, with 39.8 million ounces going toward investment
demand, according to projections from New York commodities consultancy CPM Group. Investors accounted
for only 15.5 million ounces in 2000. Over the same period, fabrication demand -- including jewelry, which
makes up the lion's share of physical gold demand -- has fallen from 104.3 million ounces to a projected
66.9 million ounces this year.
Imports by India, the world's largest buyer of physical gold, during January to September are estimated to be
9% lower year-on-year at 212.6 metric tons, according to the Bombay Bullion Association.

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Mixing It Up: A Focus on Preservation --- Adviser Mitchell
Eichen looks for funds that deliver more yield than conventional bonds, while also aiming to limit
stock-market risk

Low rates, muted expectations and still-fresh scars have led many investors to reconsider their priorities in
recent years. Mitchell Eichen, a financial planner based in Morristown, N.J., says his clients are a lot more
focused on preserving their wealth than on earning the highest return.
So, that's what he helps them do: protect their capital while earning decent returns.
For his clients, Mr. Eichen buys a mix of mutual funds that invest in some dividend-paying stocks, low-quality
or unrated bonds and master limited partnerships, or MLPs (limited partnerships that trade on a securities
exchange).
"You're not getting yield from the traditional bond market, so we have to go elsewhere," says Mr. Eichen, who
expects his income-oriented funds to generate yields of between 5% and 6.5% this year.
His yield-focused investments have good potential for capital appreciation as well, he says, which is key since
he expects only modest gains from the broad stock market for the near future.
However, because of the conservative picks and hedging strategies that Mr. Eichen and his team favor, their
clients can expect to forgo dramatic gains, even in the event of a market rally similar to that of 2009, when
stocks surged some 60% after bottoming in March.
Mr. Eichen says individuals always need to assess the risk of high-yielding investments before buying. With
the 10-year Treasury note yielding only about 2.6%, "each one of these [investments he makes] has a yield
above normal fixed-income yields for a reason," he says. For instance, bonds with low ratings and high yields,
or junk bonds, can tank when the economy deteriorates or stocks fall.
In this column, we feature model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds. Mr. Eichen has been ranked among top advisers by Barron's magazine (published by
News Corp.'s Dow Jones & Co., which also publishes The Wall Street Journal). He founded MDE Group Inc.
in 1987, and the firm currently manages $1.3 billion in assets, primarily for very wealthy individuals.
He and his team also have two proprietary investment strategies that use ETFs and options not only to
protect against losses but to leverage market gains under the right conditions. One strategy, for example, is
designed to not lose value if the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falls as much as 12% in a year. In
addition, returns are expected to outperform index gains of up to roughly 11%. If the S&P were up 5%, clients
would earn 10%, Mr. Eichen says, and if 9%, they would earn 11%.
If the stock market comes roaring back, however, Mr. Eichen says his clients would capture only part of the
gains; an increase of 15% in the S&P, for example, would yield an 11% gain using his firm's strategy.
Mr. Eichen says that giving up some part of large gains is the cost that his clients pay for the certainty of their
gain or loss scenario. Investment banks for years have offered similar structured products, which protect
investors on the downside while promising to double their gains -- up to a limit. He notes that his strategies
don't carry bank credit risk, and that his clients have access to the underlying investments.
His strategies generate short-term capital gains, or losses, and can't be held in tax-deferred individual
retirement accounts. "In this new world environment," he says, "we think generating returns takes precedence
over tax efficiency." But so far he has been offsetting clients' gains with losses from the downturn in 2008 and
early 2009.
His firm charges a fee of 1.2% a year on money managed in proprietary strategies, 0.24% for the investment
in a high-quality municipal-bond fund and 0.8% for the remaining portfolio.

--- Page 130 ---
Page 130 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Here, Mr. Eichen shares a model portfolio suited for investors with a moderate risk appetite. Since some
strategies and funds are less than a year old, it does not have a complete performance track record.
STOCKS: There is a 40% allocation to stocks, three-fourths of which is invested using the ETF-and-options
strategies. The other fourth is divided evenly between two mutual funds: Cullen High Dividend Equity, which
buys dividend-paying stocks that the managers believe to be trading at very low prices based on their
earnings; and Harding Loevner Global Equity, which buys high-quality U.S. and international stocks.
HIGH-QUALITY BONDS AND CASH: Some 13% of the portfolio is in cash and funds that buy high-quality
bonds. A 6% allocation is in Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income, which buys high-quality municipal bonds
of five years or less duration. Another 6% is in Pimco Total Return, which buys various types of high-quality
short-term and medium-term bonds and uses complex derivative strategies to goose returns. The remaining
1% is in a money-market fund.
HYBRID/OTHER BONDS: Mr. Eichen commits 30% of the portfolio to funds that buy other kinds of bonds,
including bonds with lower credit ratings; funds that invest in master limited partnerships; and hybrid funds
that mix bonds, stocks and other investments such as precious metals and currencies.
To generate income and provide growth, some funds in this category include low-quality bonds or those
issued by developing countries. He allocates 6% to Loomis Sayles Bond, which recently had a fourth of its
money in junk bonds. The fund's yield is currently 5.4%, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. Another
6% is in Nuveen High Yield Municipal Bond, which buys bonds issued by unrated and other municipalities
and now has a tax-free yield of 6.9%, according to Morningstar.
Six percent also goes to SteelPath MLP Alpha, which provides exposure to energy-infrastructure MLPs and
recently had a yield of around 6%. Unlike bonds, whose prices rise and fall in line with changes in interest
rates, these partnerships' values respond indirectly to demand for oil and gas, thus providing a different "risk
exposure" for the portfolio, says Mr. Eichen.
Two funds own stocks, bonds and other investments. One is Permanent Portfolio, which has a 6% allocation
and buys gold, silver and Swiss francs as well as stocks and bonds. The other, also at 6%, is FPA Crescent,
which holds lots of cash and owns stocks and bonds that can be converted to stocks.
ALTERNATIVES: There is a 17% allocation to alternative funds, which typically aim to provide positive
returns even in declining markets. Some of these funds buy stocks but also engage in shorting, or selling a
borrowed stock in hopes that its price will fall, allowing it to be purchased later at a lower price.
Mr. Eichen expects these funds to provide bondlike stability but with better returns. However, in recent
months he has not been happy with the returns of some of these funds. He says that over time he'll cut back
on these holdings and will increase the allocation to his firm's proprietary strategies, which he says carry less
risk of a manager making a bad investment.
For now, 5% of the portfolio is in AQR Diversified Arbitrage, which uses merger, convertible and other forms
of arbitrage, and rates its performance against a benchmark of short-term U.S. government bonds. And 4%
each is in Highbridge Statistical Market Neutral; JPMorgan Strategic Income Opportunities, which invests in
bonds, cash and derivatives; and TFS Market Neutral, which aims for lower volatility than a traditional stock
fund.

Stocks, Dollar in Rare Sync --- Unusual Mirror-Image Moves Come as Markets Await Fed's Easing Measures

Stocks, Dollar in Rare Sync --- Unusual Mirror-Image Moves Come as Markets Await Fed's Easing
Measures

The latest mantra on Wall Street: stocks up, dollar down.
Historically, moves by stocks and the currency have tended to show no relationship.
But since the stock market bottomed in July and the Federal Reserve started leaning toward policies that
have pushed down the dollar, the two asset classes have been moving against each other, raising eyebrows
among many analysts and investors.
Joseph Mezrich, a quantitative research analyst at Nomura Securities, calls the trend "astonishing" and says
he hasn't seen such a strong relationship, or correlation, between stocks and the dollar since Richard Nixon
took the dollar off the gold standard in 1971.
"It's pretty remarkable," Mr. Mezrich said. "One of the things that's really bothered equity investors is that
everything is moving together."
According to his calculations, the correlation between the two asset classes has been negative 0.60 over the
past four months, compared to a long-term correlation of positive 0.04 -- an essentially flat reading that
denotes a near-absence of synchronicity. A correlation of positive 1.0 means assets are moving in perfect
lockstep, while a correlation of negative 1.0 means they are going in exactly opposite directions.
The dollar and stocks have become increasingly correlated since the financial crisis, as central-bank
monetary policies, worries about Europe's debt woes or China's economy dominate investors' attention. But
the connection right now is so stark that it is drawing more scrutiny.
Art Cashin, director of floor trading at UBS AG, laments that he's spent years figuring out the markets, but
none of his accumulated wisdom matters right now.
"After decades of honing skills of interpreting the likes of geopolitical events, economic data, and technical
levels, things were reduced to a single item," the dollar, Mr. Cashin wrote in a note last week. "Not much of
an intellectual challenge there."
While there is debate about who is leading who, there is little doubt that stocks and the dollar are responding
to the same influence: the Federal Reserve.
The dollar has been falling, and stocks rising, as investors prepare for a round of stimulus measures by the
Fed, expected to be announced after a meeting of policy makers next week.
Concerns about dollar dilution, and the longer-term prospects of inflation, have pushed the dollar down 6.9%
against a basket of six currencies since Aug. 27, when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke first signaled plans to
engage in a new round of so-called quantitative easing in which the central bank buys U.S. assets.
At the same time, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has surged 13.1%.
Last week, the dollar declined slightly, while stocks were slightly up.
The U.S. Dollar Index closed the week at 77.18, near its lowest point of the year, and the S&P 500 ended at
1183.26, not far from its highest point of 2010.
The falling dollar can be good for stocks because it pumps up commodity prices -- lending a boost to U.S.
companies in the industrials, energy and materials sector, which have grown in importance on the stock
market in recent years. A lower dollar is also good for exporting companies.

--- Page 133 ---
Page 133 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The relationship is especially in focus as investors gear up for what could be a volatile week of trading next
week: Tuesday brings the midterm U.S. congressional election; on Wednesday the Fed is expected to
announce its easing plans; Friday will see the release of the closely watched monthly U.S. nonfarm-payrolls
report.
Many investors and market watchers say the relationship can't last, and that stocks and the dollar, which
historically haven't taken many of their cues from one another, will soon separate.
How and when that happens likely depends on investors' reactions to the Fed's steps.
Another scenario is that better economic data boosts stocks while allowing the Fed to take a modest
approach to quantitative easing. That could keep the equity rally rolling and enable the dollar to rise.
"You'd like to see a scenario where there are positive signs in the economy, so the dollar strengthens and
stocks rally as well," said Mikel Keifer, investment strategist at Jurika, Mills & Keifer.
But if the Fed's asset-buying continues to drive down the dollar, helping exporters, trading partners may
become increasingly aggravated and start employing protectionist policies -- a negative for U.S. companies
and their stocks.
In that case, the dollar and stocks could fall together.
"If you go down that path of a weaker dollar, eventually there's a higher policy risk, with all these protectionist
ideas being floated out there," said Jim Dunigan, managing executive of investments at PNC Wealth
Management.
Burt White, Boston-based chief investment officer for LPL Financial, cautioned that, even if the Fed's policies
hurt the dollar, stock investors may find themselves unimpressed by the impact.
Stock investors could ask, "Where's the impact? You've put the gas on the fire, but where's the smoke?" Mr.
White said.
It also is possible that all traces of correlation -- positive or negative -- could simply dissolve after the Fed's
announcement on Wednesday.
"I'm expecting many of these relationships to shift once we see the numbers behind quantitative easing," said
Michael O'Rourke, strategist at BTIG, arguing that the Fed's slow march towards quantitative easing has
distorted the markets.
Mr. O'Rourke said that fundamentals, such as the dollar's continued status as the world's reserve currency,
will eventually support a generally stronger dollar.

There are gold bulls. And then there is Shayne McGuire.
The 44-year-old pension-fund manager from Texas, who spoke recently at a gold conference in Berlin,
caused a stir among the roomful of gold aficionados. His provocation: A book that predicts the price of the
precious metal could soar to $10,000 an ounce, more than seven times its current price.
Like those who once boldly predicted $1,000 Internet stocks and a 36000 Dow Jones Industrial Average, Mr.
McGuire is a lone voice among mainstream investors suggesting such an outsize price jump in gold's price.
Mr. McGuire's view isn't idle prognostication. He runs a $330 million gold portfolio at the Teacher Retirement
System of Texas. Mr. McGuire's forecast, which he made in the recently released book, "Hard Money,"
makes him a very far outlier. Most on Wall Street consider the prediction outlandish.
"If you missed" gold's recent run-up "you have to come up with some pretty sophisticated reasons to buy"
now, says Andy Smith, metals analyst with Bache Commodities, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc.
Mr. McGuire was early to the gold trade. In 2007, he and a colleague persuaded the $100 billion Texas fund,
the nation's eighth largest, to move into the metal. It was a novel strategy that made it one of the few large
U.S. pension funds to have a fund solely devoted to gold.
At the time, gold was trading at around $650, less than half its current price.
In his 2007 pitch, Mr. McGuire argued that gold was "the most underowned major asset, widely seen as an
eccentric, anachronistic leftover from the pre-information age that is best for 'end of world' types."
Not everyone at the Texas fund felt the same way. In one meeting, a pension executive sarcastically asked if
anyone else in the room thought "the world was going to end?"
Indeed, most pension funds still steer clear of gold, investing just a fraction of 1% on average of their assets
in the yellow metal, according to Alan Kosan, of Rogerscasey, an investment-consulting firm. Most pension
funds consider gold too volatile and therefore too risky.
So far, however, Mr. McGuire is in the money. With gold prices surging this year, his fund is up about 25%
since its inception a year ago. For its fiscal year ended in June, the Texas pension fund was up 15.6%
overall. The gold fund has half its assets invested in a gold exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, and
the rest invested in gold stocks.
Gold's historic run-up was spurred by uncertainty about currencies, fears of inflation and continued
monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. Like dot-com stocks in that bubble, which were difficult to value
because many companies generated no earnings, gold is hard to value because it produces no earnings or
revenue and costs money to store.
"It doesn't do anything but cost you charges and stare at you," billionaire investor Warren Buffett said in a
recent interview.
There are other gold bulls, of course, including prominent hedge-fund manager John Paulson, who has
predicted gold could go to $4,000 an ounce by as early as 2013.
For his part, Mr. McGuire says gold is no longer only for those who think financial Armageddon is near. He
expects gold to soar amid rising inflation, among other things. "The world does not need to end for gold to
go hyperbolic," he says.

--- Page 135 ---
Page 135 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
In his book, Mr. McGuire reasons that $10,000 gold is possible if enough other pension funds and big
investors jump-start buying and move as little as 1% of total global stocks and bonds holdings into the metal.
Such a migration into gold would equal enough demand to push prices up tenfold from their current level, he
calculates.
Of course, the same argument would be true for nearly every other investment class. Mr. McGuire has
confidence in his argument, however, because he believes inflation will return, which typically pushes gold
prices higher.
He said he expects a series of fiscal crises to hit around the world. And then there is China, where he says
that gold is "widely regarded as a basic savings asset."
Gold prices also are rising because of the ascendancy of exchange-traded funds, which are funds that track
an index but are be traded like a stock. The largest ETF, under the trading symbol GLD, now invests $50
billion, an amount that Mr. McGuire believes could grow far higher if investors shift a small percentage of their
investment funds into gold. At its current level, the stock-market capitalization of all gold ETFs is about $80
billion, roughly that of McDonald's Corp.
"Now that the value of modern money is becoming highly questionable, more and more people are turning to
gold. It's not the new thing; it's a return to normal," he says.
The son of a foreign correspondent for Newsweek, Mr. McGuire grew up in Mexico and spends leisure time
playing chess and reading history books.
He is a fan of the financial history of the 1930s, and quotes from Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural
speech in 1933 about the importance of not overspending. Before joining the Texas pension fund in 2001, he
was an analyst at Deutsche Bank and ING Barings.
His gold prediction is by far the most aggressive call he has made in his career, he says, but he says he
ignores his doubters. "It seems like an aggressive call," Mr. McGuire says, "but it's really a comment on what
governments have been doing to the monetary system."
Of course, the risks of such a big prediction can affect one's entire career, much as it did former stock analyst
Henry Blodget, whose bullish call on Amazon.com was lambasted after shares plunged in the dot-com bust.
"There are enough nutty-sounding gold targets out there that this one probably won't shock anyone," Mr.
Blodget wrote in an email. "But it's certainly a nice big headline-friendly number."

Uncertainty on Fed Reignites Gold --- Investors Seek Safety Over Fear Easing Plans Eventually Could Boost Inflation

Uncertainty on Fed Reignites Gold --- Investors Seek Safety Over Fear Easing Plans Eventually Could
Boost Inflation

NEW YORK -- Gold prices bounced to the highest point in a week as expectations for monetary easing by
the Federal Reserve collided with stronger economic data.
Investors often turn to the yellow metal to protect themselves against the prospect of inflation. Though
broad-based price increases aren't anticipated in the near future, there are worries that any purchases of
Treasurys debt by the Federal Reserve could spark inflation years from now if what is called quantitative
easing coincides with an uptick in the economic recovery.
That dynamic sent the price of the gold futures contract for November delivery up $19.90, or 1.5%, to
$1,342.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
It is the highest level in six trading sessions and the largest one-day advance in both price and percentage
terms since Oct. 13. The most-actively traded December contract also rose 1.5%.
Gold prices had fallen 4% since hitting a record close of $1,376.70 an ounce on Oct. 14.
The metal accompanied other asset classes, such as stocks and industrial commodities, higher when it
became apparent that the Fed was likely to embark on another round of quantitative easing, essentially
printing money, in a bid to reignite the U.S. economic recovery.
Selling after the record run accelerated after The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the second
round of quantitative easing would happen at a moderate pace. Investors were expecting a forceful move
similar to one taken in the wake of the financial crisis.
Nonetheless, market participants still worry that the program eventually will spark higher inflation.
"Inherently, there's a long-term inflation premium that's starting to build into gold and that will help support
the market going forward," said Bill O'Neil, a principal with Logic Advisors.
That has many concerned that core producer and consumer prices, which don't take some commodity prices
into account, will rise in the next several years. So far, core inflation has remained muted.
Another driver for gold is how the dollar responds to more monetary easing over the longer term. The ICE
Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a trade-weighted basket of others, fell to 77.294 from
78.103 on Wednesday.
Investors streamed away from the dollar in search of riskier investments following strong economic data.
U.S. weekly jobless claims reported on Thursday fell unexpectedly and a gauge of overall economic
sentiment in the bloc of nations that use the euro rose to a 34-month high.
"Certainly the weakness in the dollar is buoying metals today," said Dave Meger, director of metals trading at
Vision Financial Markets. "We still expect continued liquidity to be added and the currency hedge and the
safe haven aspect are going to continue to play out."
Many are betting that monetary easing will lead to a sharp devaluation of the dollar and so they are
gravitating toward gold as a haven that will retain value. Also, when the dollar falls, dollar-denominated gold
becomes less expensive for the plethora of buyers abroad.
Investors in gold haven't just been buying futures. In the third quarter, they bought 28.3 metric tons of gold
via physically backed exchange-traded funds. That brings total holdings to a fresh record of 2,070.1 metric

--- Page 137 ---

tons, valued at $87 billion at the quarter-end spot gold price of $1,307, according to a Thursday report from
the World Gold Council, a mining marketing group. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
Other precious metals traded in New York also rose. Comex December silver rose 47.10 cents, or 2%, to
$23.8710 a troy ounce. Nymex January platinum rose 0.8%, and December palladium tacked on 1.7%.
In other commodity markets:
SUGAR: Price rose to a fresh eight-month high on continued concerns about output in Brazil and Thailand.
Drought throughout Brazil, the world's biggest producer of raw sugar, has cut into its sugar crop, and there
have been slowdowns at ports trying to ship out existing supplies. Meanwhile, flooding in Thailand has
traders weighing possible damage to sugar-growing regions there. World sugar for March delivery rose 0.12
cent, or 0.4%, to 28.71 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.

Cotton Posts Worst Fall in 15 Years --- Report That Texas Storms Did Little Damage Halts Record Run for Prices

Cotton Posts Worst Fall in 15 Years --- Report That Texas Storms Did Little Damage Halts Record Run

Cotton prices posted the biggest drop in 15 years after Texas crop watchers reported that this year's harvest
emerged relatively unscathed from a recent hailstorm.
The price of the cotton futures contract for December delivery fell six cents, or 4.6%, to $1.2359 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. It was the biggest decline in outright terms since 1995 and the biggest in percentage terms
since August 2009.
The fiber, a big part of clothing prices, had set record closes in five consecutive sessions through Tuesday.
While cotton prices in nominal terms had been at a post-Reconstruction Era peak, they remain well below the
inflation-adjusted high of $5.26 a pound set in 1918.
"The market is hypersensitive right now to any news that might impact supply," said Luis Rangel, vice
president of commodities derivatives at ICAP Futures. "When the bull stories don't pan out, you're going to
see some violent moves on the downside."
Thunderstorms moved through West Texas last week, dumping hail and heavy rain on the region's cotton
fields. Prices jumped on worries the storm would damage crops and significantly cut into output. But early
analyst estimates compiled by industry newsletter Cotlook put the losses at 50,000 to 150,000 bales. By
comparison, the U.S. Department of Agriculture expects Texas to produce 8.9 million total bales of cotton.
The U.S. is the world's biggest exporter of cotton, and Texas accounts for a bulk of output.
Analysts are wary of calling the end of the bull run in cotton futures, which have nearly doubled since July.
Textile mills in China continue to make purchases at a feverish pace and measures taken by the world's
biggest cotton consumer are adding to the volatility.
China's National Development and Reform Commission, a regulator, said it will release an additional 400,000
metric tons of cotton from national reserves to satisfy domestic textile demand and stabilize prices. China's
government auctioned off a total of 672,000 tons in the first nine months of this year.
In addition, China's largest agricultural commodities exchange, the Zhengzhou exchange, this week issued
new rules aimed at targeting irregular trading activities. Chinese industry groups have blamed speculative
investors for the run-up in prices.
That isn't the case, according to the latest trader data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Commercial traders -- those engaged in the production or consumption of physical cotton -- added more than
1,400 net long positions in the week ended Oct. 19. It is a clear sign that the actual need for cotton, rather
than hedge funds playing the market, is fueling the jump in prices.
"Commercial longs usually liquidate in a rising market," Mr. Rangel said. "That has not been the case so far,
and that keeps me from saying we're close to a top."
The USDA estimates global stockpiles of cotton will end the 2010-2011 marketing year at a 15-year low of
44.66 million bales, each weighing 480 pounds.
Manufacturers reduced inventories during the global recession and an expected rebound in supplies to match
robust demand was thwarted by heavy rains in China, which also is the world's No. 1 consumer, and the
deadly floods in Pakistan.
A definitive decision on exports from India, the world's second-largest cotton grower, could throw the rally off
track. India last month limited exports to give domestic mills time to stock up. Orders for the 5.5 million bales
not subject to an export duty were filled in just 10 days. It is unclear if more will be released to world markets.

In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices fell as a stronger dollar and a five-million-barrel increase in U.S. oil inventories weighed
on prices, though an unexpected drop in gasoline inventories in weekly government data prevented further
losses. December crude shed 61 cents, or 0.7%, to $81.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
GOLD: Prices fell as inflation fears eased on reduced expectations for the size of the Federal Reserve's
upcoming monetary stimulus. The revised outlook reversed the steady flow of investor money out of the dollar
and into gold in recent weeks. Front-month October gold fell $15.80, or 1.2%, to $1322.20 a troy ounce on
the Comex division of Nymex.

Doubts Surround Rally's Vigor --- Amount of Fed Bond-Buying Program Appears to Disappoint as Dow Slips 43.18
Wednesday's Markets
Doubts Surround Rally's Vigor --- Amount of Fed Bond-Buying Program Appears to Disappoint as
Dow Slips 43.18

For financial markets, the thrill of fresh Federal Reserve action is apparently gone -- for now, anyway.
Stock prices swung wildly Wednesday before the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 43.18 points, or
0.4%, to 11126.28. Treasury prices fell, and the dollar rallied, as investors reversed bets they had placed in
anticipation of another round of bond buying from the Fed.
Some investors appeared disappointed by a report in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that said the
Fed was likely to spend a few hundred billion dollars on its initial purchases, a lower number than some had
hoped and much less than the $2 trillion advocated by some economists. Many also believe that the markets
already had squeezed out most of the juice from any planned easing, before it had even happened.
Fed policy makers are likely to formally announce the bond-purchasing plan, designed to keep interest rates
low and support the economy, after a two-day meeting next week.
For the two months leading up to the meeting, investors had behaved like kids under a swaying pinata,
waiting for a cascade of fresh cash from the Fed.
The Dow surged nearly 12%. Copper, gold and oil soared 17%, 8% and 13%, respectively. Treasury-bond
yields, which fall as prices rise, at one point dropped to less than 2.4%, their lowest levels since January
2009. And the dollar tumbled almost 8% against a basket of major currencies.
Many observers thought markets had set themselves up for disappointment and were readying themselves
for some kind of fall. That selloff appeared to have been jump-started Wednesday.
"We had fully expected that, next week, we were going to see a little air taken out of the market," said Hank
Smith, chief investment officer of equities at Haverford Investments. "Maybe what we had expected . . . is
starting to happen right now."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.19 points, or 0.3%, to 1182.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index,
after spending most of the day in the red, ended 5.97 points higher, or 0.2%, at 2503.26.
At one point in the day, the Dow was down nearly 150 points before rallying to a softer loss.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for mortgage rates and other borrowing costs
throughout the economy, jumped to 2.71%, the highest in more than a month.
Commodity prices also lost ground. Gold fell more than 1% to $1322.20 a troy ounce in Comex trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Nymex crude oil fell 61 cents, or 0.7%, to $81.94 a barrel.
The dollar, which could be a loser once the Fed opens its cash spigots, rose nearly to its highest level against
other major currencies since the month began.
Bond and currency markets, which often move ahead of the stock market, had already started to price in
some Fed disappointment. The 10-year-note yield has been rising for more than two weeks from its bottom,
and the dollar has been rising with it in lock step.
But the stock market had continued to churn higher until Wednesday.
For a time, "it looked like we were on this path where the sky was the limit" on easing, said Doug Cliggott,
U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse in Boston, who estimates that about two-thirds of the run-up in stocks

--- Page 141 ---
Page 141 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
could be attributed to Fed expectations, with the remainder coming from expectations of congressional
gridlock, corporate earnings and a recent run of improving economic data.
After the tempering of expectations, Mr. Cliggott said, next week could see investors' expectations continue to
fluctuate.
"I can see the dial moving a bit between now and then in terms in expectations," he said. Ultimately, however,
if the Fed disappoints, Mr. Cliggott said "a big chunk" of the autumn rally may evaporate.
The main question is how long the disappointment continues. If investors doubt that the Fed's purchases will
be large enough to help to the economy, they may continue to sell.
On the other hand, most investors recall how the Fed was able to goose financial markets higher last year
with its first round of quantitative easing.
"In the longer term, continuing purchases and weak economic growth over the winter are likely to boost
Treasurys and risk assets and keep the U.S. dollar on the back foot," David Semmens, U.S. economist at
Standard Chartered, told clients.
This is just the latest episode in the sometimes stormy relationship that has persisted between the Fed and
markets for much of the past two years.
Markets have repeatedly cheered Fed actions to bolster the economy, but have become somewhat
dependent on them.
The Fed may not want to be boxed into a corner by market expectations, but also likely can't be too pleased
with stock and bond markets selling off, either. A major point of quantitative easing is to boost asset prices,
making financial conditions easier for the economy.
"Note to Fed -- namby-pamby won't allow you to realize your goals," David Ader, head of government bond
strategy at CRT Capital, wrote in a note, suggesting next week's Fed announcement might be more
aggressive in response to the recent rise in interest rates.

Gold vs. the Fed: The Record Is Clear

When it meets next week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to signal its
desire to increase the rate of inflation by providing additional monetary stimulus. This policy is based on a
false -- and dangerous -- premise: that manipulating the dollar's buying power will lead to higher employment
and economic growth. But the experience of the past 40 years points to the opposite conclusion: that
guaranteeing a stable value for the dollar by restoring dollar-gold convertibility would be the surest way for
the Federal Reserve to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.
From 1947 through 1967, the year before the U.S. began to weasel out of its commitment to dollar-gold
convertibility, unemployment averaged only 4.7% and never rose above 7%. Real growth averaged 4% a
year. Low unemployment and high growth coincided with low inflation. During the 21 years ending in 1967,
consumer-price inflation averaged just 1.9% a year. Interest rates, too, were low and stable -- the yield on
triple-A corporate bonds averaged less than 4% and never rose above 6%.
What's happened since 1971, when President Nixon formally broke the link between the dollar and gold?
Higher average unemployment, slower growth, greater instability and a decline in the economy's resilience.
For the period 1971 through 2009, unemployment averaged 6.2%, a full 1.5 percentage points above the
1947-67 average, and real growth rates averaged less than 3%. We have since experienced the three worst
recessions since the end of World War II, with the unemployment rate averaging 8.5% in 1975, 9.7% in 1982,
and above 9.5% for the past 14 months. During these 39 years in which the Fed was free to manipulate the
value of the dollar, the consumer-price index rose, on average, 4.4% a year. That means that a dollar today
buys only about one-sixth of the consumer goods it purchased in 1971.
Interest rates, too, have been high and highly volatile, with the yield on triple-A corporate bonds averaging
more than 8% and, until 2003, never falling below 6%. High and highly volatile interest rates are
symptomatic of the monetary uncertainty that has reduced the economy's ability to recover from external
shocks and led directly to one financial crisis after another. During these four decades of discretionary
monetary policies, the world suffered no fewer than 10 major financial crises, beginning with the oil crisis of
1973 and culminating in the financial crisis of 2008-09, and now the sovereign debt crisis and potential
currency war of 2010. There were no world-wide financial crises of similar magnitude between 1947 and
1971.
At the center of each of these crises were gyrating currency values -- either on foreign-exchange markets or
in terms of real goods and services. As the dollar's value gyrates it produces windfall profits and losses,
feeding speculation and poor judgment. The housing bubble was fed in part by 40 years of experience with a
dollar that lost purchasing power every year. Today, individual investors are piling into gold and other
commodities in hopes of finding a safe haven from the FOMC's intention to decrease the buying power of the
dollar and reduce the value of our savings.
And what of the seductive promise that a floating dollar would make American labor more competitive and
improve the nation's trade balance? In 1967, one dollar could buy the equivalent of approximately 2.4 euros
(based on the pre-euro German mark) and 362 yen. Over the succeeding 42 years, the dollar has been
devalued by 72% against the euro and 75% against the yen. Yet net exports have fallen from a modest
surplus in 1967 to a $390 billion deficit equivalent to 2.7% of GDP today.
The members of the FOMC, like their predecessors, are trying to do the best they can, but they are not really
sure what it is that needs to be done. They have kept the federal-funds rate near zero for almost two years,
but small businesses find it difficult to get loans and savers suffer from the lost income brought by artificially
low interest rates. Now they're about to advocate higher inflation -- i.e., less price stability -- in hopes of
spurring economic growth.
Economists and pundits may disagree on why the gold standard delivered such superior results compared to
the recurrent crises, instability and overall inferior economic performance delivered by the current system. But

--- Page 143 ---

the data are clear: A gold-based system delivers higher employment and more price stability. The time has
come to begin the serious work of building a 21st-century gold standard for the benefit of American workers,
investors and businesses.

Tips That Aren't TIPS --- Inflation Hedges: Commodities, Currencies, Dividend Stocks

Tips That Aren't TIPS --- Inflation Hedges: Commodities, Currencies, Dividend Stocks

The Federal Reserve next week is expected to announce another round of asset buying to juice the economy
and prevent deflation. Investors on Monday showed confidence that the Fed will succeed: For the first time
ever, an inflation-protected Treasury note was auctioned with a negative yield -- meaning it will have a
positive return only if consumer prices rise more than half a percentage point.
But investors might want to consider other options for inflation protection.
That is because Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, tend to have a low "correlation" to the
consumer-price index, the main inflation gauge. The correlation between the two from 2002 to 2009, was
just 0.21%. A correlation of 1 means two assets move in perfect lock step, a correlation of minus-1 means
they move in opposite directions, and a figure of zero means they are uncorrelated.
What's more, if inflation kicks in too quickly, Ben Bernanke's Fed might raise interest rates suddenly. If that
were to happen, bond investors would likely do badly, because bond prices fall as interest rates rise. In that
scenario, TIPS might beat regular Treasurys, but not much else.
A better way to play rising inflation, say investment strategists, is commodities, whose correlation to the CPI
was a beefier 0.63 from 2002 to 2009.
However, not all commodities are equally attractive right now. David Darst, chief investment strategist for
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, advises investors to be wary of precious metals that have run up recently.
Gold is up 22.1% year to date, while silver has soared 40.1%.
Other commodities, which have gained less, may be better bets, he says. Oil has gained only 3.3% this year,
while a basket of base metals has risen just 3.8%. Both performed well when inflation raged during the
1970s.
"In inflationary times, you should look for real assets -- but you have to pick your spots," Mr. Darst says.
Another way to play rising inflation is foreign currencies. That is because, if investors believe inflation is
devaluing the dollar, they will dump it in favor of currencies from nations whose central banks are acting to
keep inflation under control. That includes nations like Australia, South Korea, Singapore and Sweden, all of
which have raised interest rates to combat inflation, says Brian Nick, an investment strategist at Barclays
Wealth.
Investors can gain exposure to developed-market currencies with the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index
Bearish Fund and to emerging-market currencies with the WisdomTree Dreyfus Emerging Currency fund.
Another big winner during the 1970s: dividend-paying stocks. The shares of large companies, which are more
likely to pay dividends than smaller companies, gained 38% from 1975 through 1980, when inflation rose as
high as 14.4%. For the decade, dividends accounted for 75% of the stock market's total return.
Such companies also tend to have the ability to pass inflation onto consumers in the form of higher prices,
and have substantial operations abroad. A weaker dollar would make their products cheaper overseas.
Dividend payers are "like buying a bond, but the coupon is growing," says Sam Katzman, chief financial
officer at Constellation Wealth Advisors.

Silver-Market Probe: Act Now, CFTC Is Urged
Silver-Market Probe: Act Now, CFTC Is Urged

A Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulator is putting pressure on the agency to take action in a
high-profile, two-year-old investigation of the silver market.
At a CFTC hearing Tuesday to consider new rules to strengthen its commodity-enforcement powers,
commissioner Bart Chilton said market players have made "repeated" and "fraudulent efforts to persuade and
deviously control" silver prices. Mr. Chilton said he believed there have been violations of CFTC rules that
should be prosecuted, though he couldn't publicly disclose trader names.
CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler declined to comment on the silver investigation or Mr. Chilton's comments.
The call to action on the silver investigation comes as the CFTC faces increasing pressure because of its
expanded role overseeing derivatives trading under the new financial-overhaul law. For years, lawmakers
have criticized the agency for failing to aggressively police the commodities markets.
In its 36-year history, the CFTC has reached settlements in more than three dozen manipulation-related
cases, though it has successfully concluded just one manipulation case from trial through appeal. To win
manipulation cases in the past, the CFTC had to prove that a trader intended to manipulate prices. Under the
financial overhaul's new fraud-based manipulation powers, the CFTC's burden of proof would be lower.
The CFTC's investigation of silver has heated up in recent weeks. The agency's enforcement staff has
circulated a packet of information to CFTC lawyers and commissioners, outlining some of its findings in the
silver probe, including documents that could suggest there have been attempts to manipulate prices. In
recent days, the commissioners have been discussing how to proceed in the investigation, but they haven't
made a decision.
The investigation comes as more individual investors enter the red-hot area of commodities trading, rushing
to buy exchange-traded funds. The broad ETF market has ballooned to more than $900 billion in recent
years, including iShares Silver Trust, a silver ETF with a market value of $7.8 billion.
Meanwhile, the price of silver, gold and other precious metals are soaring. On Tuesday, silver traded at
$23.824 an ounce, up 1.2%.
The silver market is no stranger to controversy. Theories that the price of silver is being manipulated have
long been held by a vocal segment of traders. Many big banks, traders and longtime players in the silver
market dismiss that notion.
The silver market was at the center of one of the most high-profile cases in the commodities world. In 1985,
the CFTC accused the Hunt brothers of Texas and others with illegally manipulating silver prices in 1979 and
1980. Large purchases of silver by the Hunts "artificially" drove up prices, the CFTC said, leading to a plunge.
The Hunts at the time denied wrongdoing. In 1989, Nelson Bunker Hunt agreed to pay penalties of up to $10
million and consented to a ban from commodities trading. William Hunt, who now works for an
energy-exploration company owned by the Hunt family, said: "We didn't manipulate the market or corner the
market" and added that he no longer is involved in the silver market.
The continuing CFTC investigation of the silver market began two years ago, after Mr. Chilton and others at
the CFTC were besieged with emails from hundreds of investors, who complained that they believed silver
prices were being manipulated. A number of the emails allege that the CFTC is dragging its feet and ignoring
evidence of manipulation in the silver market.
It isn't the first time in recent years that the CFTC has examined similar allegations in the silver market. The
agency's market-oversight division conducted a 2008 study and found no evidence of manipulation.

Page 146 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
After complaints continued, the agency's enforcement division made an unusual announcement in September
2008 that it had launched an investigation into the matter.
Over the past two years, silver prices have bounced around, rising to around $20 just before the May 2008
CFTC report, then dropping to around $9. In 2009, silver prices climbed back to just under $20. This year,
silver prices have soared 41.6% amid a lower U.S. dollar and rising concerns over inflation, at one point
hitting their highest level in 30 years.
Despite silver's lofty price, some analysts and others suspecting manipulation believe the metal should be
trading at far higher levels.
Earlier this year, the investigation took a new twist when the CFTC began looking into allegations by a trader
in London who contended that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., one of the largest silver traders, was involved in
manipulative silver trading, a person close to the situation says.
In recent months, CFTC lawyers have interviewed employees of J.P. Morgan in its metals-trading business
as well as industry traders, commodity executives, experts and employees of other metals-trading firms, a
person familiar with the situation says.
J.P. Morgan and HSBC Holdings PLC traditionally have been big players in the silver market. A CFTC weekly
report for Oct. 19, the most recent period, shows that less than four market players hold 24.3% of all net
bearish bets in the silver market. J.P. Morgan and HSBC are among those market participants, according to
silver traders and a person close to the investigation. In recent months, however, the banks with large futures
positions have sharply reduced the size of their holdings.
Both J.P. Morgan and HSBC declined to comment on any aspect of the investigation.

Yields on TIPS Go Negative --- Big Demand for Bonds Suggests Fed Is Winning Deflation Battle; It 'Is Striking'
Credit Markets
Yields on TIPS Go Negative --- Big Demand for Bonds Suggests Fed Is Winning Deflation Battle; It 'Is
Striking'

A combination of low interest rates and growing fears of rising prices enabled the U.S. government to sell
inflation-protected Treasury bonds with a negative yield for the first time ever on Monday.
That means if inflation doesn't appear as investors expect, they could end up paying to lend money to the
government.
The Treasury sold $10 billion of five-year Treasury inflation protected securities, or TIPS, at an auction on
Monday with a yield of negative 0.55%.
The big demand is a sign the Federal Reserve is gaining some traction in its efforts to kickstart the economy
and nudge inflation higher. TIPS are designed to protect investors against inflation, offering a return that
rises as the cost of goods increase. In times of inflation, they are more attractive than standard Treasury
bonds, whose fixed income stream is worth less as other prices are rising.
"While the yield on many TIPS is negative, investors in these securities expect a positive return overall," Tony
Crescenzi, portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif.
Financial-market investors, economists and even Federal Reserve officials have been engaged in a
months-long debate over whether inflation or deflation is the bigger threat to the economy. In some ways,
Monday's auction is a sign that some investors are tilting in favor of inflation. There are other signs, too.
Gold, a traditional hedge against inflation, is trading near record highs and the U.S. dollar has been falling.
TIPS investors won't lose money as long as the economy avoids deflation for the next five years, as TIPS
investors get extra money every year to keep up with the inflation rate. If inflation is high enough to offset
the negative yield, investors will end up with a positive return.
Yields on Treasurys have turned negative before, particularly at the depth of the financial crisis. Then,
investors in short-term Treasurys did pay a small amount of money to lend to the government, but were
willing to do so because they were able to protect most of their investment from market turmoil.
Today's extraordinarily low yields are a result of Fed efforts to fend off deflation by buying up Treasurys and
TIPS to push their yields to rock-bottom levels. Investors expect the Fed to announce another round of
Treasury purchases after its policy meeting on Nov. 3. Investors have been buying both TIPS and Treasurys
in anticipation, but lately TIPS have outperformed.
If negative TIPS yields reflect anxiety about inflation, then that suggests the Fed may be succeeding.
Deflation is partly a result of consumers delaying purchases because they think prices are going to fall.
The negative yield on five-year TIPS owes partly to the fact that nominal five-year Treasurys yield just 1.18%,
which is barely higher than consumer price inflation for the past year.
The difference between regular Treasury yields and TIPS yields, often called the "breakeven inflation rate,"
is a rough measure of the market's inflation expectations for the future. That breakeven inflation rate has
grown since the Fed made it clear it was going to restart its bond buying, an effort known as quantitative
easing.
In the case of five-year TIPS, the negative yield suggests inflation expectations of about 1.70% -- hardly
runaway inflation, but better than deflation.

Bond Market TIPS Toward Inflation
Abreast of the Market
Bond Market TIPS Toward Inflation

For all the debate this year over whether deflation or inflation is the bigger threat to the economy, in the bond
market, at least, the argument has been a wash.
Inflation insurance in the form of TIPS, or Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, has returned about 10%
this year, according to Barclays Capital indexes. At the same time, regular Treasurys, which thrive in times of
deflation, are up nearly 9%. The performance is measured by combining price appreciation with yield
payment.
In other words, you have been a winner this year whether you were betting on inflation or deflation.
One question is whether Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is about to bring this kumbaya moment to
an end.
With the Fed preparing to pump more money into the financial system, the scales are starting to tip in favor of
those betting on inflation. TIPS have outperformed Treasurys in the past two weeks, after lagging behind
them for most of the summer.
The gap between yields on Treasurys and TIPS has widened sharply. This gap, often called the "breakeven"
inflation rate, is used as a rough measure of market expectations of inflation.
Since late August -- just before Mr. Bernanke's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., suggesting the Fed could
embark on another round of quantitative easing to juice the economy -- the 10-year breakeven rate has
surged from 1.49% to roughly 2.10%, the highest in five months.
That suggests the Fed has already raised inflation expectations, simply by talking about the second round of
quantitative easing, known in the market as QE2. The recent rally for gold and misery for the dollar also
suggest inflation expectations are rising.
"We're not at a point where the market is getting particularly concerned about high inflation, it's just less
concerned about deflation or even low inflation for a long period of time," said Mike Pond, Treasury and
inflation-linked strategist at Barclays.
TIPS and Treasurys had benefited from hopes of another round of quantitative easing, which is expected to
be announced at the Fed's policy meeting on Nov. 3.
Ten-year Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, fell this month to their lowest levels
since the dark days of January 2009.
TIPS are at similarly historical levels: The Treasury Department is scheduled to sell $10 billion in new
five-year TIPS on Monday, and the yield is likely to be the lowest since the government started selling them in
1997.
A low yield means demand is high for TIPS, which offer investors additional annual returns to make up for the
rate of inflation. Regular Treasury bonds don't offer that protection, so they have higher yields to
compensate. The gap, or break-even, between the two yields implies what investors expect inflation to be.
On the surface, it looks like investors are making two bets at once, one on prices rising and the other on
prices falling. But the Fed's influence is a driving and distorting force in both markets. The Fed's initial easing
program involved buying supersafe assets such as Treasurys and TIPS at the same time private demand
was high for just such safe havens. The combination of higher demand and shrinking supply resulted in
artificially high prices and low yields for Treasurys and TIPS.

--- Page 150 ---
Page 150 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The central bank is likely to buy Treasurys and TIPS again as part of any QE2 program, encouraging
investors to buy both assets. There is also a risk that the Fed's program could go too far and spark runaway
inflation, another reason for investors to buy TIPS.
"The most salient comment in the latest Fed policy statement was that inflation was too low and they were
going to do something about it," said Wil Stith, portfolio manager with MTB Investment Advisors in Baltimore,
which has about $13 billion under management. "That says to me that TIPS are too cheap."
Mr. Stith has been buying TIPS lately, increasing the weighting in the MTB Intermediate-Term Bond Fund he
manages to between 5% and 10%.
Larger investors such as Allianz SE unit Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, have also bought
TIPS in recent months.
TIPS aren't pure barometers of inflation expectations. They are affected by a dearth of supply, which can
affect yields. Also affecting TIPS is something called the inflation-risk premium. This is a bet on the volatility
of future inflation, rather than a bet on inflation itself, and it has risen lately.
This bet on higher inflation volatility could indicate traders are worried the Fed could make a policy mistake
along the way. An unexpectedly aggressive Fed on Nov. 3 could push TIPS yields even lower. Still, an
unexpectedly cautious Fed could cause TIPS prices to fall, hurting investors who have recently piled in. TIPS
may at least be due for a correction, which could come well ahead of the Fed's expected announcement of
QE2 in early November.
"Once QE2 is fully priced into the market, then that might be the moment when real yields rise again," said
Joseph Shatz, interest-rate strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. If that time hasn't already come, it is
very close, he said. "TIPS real yields are at historically low levels across the curve, and we do not believe this
is sustainable in the long run," Mr. Shatz said.

Advisers Try to Tame The Appetite for Gold

Advisers Try to Tame The Appetite for Gold

As individual investors hop on the gold bandwagon, financial advisers are finding themselves in an
all-too-familiar role: that of mom and dad slapping hands away from the cookie jar.
The precious metal has enjoyed a long run-up, gaining about 25% in the past year and consistently making
headlines with records pushing ever higher. Also fueling the buying binge is a number of big-name investors
like Paulson & Co.'s John Paulson. Gold prices stood at $1,324.40 a troy ounce Friday.
Such price spikes and high-profile bullishness often create a ticklish situation for advisers: They think about
selling just as clients want to buy.
"I am not a gold bug, but I have a couple of clients that have just insisted," said Jim Heitman, a financial
planner in Alta Loma, Calif. "Even as they objectively recognize the threat of a bubble, they just don't seem to
care."
Mr. Heitman says he sometimes uses commodity-sensitive stock funds such as PowerShares Dynamic Basic
Materials Sector ETF but doesn't like making direct bets on a single commodity like gold.
To clients who walk in the door craving gold, he makes two arguments. For one, long-term gold prices
merely keep pace with inflation, and investors should concentrate instead on their broader goals like what
kind of income they would like to generate. For those that won't be swayed, he points to SPDR Gold Trust,
but keeps the exchange-traded fund at no more than 5% of overall portfolios.
Trying to talk clients out of hot investments is nothing new. In some ways, advisers say, the gold boom is
easier to deal with than past spikes like the Internet-stock bubble in the late 1990s. That proved to be the cap
on a 20-year bull market that had many investors feeling invincible.
George Middleton, a financial adviser in Vancouver, Wash., says the current fascination with gold began in
2009, spurred in part by desire for a safe harbor.
As the price of gold has climbed steadily, investors have remained interested, if not always for the same
reasons. While many of his clients own iShares Gold Trust, he has been selling small lots to keep the metal
from becoming too big a part of their portfolios.
Clients "check to make sure they own it; then they ask should I buy more?" Mr. Middleton said. "The answer
is usually 'No.' "

Why Easier Money Won't Work
Why Easier Money Won't Work
By Joseph Stiglitz

The Federal Reserve, having done so much to create the problems in which the economy is now mired,
having mistakenly thought that even after the housing bubble burst the problems were contained, and having
underestimated the severity of the problem, now wants to make a contribution to preventing the economy
from sinking into a Japanese-style malaise. How? As Chairman Ben Bernanke announced last week, through
large-scale purchases of U.S. Treasurys -- called quantitative easing, or QE.
The Fed is right to be worried.
If high unemployment continues, America faces the risk of losing human capital as the skills of the
unemployed erode. It will then become increasingly difficult to bring the unemployment rate down to
anywhere near the levels that prevailed in the mid- and late 1990s, and the higher unemployment rate and
lower output will make the current pessimistic budget projections of the Congressional Budget Office and the
Office of Management and Budget look rosy.
The problem is that, with interest rates already near zero, there is little the Fed can do to restart the
economy -- and doing the wrong thing can do considerable damage. In 2001, (then) record-low interest rates
didn't reignite investment in plant and equipment. They did, however, replace the tech bubble with an even
more dangerous housing bubble. We are now dealing with the legacy of that bubble, with excess capacity in
real estate and excess leverage in households.
Today, the Fed is paying too little attention to the transmission between the interest rates paid by
government and the terms and availability of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Large
businesses are flush with cash, and small changes in interest rates -- short-term or long -- will affect them
little. A banker rightly asks if such a business comes asking for money, "What's wrong with it?"
But it is SMEs that are the source of job creation in most economies, including the U.S. Many of these
enterprises are starved for cash. They can't borrow money at the interest rate that big banks, big firms or
government can. They borrow from banks, and many of the smaller local and community banks on which they
depend are in dire straits -- more than 800 are on the FDIC's watch list.
Yet even if the banks were willing and able to lend, lending to SMEs is typically collateral-based, and the
value of the most common form of collateral, real estate, has fallen 30% to 40%. No wonder then that credit
availability is so constrained. But QE in the form of buying U.S. Treasurys is not likely to affect this much. It
will have some effect in lowering mortgage rates, and lower mortgage rates will put a little more money into
people's pockets. Higher real-estate prices may also allow some SMEs to borrow more. But these effects,
though positive, are likely to be small -- so small as to make a barely perceptible difference in America's
persistent unemployment.
There is another channel through which easing will have some positive effects: Equity prices are likely to rise.
But for all the reasons just given, this is unlikely to have much effect on investment. Nor will most Americans,
burdened with debt and diminished retirement accounts, likely embark on much of a spending spree. Nor
should they. Doing so would only delay the deleveraging that is necessary if we are to have sustainable
growth going forward.
There is another downside risk: QE may not even succeed in lowering interest rates, or lowering them very
much. Given the magnitude of excess capacity, there is little risk of inflation today. But if the inflation hawks
come to believe that the risk of future inflation is real, then they'll believe that short-term interest rates will
rise. This will mean that long-term interest rates, even now, may actually rise, in spite of the massive Fed
intervention, because long-term interest rates are based on expectations of future short-term interest rates.

--- Page 154 ---

QE poses a third risk: The bursting of the bond market bubble that the Fed is seeking to develop -- the sequel
to the tech and housing bubbles -- will clearly have adverse effects on the economy, as we should have
learned by now.
The advocates of QE point to another channel through which it will strengthen the economy: Lower interest
rates may also lead to a weaker dollar, and the weaker dollar to more exports. Competitive devaluation
engineered through low interest rates has become the preferred form of beggar-thy-neighbor policies in the
21st century. But this policy only works if other countries don't respond. They will and have, through every
instrument at their disposal. They too can lower interest rates. They can impose capital controls, taxes and
bank regulations, and they can intervene directly in their exchange rate.
Under the gold standard, there was supposed to be an automatic adjustment mechanism, as a country with a
trade surplus would see an inflow of gold and an increase in prices, leading to an automatic real appreciation
of its currency. It never worked as smoothly as it was supposed to, but in the modern economy with fiat
money, the adjustment processes can be short-circuited even more easily. China, for instance, has sufficient
control of its banking system and economy that it can simultaneously maintain a stable exchange rate that
generates a surplus and prevents inflation.
Such policies may come with a price, but the price may be less than the alternative: the bankruptcies and
unemployment that would follow from disruptive currency appreciation as the U.S. lets forth a flood of
liquidity. That money is supposed to reignite the American economy but instead goes around the world
looking for economies that actually seem to be functioning well and wreaking havoc there.
The upside of QE is limited. The money simply won't go to where it's needed, and the wealth effects are too
small. The downside is a risk of global volatility, a currency war, and a global financial market that is
increasingly fragmented and distorted. If the U.S. wins the battle of competitive devaluation, it may prove to
be a pyrrhic victory, as our gains come at the expense of others -- including those to whom we hope to
export.

Expectations of Federal Reserve Bond Buying Build, Some Investors Are Betting on the U.S. Dollar
and the Long Bond

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke seems poised to deliver a second round of "quantitative easing,"
meaning the Fed will buy assets like Treasury bonds to lower long-term interest rates and boost the
economy. Investors who pile in after the Fed could get hurt.
The central bank is expected to announce at its Nov. 3 meeting that it is launching the second round of
quantitative easing since the financial crisis began.
If it works, the thinking goes, bond yields should fall, the dollar should drop and riskier assets like stocks and
commodities should rise. That is what happened during the first round of quantitative easing, at the height of
the financial crisis. The Fed's bond buying, which was first announced in November 2008, pushed stocks up
29.5% during the next 12 months, while gold gained 44.5% and high-yield bonds rose 16.6%. The dollar
plummeted 12.6%.
But while Mr. Bernanke is widely expected to deliver on his end next month, the markets may not.
The problem is twofold. First, this isn't 2008. Back then the financial system was crumbling, asset prices and
inflation expectations were depressed and Fed had much more wiggle room. The impact of its bond
purchases could be felt more when 10-year Treasury yields were at 3.3% and inflation expectations were
just 0.2% than at today's 2.5% Treasury rate and inflation expectation of 2.1%.
Boosting stock prices, too, was far easier when shares were trading at 666 -- the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index's March 8 intraday low -- than it will be at today's 1180.
The full impact of another round of quantitative easing might have been priced into the market already, says
George Goncalves, head of U.S. rates strategy at Nomura Securities International.
Mr. Goncalves cites the 10-year bond yield, for example, which has stopped falling despite accumulating
evidence that the Fed will act. The yield fell from 2.92% on Aug. 6, when Mr. Bernanke's speech at the
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., persuaded the market
that quantitative easing was on its way, to a low of 2.38% on Oct. 11. Since then yields have risen as high as
2.58%.
Other assets, meanwhile, have rallied. Since the end of August, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has
gained 11.3%, oil has jumped 11.2% and gold has increased 7.6%.
"Investors who come to the table today have missed a big market reaction to the Fed's intentions," says Peter
Boockvar, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York.
Take the U.S. dollar. Currencies of countries with falling interest rates tend to weaken against those of
countries with steady or rising rates. True to form, the dollar has dropped 6.6% against a basket of six
currencies since Mr. Bernanke's Jackson Hole speech.
That decline, however, has been roughly equal to the increase in the money supply caused by the Fed's
bond buying, suggesting the dollar has fallen as much as it should in the near-term, says Keith Hembre, chief
economist at First American Funds in Minneapolis.
Shorting the dollar has been a favorite trade of some market professionals. Bets against the greenback by
hedge funds and other speculative investors have more than doubled from $13.6 billion on Sept. 14 to $29
billion on Oct. 12, near the record of $36.5 billion reached in 2007, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.

--- Page 156 ---
Page 156 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
That leaves the dollar ripe for a short-term rally, says Nomura International currency strategist Jens Nordvig.
He says the dollar index could gain 2% to 3% if the Fed announces an incremental approach to bond
purchases, as investors who have shorted the dollar take profits.
Some contrarians even advise buying 30-year Treasurys. The long bond has weakened in recent weeks:
Yields, which move in the opposite direction of price, have leaped from 3.53% to 3.94% since Aug. 26, the
day before Mr. Bernanke's Jackson Hole speech. That has presented an attractive buying opportunity, says
Richard Cookson, the London-based global chief investment officer at Citi Private Bank, especially if
investors think the Fed's bond buying won't cure what ails the U.S economy.
"Unemployment remains very high, inflation is falling and quantitative easing isn't going to change that," says
Mr. Cookson. Long-term interest rates, therefore, aren't likely to go up, and could even fall from here --
meaning bond prices could rise.
A miniversion of the QE2-unwind scenario played out on Tuesday. After China announced it would boost key
interest rates by a quarter-point, global markets convulsed. Stocks tumbled, commodities plunged and the
dollar jumped. They all reversed course on Wednesday, as the QE2 theme that has driven the markets for
the past two months reasserted itself.
But the trend could be near an end. Nomura's Mr. Nordvig, for one, recommends that investors own the U.S.
dollar now, ahead of the Nov. 3 Fed meeting, in anticipation of a short-term rally.
"Expectations have gone too far," Mr. Nordvig says. "The magnitude of the moves is more than fully pricing
what is reasonable."

State College, Pa. -- As America's economic might surged in the last half of the 19th century, culminating in
the Gilded Age, a growing class of wealthy industrialists wanted fine art to furnish their grand homes. Elegant
portraits, verdant landscapes, and lush still-lifes were popular, and such artists as John Singer Sargent,
James Abbott McNeill Whistler and Thomas Eakins obliged.
But Americans also suffered hardship during those years, weathering at least four financial panics -- in 1857,
1869, 1873 and 1893. Some artists weighed in with works commenting on the recessions and the financial
inequities they produced. "Taxing Visions: Financial Episodes in Late Nineteenth-Century American Art,"
which is on view through Dec. 19 at the Palmer Museum of Art at Penn State University and then travels to
the Huntington Library near Pasadena, Calif, showcases that strain of American art.
Fortunately, the exhibition itself is not depressing, for as the catalog notes, artists knew that their paintings
could not be too "squalid," or they would not sell. Some, then, put a hopeful gloss on their works, while others
injected humor and still others settled for straight reportage.
It is odd, then, that this small exhibition, filling just two of the Palmer's galleries (whose walls have been
colored, none too subtly, green), starts out with the saddest, most disturbing painting: "Tattered and Torn" by
Alfred Kappes. Mr. Kappes frequently focused on African-American communities, and in "Tattered and Torn"
(1886), he portrays an old woman -- said to be a domestic servant -- in ragged dress, her eyes nearly shut,
trying to light what may be her last cigarette with what may well be her last match. Dramatically lit, in bare
surroundings that function as a stage, she personifies a depth of poverty that other works in the show avoid.
A better scene-setter, portraying cause and not effect, is just a few feet away, in "Wall Street, Half Past Two
O'Clock, October 13, 1857" (1858) by James Henry Cafferty and Charles G. Rosenberg. In this great urban
scene, the banking crisis and market crash had begun, and traders, tycoons and people from all over New
York City had rushed into the downtown streets. At the center of the narrative, the artists placed two
newsboys, whose message ripples through the crowd, changing the looks on faces known and unknown
(Cornelius Vanderbilt stands on the far right, for example).
That crisis, and later ones, wreaked their greatest harm on the subjects of many pieces that follow -- working
men, women and children. The paintings themselves often seem sentimental and benign -- with few tatters in
sight -- until you realize that the sad little girl in John George Brown's "Buy A Posy" (1881) has probably been
selling for hours. Her head tilts back, at the same angle as the flowers in her hand, and her eyes implore the
viewer to buy one of the many bouquets she has left. Please.
Similarly, Mr. Cafferty's "The Weary Newsboy" (1861), with many more papers to peddle, leans dejectedly
against a wooden box, knowing he can't go anywhere until he sells them. And the urchin in David Gilmour
Blythe's "A Match Seller" (c. 1859) hungrily devours an apple, a full basket of match boxes at his side. These
street children, dependent on their wits and their work for support, deliver a message that's hard to ignore.
Among the adult sufferers, one standout is Frank Moss's Rockwellian "A Difficult Job" (undated). It depicts a
cobbler pondering how to fix a sole that is broken in two. "Perhaps tellingly," writes Kevin M. Murphy, one of
the show's curators, "his frown repeats the arc of the shoe, as if the former is a result of his unrelenting labor
on the latter." Yet it's the shoe's owner, off-sight, who elicits more sympathy. Also unseen are the seller
offering William Harnett's "Job Lot Cheap" (1878) and those who placed items in Rose Hartwell's "A Corner
Window in a Pawn Shop" (1893), an unfocused, motley arrangement that is one of the weakest works in the
exhibition.
For its size -- about 30 academically informed, narrative paintings and a few etchings, including one of
beggars by Mr. Whistler -- this exhibition covers a lot, indeed too much, ground. The have vs. have-not
dichotomy surfaces in a few works, like Thomas Waterman Wood's "Crossing the Ferry" (1878) where the

upper classes reach into their pockets and purses to give coins to a waif playing a violin; and in "Evading the
Excise Law -- Laying in Rum for Sunday" (1867), an engraving by Stanley Fox that depicts a Saturday night
scene in a New York rum shop (and is the only actual reference to taxes in this preincome-tax era). The male
vs. female experience is shown in Charles Knoll's "Panic of 1869" (1869) depicting a ruined businessman
hiding his face from the news while his wife, a baby at her feet, holds his hand and looks away. Westward
flight is represented by William de la Montaigne Cary's "Pikes Peak's or Bust." And the famed election of
1896, with its debates on monetary policy and the gold standard, is immortalized in Victor Dubreuil's "The
Cross of Gold" (1896) five currency notes nailed to a brown wall. And that's just a sampling; the works whirl
through a dizzying array of topics.
Perhaps that is because the show itself was the victim of the current recession. Originally, it was conceived
as an exhibit of about 70 works, with a catalog -- now about 75 pages -- longer by 200 pages. Shrunken by
the times, it's quirky and uneven, but it does remind viewers of this neglected genre of American art.

Big Win for a Big Bear --- Hedge Fund Bridgewater Profits on Foresight of World Woes
Big Win for a Big Bear --- Hedge Fund Bridgewater Profits on Foresight of World Woes

One of the nation's largest hedge funds is emerging as a big winner of 2010, earning its managers and clients
billions in profits through a series of bearish bets on the U.S. economy.
Bridgewater Associates Inc. has scored a return of about 38% at its flagship fund, driven in part by a
multifaceted wager that the U.S. economy would be in worse shape than many expected and the Federal
Reserve would keep interest rates low, say people familiar with the matter.
If it holds, its $15 billion gain would vault Bridgewater, already one of the world's most successful hedge-fund
firms, into the pantheon of investors that have achieved huge one-year gains connected to the country's
credit crisis. But unlike other investors who have made a fortune trading on a single asset type, such as
bonds backed by subprime mortgages or securities of big banks, Bridgewater essentially places bets on the
entire world.
Founded 35 years ago by Ray Dalio, a Harvard Business School graduate known for his philosophical
musings, Bridgewater is at the forefront of a strategy called macro investing, which entails trading big buckets
of stocks, currencies and commodities based on macroeconomic forces like politics, regulation and monetary
policy.
Bridgewater contends that the U.S. and other developed economies are undergoing a painful process of
deleveraging, as consumer debts are being brought in line with incomes. The process, which it says last
occurred in the U.S. during the Great Depression, can entail about a decade of lackluster growth and defies
typical boom-and-bust cycles.
Ironically, some of Bridgewater's clients, generally big institutional investors such as pension funds, are
themselves deeply involved in global economic struggles, and in some cases have been hurt by them.
"The economic reality of the world is playing exactly into Bridgewater's view," says Ken Miranda, the chief
investment officer for the International Monetary Fund's employee pension plan, which has invested with
Bridgewater since the mid-1980s. "Other managers have seen this downturn as more cyclical, but they were
right that this is more structural in nature."
The IMF has shelled out billions to stabilize financial systems in Greece and across Europe this year and
recently downgraded economic growth estimates for the U.S.
Bridgewater's success of late will also benefit many U.S. public pension funds that invest in the hedge fund,
including the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois. As of 2009, the pension fund had unfunded
liabilities totaling $35 billion, which have been exacerbated by recent economic problems, says spokesman
Dave Urbanek. "It's the yin and the yang," Mr. Urbanek said of Bridgewater's winning bets on economic
weaknesses.
Timing a macro bet can be tough. In 2009, Bridgewater's largest fund eked out a 2% gain, while the stock
market had one of the greatest rallies in recent memory. "Many of the pressures we thought were building in
2009 happened to play out in 2010," said Bridgewater co-Chief Executive Greg Jensen.
Other investors have made similar bets this year. But Bridgewater stands out for the scale of its wager. With
about $86 billion under management overall and about 1,000 people on staff, Bridgewater has honed its
macro thesis studying other periods of deleveraging throughout history, such as the Great Depression and
Japan during the 1990s.
The firm implements that historical research into computer-executed trading principles across about 100
different markets. "If a country gathers excess reserves, then this happens; if oil does X, then this happens,"
Mr. Jensen says.

One of Bridgewater's biggest gains came from its bullish investment in Treasurys, says Mr. Jensen. The fund
believed demand for such government bonds would remain high as investors sought safe returns amid
heightened economic uncertainty. In the spring, when some investors thought signs of economic growth
would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, Bridgewater stuck by its thesis that rates would
stay near zero and Treasurys would remain attractive. The Dow Jones CBOT Treasury Index is up 12% this
year.
"We thought, based on our understanding of how deleveragings play out, that there would be plenty of
demand for Treasurys," said Mr. Jensen.
Also helping drive Bridgewater's returns: a bullish investment in the Japanese yen, which has risen nearly
16% since May. The yen's rise is being driven by a weaker dollar and China's recent purchases of the
Japanese currency.
Another big moneymaker has been gold, a commodity that has risen roughly 20% in value this year as
investors flee major world currencies in decline.
Like many macro hedge funds, Bridgewater uses leverage to amplify returns. Mr. Jensen called Bridgewater's
leverage a "moderate, controlled amount that has been tested through many crises, including 2008."
Bridgewater stands to take 20% of the profits it earns, in addition to management fees of 1% to 2%,
according to a person familiar with the firm's fee structure.
Even before this year's gains, Mr. Dalio has been estimated to have a net worth of $4 billion, according to
Forbes.
The roughly 38% return through nearly 10 months of the year was in the largest of Bridgewater's Pure Alpha
funds. The fund's investments are designed to be uncorrelated to the stock market, and the fund is closed to
new investors. Bridgewater's other major fund, All Weather, which employs a less risky, asset-allocation
strategy, has gains of 23%, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Bridgewater's returns, impressive in almost any year, come as average hedge-fund returns have totaled 4.8%
this year through September, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc. Macro funds on average were up 3.5%
through September.
A possible risk to Bridgewater's thesis is that the economy gathers steam and the firm isn't onto it quickly
enough.
Mr. Jensen says it isn't likely that Bridgewater can repeat the same blockbuster returns next year. The fund is
aiming for its 10-year average annual return of 18%: "You are not going to ever nail it every time."

ETF Holds Precious Blend --- Metals Fund Launches Friday; 'One-Size-Fits-All Solution'

ETF Holds Precious Blend --- Metals Fund Launches Friday; 'One-Size-Fits-All Solution'

With demand soaring for gold, silver and other precious metals, a new exchange-traded fund is rolling out,
targeting investors who want to own them all.
The ETFS Physical Precious Metals Basket Shares, which will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on Friday, is designed to hold a blend of four precious metals: gold, silver, platinum and palladium. It will be
the first precious-metal basket to be launched in the U.S.
This year, gold is up 23% and platinum up 15%, eclipsed by the gains in silver and palladium, up 42% and
45%, respectively.
Many wealth managers and financial advisers want to own precious metals but have to make a choice of
which one, said William Rhind, strategic director of U.S. business development at ETF Securities Ltd., which
is managing the fund. "This allows a one-size-fits-all solution," he said.
However, because prices have had such a big rally already, future gains may be tougher. Analysts said that
precious metals are vulnerable to short-term corrections, especially if investor views of the macroeconomic
picture change. For example, all four metals plunged Tuesday in reaction to China's surprise move to raise
interest rates.
The new product marks the latest foray into the U.S. market by ETF Securities, a London commodity ETF
provider. The company runs four ETFs in the U.S. to track each of the metals, with total assets exceeding $2
billion.
For the new blended product, each share will be backed by 0.03 troy ounce of gold, 1.1 ounces of silver,
0.004 ounce of platinum and 0.006 ounce of palladium.
The weights are determined by the metals' global industrial demand.
The new fund will store its metals in vaults managed by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in London and Zurich.

Treasurys Rally on Fed --- The 30-Year Continues Resurgence; Easing Is 'Key Driver'

Treasurys Rally on Fed --- The 30-Year Continues Resurgence; Easing Is 'Key Driver'

NEW YORK -- The 30-year Treasury bond rallied Wednesday, leading a rebound in the bond market on
speculation that the Federal Reserve will step up government-debt buying to support the economy.
The benchmark 10-year note erased earlier losses to trade flat. The 30-year bond gained for a third session
in a row.
"I still believe that the continued evidence of a lack of inflation coupled with a Fed pledge to buy longer dated
assets give investors a window of investment opportunity that is rarely available and with so much clarity,"
said Kevin Giddis, president of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan Inc. in Memphis, Tenn.
Late afternoon, the price of the benchmark 10-year note was flat to yield 2.472% and the 30-year bond was
12/32 higher to yield 3.893%. The two-year note was 1/32 higher to yield 0.351%. Bond prices move
inversely to yields.
At the peak of the rally, the five-year note's yield touched a record low of 1.069%.
Buyers have returned to the 30-year bond since the start of the week, a shift from the previous few weeks
when the longest maturity in the Treasury market had suffered heavy losses.
The yield premium investors demand to own the 30-year bond rather than the benchmark 10-year note fell to
1.42 percentage points Wednesday after surging to a record high of 1.45 percentage points on October 15.
The 30-year bond had been hurt by some concern that it may not be the favorite in the Fed's bond-buying
program. Some investors also fretted that the Fed's stimulus may generate inflation in the longer term, which
hurts the value of the 30-year maturity the most.
"I think the bond starts to have value outright around 4%," said Hicham Hajhamou, a Treasury trader in New
York at BNP Paribas Securities Corp., noting that some investors bought 30-year bonds while selling the
10-year and five-year notes as a relative value trade.
Treasurys fell earlier in the morning as demand for relatively safe assets eased. Riskier assets from U.S.
stocks to crude oil posted strong gains after tumbling a day earlier on a surprising interest-rate boost from
China.
Buyers returned on market chatter about details regarding the Federal Reserve's Treasury-buying program,
which energized some investors to bet the Fed will announce a bond-buying program in its monetary policy
meeting in early November.
The wagers hurt the dollar, pushing it to a 15-year low against the yen, as the Fed's monetary stimulus is
tantamount to printing more U.S. currency. While the fall in the dollar boosts U.S. exports, it fuels worries
about inflation, spurring demand for gold.
The Fed's stimulus also fueled investors' risk appetites, boosting buying in stocks, higher-yielding currencies
and emerging-market equities and bonds.
"[Quantitative easing] is the key driver for overall markets now," said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading in New York at Guggenheim Partners LLC.
A key economic survey from the central bank released Wednesday afternoon showed that economic activity
continued to rise modestly in September and early October, with housing markets staying weak and
consumer prices tame.

The "beige book," a reference for the central bank's monetary-policy meeting in early November, contained
little fresh information on the economy, but it supported arguments from many Fed policy makers that the
current pace of the economic recovery will be too slow to cut unemployment and lift overly low levels of
inflation.
"The beige book clearly does nothing to steady our nerves surrounding the outlook for growth," said David
Semmens, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. "With inflation limited to primary inputs
and growth continuing to disappoint there is nothing to stop the Fed going ahead" with more monetary
stimulus in November.
The Treasury Department is set to release the sizes for next week's new government notes supply at 11 a.m.
EDT Thursday.

Caterpillar Mines a Modern-Day Gold Rush
The first man to make a fortune from the 19th-century California gold rush did so not by selling gold, but by
selling shovels. Caterpillar Inc., in that sense, is like a modern-day version of that man, Samuel Brannan.
On Thursday, the construction- and mining-equipment company is likely to post third-quarter earnings of
$1.09 a share, up from 64 cents a year ago and 85 cents in the second quarter, according to Thomson
Reuters. Revenue is expected to jump by more than 40% year-on-year to $10.5 billion.
That partly reflects Caterpillar's dismal performance during the third quarter of 2009. Machinery sales, which
account for about two-thirds of its revenue, are seen nearly doubling from a year ago, according to Goldman
Sachs. Engine sales, about a third of its business, are expected to jump about 24%.
Caterpillar's rebound also is due to robust demand for heavy equipment from fast-growing emerging markets.
As recently as 2006, the majority of Caterpillar's annual revenue came from North America. This year, that
share is expected to be just 35%. Europe's share has fallen, too. In contrast, Asia and Latin America
combined are expected to account for 40% of sales in 2010, a doubling since 2006.
The company is also benefiting from a modern-day gold rush. Strong demand, combined with the weaker
U.S. dollar, has pushed up prices for commodities and precious metals, spurring a mining boom. That is good
news for Caterpillar, which has 55% of the global market for mining trucks, according to Goldman analyst
Jerry Revich. The company also is getting back into the mining-shovel business that it exited from in 2004.
Beyond this quarter, Caterpillar faces hurdles. The first is high expectations. Its shares aren't wildly expensive
by historical standards, but they have surged roughly 40% this year. Higher expenses to comply with new
emissions standards plus still-weak pricing power could also mean profit margins fall short next year of the
peak levels many currently expect.
The staying power of the commodity boom is another concern, although the Federal Reserve's desire to
stoke inflation could keep that going for some time. Caterpillar had better hope so, since it could suffer from
a drop in prices or demand. Its shovels, after all, are only as valuable as the stuff they are mining.

NEW YORK -- Treasurys rallied broadly Tuesday as interest-rate decisions from China and Canada fanned
worries about the global economic outlook.
Investors sought safety in low-risk U.S. government debt, helping bonds recover from earlier losses. The
30-year bond led the buying, with its yield falling back below 4%.
A surprising interest-rate increase from the People's Bank of China and a significant reduction of economic
forecasts by the Bank of Canada raised investors' anxiety.
Concern about soured mortgages in the U.S. added to the jittery tone in the financial markets.
Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, BlackRock Inc. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
are attempting to force Bank of America Corp. to repurchase poorly performing mortgages packaged by
Countrywide Financial Group, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday afternoon.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday that a group of institutional bond investors are stepping up
efforts to recoup losses on soured mortgage portfolios at Bank of America.
U.S. stocks, crude oil and emerging-market equities and bonds dropped.
The safe-haven U.S. dollar rallied while many higher-yielding currencies linked to global economic growth,
including the Australian and Canadian dollars, tumbled.
"You are seeing some flight-to-quality play here," said David Coard, head of fixed-income trading in New York
at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional investors.
Late afternoon, the price of the benchmark 10-year note was 6/32 higher to yield 2.472%. The two-year note
was unchanged to yield 0.359%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
Demand for Treasurys also picked up as some investors bet that the Federal Reserve may be forced to step
up its government-debt purchases in coming months should the global growth outlook deteriorate.
The recent mixed data had pushed some investors to cut bets on a shock-and-awe approach from the Fed to
buying government bonds aimed at pushing down long-term interest rates for households and companies.
But Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley, who votes on monetary policy, on
Tuesday pointed to a "wholly unsatisfactory" U.S. economy, adding to his case for more monetary stimulus to
kick-start growth.
"If the economy starts to really slow now that China is raising rates to slow its growth, the Fed will have no
choice but to do a massive [government-bond buying program] in the back end of the Treasury market," said
Michael Franzese, head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities in New York.
"The bets are being put on and long-dated Treasurys benefit," he said.
Bonds fell earlier on a better-than-forecast earnings report from Goldman Sachs Holdings Inc. and an
unexpected rise in housing starts.
Hicham Hajhamou, a Treasurys trader at BNP Paribas Securities Corp. in New York, said the selling Tuesday
in stocks, crude oil, gold and long-dated Treasurys resulted from accounts booking profits ahead of an
uncertain announcement regarding the size and timing of the Fed's bond-buying program.

--- Page 168 ---
Page 168 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The 10-year Treasury note's yield dropped to 2.332% on Oct. 8, the lowest level since January 2009, as bets
grew on the Fed to step up buying in government bonds to support the economy at its November policy
meeting.
The yield, a benchmark for corporate and consumer borrowings, has since rebounded and hit an October
high of 2.592% Friday as many traders said the market has priced in much about the so-called quantitative
easing.
"While no one is going to fight the Fed, the big question is how much of a purchase they may announce. Add
to that nominally positive data, and that set the tone for selling in the bond market," said Christian Cooper,
head of U.S. dollar derivatives trading at Jefferies & Co. in New York.
The 30-year bond had suffered heavy losses in recent weeks as some investors were worried that the Fed's
easy-monetary policy will fan inflation in the long term.
The yield touched 4.019% Monday, the highest level since Aug. 11.
The 30-year bond's value will be eroded the most by rises in consumer prices.

China Sparks Wide Sell-Off --- Sudden Rate Hike Spurs Fear of Drop in Giant's Growth; Emerging Currencies Pull Back
China Sparks Wide Sell-Off --- Sudden Rate Hike Spurs Fear of Drop in Giant's Growth; Emerging
Currencies Pull Back

China surprised investors by raising interest rates Tuesday, sparking a world-wide sell-off in stocks,
commodities and emerging-markets currencies as investors lowered their expectations for Chinese growth,
which has been seen as a key driver of the global economy.
China's central bank announced it would raise key rates by a quarter percentage point, the first move since it
cut rates in December 2008.While many investors had been expecting China to raise interest rates in
coming months, the timing of the move was unexpected. It is viewed as the first in a series of interest rate
increases.
Currency markets, where exchange rates reflect bets by investors scouring the globe for the highest returns,
reacted swiftly. On the assumption that China's rate boost will damp its economy, investors removed some
bets on the currencies of other surging markets, and money flowed back to the U.S. dollar. Australia, seen as
closely linked to Chinese growth, saw its currency fall 2.6% against the dollar. The U.S. dollar rose 1.8%
against the Canadian dollar and 0.6% against the Brazilian real.
Investors were split on the impact China's move will have on currency diplomacy. Tensions have been
building as a result of the money flooding into emerging markets, driving up the currencies of countries such
as Brazil and South Korea against the dollar.
Because China effectively pegs the yuan to the dollar, exporters in those countries have been losing
competitiveness against China, their chief rival in the global markets. In response, many governments have
been pushing back against the tide of money boosting their currencies.
Those issues were front and center Tuesday. Brazil raised the tax on foreign investment in Brazilian bonds.
And in Seoul, the South Korean finance minister said the government was considering reinstating a
withholding tax on foreign investors' holdings in some Korean securities.
The impact of China's rate rise was also felt in the commodity markets, where Chinese demand plays a
significant role in setting prices.
Oil prices suffered their biggest decline in eight months, losing more than 4% to $79.49. Gold, which set a
record high last week, fell $36.10 per troy ounce, or 2.63% to $1335.10.
Stocks, too, took a hit, although the sell-off in the U.S. was also fueled by renewed concerns about the impact
that home loan foreclosure problems will have on banks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.5% to
close at 10978.62. In early trading Wednesday in Asia, markets fell, with resource stocks leading the
declines. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was down 1.7% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was off 1.3%.
Traders say the market swings were likely magnified by the fact that China's move caught many investors off
guard. The People's Bank of China said Tuesday that it increased the benchmark one-year interest rates on
loans and deposits by a quarter of a percentage point each. The last time it raised interest rates was in
2007.
China's central bank, as usual, didn't elaborate on the reasons for its interest-rate move,which came two
days before key economic data for September and the third quarter are due.
"They are starting to see signs that growth is picking up . . . and now is the time to begin cautious tightening,"
said Daniel Katzive, a director in the currency strategy research team at Credit Suisse.
Some investors interpreted China's rate move as a sign the country might rein in a steady but gradual
appreciation of its currency against the dollar seen recently. That's in part because a rising currency, like

--- Page 170 ---
Page 170 of 202 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
higher interest rates, serves as a brake on inflation -- thus a rate increase means it wouldn't need to allow
the currency to rise as quickly.
Following the rate news Tuesday, pricing on derivatives known as nondeliverable forwards reflected
expectations of an increase in the yuan of 3% over the next twelve months. On Monday, investors had been
betting on a nearly 4% appreciation.
However, economists believe stubbornly high housing prices were one of the main drivers for Tuesday's
move, and that raising interest rates is a more direct way to attack that problem than through the currency
markets.
China's interest-rate move marks a shift in strategy by authorities. Until now, they had been relying on
administrative controls such as limits on bank lending and changes in required mortgage down-payments to
modulate growth.
"Today's decision to hike rates suggests that Beijing feels these earlier, more targeted measures are no
longer enough to keep the economy on an even keel," said Royal Bank of Canada economist Brian Jackson
Since late August, investors have been adding to their bets on emerging markets. Fueling that wager:
expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon pump at least $500 billion into the U.S. financial system in an
effort to boost the struggling American economy. Some of that money is expected to find its way to emerging
markets, which offer higher yields and prospects for asset-price growth. That effort was also seen as
devaluing the U.S. dollar.
In Japan, where the yen has risen sharply against the dollar in recent months, the country's finance minister
Tuesday expressed renewed concerns over its strength, declaring the government's readiness to intervene in
the currency market and urging global leaders to work together to stabilize exchange rates. The Japanese
government downgraded its view on the economy for the first time in more than a year and a half.
Also Tuesday, Canada's central bank halted a string of interest-rate hikes it started in June, warning that
international currency tensions could hamper global recovery.
Although the broader reaction in the financial markets suggested a scaling back of expectations about
China's growth prospects, another interpretation was that it is actually good news for the global economy.
"Generally we see this as a broadly positive development, that policy makers are more confident of the
economic trends," said Manik Narain, emerging markets strategist at UBS in London. "All in all, this is China
coming from a position of strength."

Dow Declines 165.07 On China, Bank Jolts
Tuesday's Markets
Dow Declines 165.07 On China, Bank Jolts

China's move to slow its economy collided with concerns about the foreclosure crisis to roil financial markets
on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day since mid-August, falling below 11000 and wiping out
two weeks of gains. The average remains up 5.3% for the year. Bank stocks slid. Crude-oil futures fell below
$80 a barrel in its biggest one-day decline in eight months, and gold dropped 2.6%.
While China's move to tighten interest rates was relatively small, its timing surprised investors, many of
whom had been fixated on the U.S. market, where the Federal Reserve is expected to soon embark on a new
round of monetary easing.
The Dow fell 165.07 points, or 1.5%, to 10978.62.
Tuesday's decline -- on the anniversary of the Black Monday crash of 1987 -- snapped a rally that many had
feared was getting long in the tooth. Stocks had rallied 11% since the end of August, in large part because of
optimism that the Fed's stimulus would help fuel U.S. economic growth. But the gains belied worries that the
Fed's action may not be enough to help juice the economy or drive corporate revenue. The recent debacle
over foreclosures has only added to the nagging uncertainty.
"It just shows the nervousness of this market -- in the first few weeks of October, people have had this
nervous sense that something's going to break, this market can't just keep going up," said Ryan Larson, the
Chicago-based head of U.S. equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management.
At the same time, the dollar enjoyed a one-day rebound, surging more than 1% against the euro, the pound,
the Swiss franc and the Australian and Canadian dollars.
The sectors most exposed to global demand were the heaviest weights on the market, with energy and
materials sagging at the prospect of a Chinese belt-tightening.
But Bank of America was the largest decliner, falling 4.4% to close at its lowest point since the financial crisis,
after reports that a group of institutional investors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were suing the
Charlotte, N.C., lender over mortgage securities. Other big banks shadowed BofA's decline, with J.P. Morgan
Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all shedding 1.3% or more.
"This is a reminder that much of the mortgage mess remains unresolved," said Brian Lazorishak, portfolio
manager and quantitative analyst at Chase Investment Counsel.
Also weighing on the markets were technology stocks, which suffered from robust earnings from giants Apple
and International Business Machines that nonetheless failed to impress the market.
Apple dropped 2.7%, while IBM lost 3.4%, bringing the two bellwethers off all-time highs reached on Monday.
Yahoo, which fell 2.7% in Tuesday trading, recouped some of those losses after quadrupling quarterly profits
after the market close.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.8%.
Ominously for market bulls, the losses came amid an increase in stock trading, with 5.7 billion shares
changing hands in New York Stock Exchange composite volume -- about 25% higher than Monday's trading
volume.

In another reflection of the investor skittishness, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
"fear gauge" known as the VIX, jumped off its recent lows, rising as much as 12% during the day.
"The fact we're seeing heavier volume adds some legitimacy to the dip," said Mark Turner, co-head of sales
trading for Instinet. "The Apple and IBM numbers got us off to a disappointing start last night, and the news
out of China this morning had the dollar higher and commodities lower."
Jerry Webman, chief economist and senior investment officer with OppenheimerFunds, attributed some of the
market pessimism to a speech by Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher, who said that
"no decisions have been made" on another round of Treasury buying by the Fed.
"The Fed can wave the magic wand, but behind it, we need to see what might be unrealistic wishful thinking
and temper our enthusiasm," Mr. Webman said. "There was a whole series of things today -- 'Fedspeak,'
China tightening, Apple's guidance, revenue numbers and some of the technical data suggesting we're in an
overbought market."
Among stocks in focus, Coldwater Creek plunged 35% after the women's apparel retailer sharply cut its fiscal
third-quarter guidance below already-cautious expectations.

Dollar Pummels Its Rivals On Global-Slowdown View

Dollar Pummels Its Rivals On Global-Slowdown View

NEW YORK -- The dollar racked up gains across the currency board Tuesday after China surprised investors
by increasing key interest rates in an effort to put a brake on its rapid economic growth, while the Bank of
Canada issued a tepid assessment of the global recovery.
Worried about the specter of a global slowdown, investors rushed into the perceived safety of the dollar,
sending the ICE Dollar index, which tracks the greenback's performance against a trade-weighted basket of
currencies, shooting more than 1.5% higher on the day, its strongest gain in more than two months.
The move into the dollar is a reversal of its recent performance, as the U.S. currency has been under
pressure in recent weeks with investors speculating the Federal Reserve could soon act to stimulate the
sagging U.S. economy.
China's surprise rate rise sent investors scrambling into the dollar, pressuring assets that have been bet
against it, including gold, oil and stocks, where even good earnings reports haven't stanched the bleeding. A
slower recovery in both China and the U.S. would squelch the appetite for commodities in particular.
"Any attempt to slow the Chinese economy will have ramifications," across the globe, said John McCarthy,
manager of currency trading at ING Capital Markets in New York.
The China decision also led investors out of currencies tied to the pace of global growth, especially the
commodity-linked Australian and New Zealand dollars, which depend on China's growth and which both
dropped against the dollar. After touching parity against the greenback Friday, the Australian dollar has
dropped below 97 U.S. cents, losing more than 2% against the greenback on Tuesday.
"Investors are nervous," said Amelia Bourdeau, senior G-10 currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Conn.
Ms. Bourdeau said that is because a slowdown in China could spread to other emerging-market economies,
while investors also worry the Fed's response to the U.S.'s slowing economy won't be enough to kickstart
domestic growth.
By day's end, the euro was at $1.3730 from $1.3992 late Monday. The common currency dipped as low as
$1.3739, its lowest level in two weeks. The dollar was at 81.55 yen from 81.18, while the euro was at 111.97
yen from 113.59. The U.K. pound was at $1.5701 from $1.5932. The dollar was at 0.9704 Swiss francs from
0.9560.

Fed's Danger of Leaks With 'QE'

Fed's Danger of Leaks With 'QE'

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Ben Bernanke has opened the door to further policy easing in the U.S. His challenge now may be to keep
investors from exiting through it.
The Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate investment in the U.S. economy have become much more
complicated now that investors have plenty of other, more attractive assets -- and other countries -- to choose
from. Already, the protection against dollar debasement and inflation promised by commodities and precious
metals is luring investors. So are the greater growth prospects of emerging markets. Emerging-market equity
funds, including ETFs, have taken in nearly $60 billion year-to-date, according to EPFR Global. Global
precious metals and commodity funds have added about $19 billion. U.S. equity funds, meanwhile, have
seen $50 billion of outflows.
Most Fed officials would argue this isn't worth losing sleep over. The more money that flows into emerging
economies, the more it should lift demand for U.S. exports. The more that stokes inflation abroad, the more
it should help avoid deflation at home.
But further quantitative easing risks creating new distortions while falling short of the Fed's aim to reduce the
nation's 9.6% unemployment rate. Export-led growth, if it can be achieved, is likely to come from more
capital-intensive than labor-intensive industries. The manufacturing sector, for example, has added 114,000
workers this year but now employs just 11.6 million workers, a third fewer than it did a decade ago. Trade,
transportation and warehousing, meanwhile, employ far more U.S. workers -- a total of about 29 million -- but
have added proportionately fewer jobs, some 176,000, so far this year.
European Central Bank official Lorenzo Bini Smaghi singled out this concern in a recent speech. "If anything,
keeping the cost of capital excessively low may encourage capital-intensive investment, rather than
labor-intensive capital expenditure," he said. "Monetary policy cannot, by itself, transform a jobless recovery
into a job-generating recovery."
There is another risk: that investors' preference for gold and other stores of value in anticipation of more
quantitative easing pushes the Fed's new money into a hole. IHS Global Insight economist Brian Bethune
calls it the "gold trap": Investors are parking funds in nonproductive assets like gold that undermine the Fed's
efforts to generate activity.
The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has taken seen roughly $6 billion of inflows this year, according to Morningstar
and now has some $50 billion in assets. That is still pretty small in the scheme of things, but the Fed hasn't
even officially embarked on its next round of quantitative easing. Policy makers may find it tougher than
expected to inflate this leaky balloon.

Appreciating Assets
Stocks and commodities gained this week on speculation the Fed will announce a second round of asset
purchases. Blue chips rose 0.5%, while gold closed at a record $1,373.45 on Thursday. The dollar,
meanwhile, dropped to 81.43 yen, a 15-year low.
Transparency Rules
The Labor Department announced new requirements for 401(k) plans on Thursday. The biggest change?
Plan sponsors now are required to disclose to investors the dollar amount of fees deducted from their account
and what services the fees cover.
Home-Loan Lows
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 4.19% this week, Freddie Mac reported, the lowest
rate since April 1951. The number of refinance applications shot up by 21% as homeowners sought to lock in
lower monthly payments.

Oil Falls 1.7% to Settle Near $81

Oil Falls 1.7% to Settle Near $81

NEW YORK -- Crude futures tumbled, nearing $81 a barrel on a rebound in the dollar.
Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $1.44, or 1.7%, to settle at $81.25 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after falling as low as $80.75.
Crude slid through the session as the greenback bounced back from fresh eight-month lows. A speech from
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke kept open the possibility of further stimulus, but investors worried
that stocks and energy markets, as well as the dollar, had accounted for the potential central bank actions
already.
"Traders are ringing the register and getting out of their long positions in the equities and energy," said Brian
LaRose, a technical energy analyst at United-ICAP. "If the dollar really does start to show signs of life, I have
a real feeling the energy and equities could have some serious, serious trouble moving forward."
Oil prices have used movements in the dollar as a signpost in recent weeks, rallying to five-month highs last
week as the greenback fell. A weaker dollar makes oil cheaper for buyers in other currencies. The recent
tumble has pushed investors into hard assets including oil, gold and other commodities.
Market participants also were watching widespread strikes in France, which have hit the country's energy
infrastructure. The industrial action to protest against national pension overhaul has prompted France's
refineries to either reduce or stop production, the Confederation Generale du Travail union said.
Another strike at France's southern Fos-Lavera port entered its 19th day Friday, causing a backlog of 62
ships. Fos-Lavera is the world's third-largest oil port.

What Bernanke Didn't Say

Amid the dollar rout of the 1970s, Treasury Secretary John Connally famously told a group of fretting
Europeans that the greenback "is our currency, but your problem." If you read between the lines, that's also
more or less what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said yesterday as he made the case for further
Fed monetary easing.
Mr. Bernanke broke no new ground in explaining why he believes inflation at less than 2% is too low and
why the Fed must encourage greater inflation to reduce the 9.6% jobless rate. "Inflation is running at rates
that are too low [his emphasis] relative to the levels that the [Fed Open Market] Committee judges to be most
consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate in the longer run," he said. That dual mandate is to
maintain stable prices and low unemployment, and Mr. Bernanke's message couldn't be clearer that cutting
the U.S. jobless rate is now Job One at the Fed.
We were more struck by what Mr. Bernanke didn't say. In a nearly 4,000-word speech about inflation, the
Fed chief never once mentioned the value of the dollar. He never mentioned exchange rates, despite the
turmoil in world currency markets as the dollar has fallen in anticipation of further Fed easing. He never
mentioned rising commodity prices or soaring gold, and his only reference to the recent increase in the price
of oil was by way of dismissing it in the context of overall low inflation.
The chairman's message is that the Fed is focused entirely on the domestic U.S. economy and will print as
many dollars as it takes to reflate it. The rest of the world is on its own and can adjust its policies as various
countries see fit. If other currencies soar in relation to the dollar, that's someone else's problem. For the sake
of the U.S. and world economy, we hope this turns out better for Mr. Bernanke's reputation than it did for John
Connally's.

Oct. 11-15
U.S.
-- The foreclosure scandal gathered steam, driving down bank stocks and weighing on mortgage bonds, as
J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, among others, took steps to halt or review
proceedings. At the heart of the mess is the work of "robo-signers," people who signed thousands of
documents without proper review. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, drawn into the tumult, told mortgage
processors to stop sending cases to a Florida law firm. Attorneys general from all 50 states are investigating.
-- The Obama administration lifted its ban on deep-water oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, more than six
weeks earlier than expected. The ban was criticized for putting thousands of jobs at risk. Interior Secretary
Salazar warned that rig operators seeking permits now must comply with stiffened safety rules.
-- A federal judge ordered the military to stop enforcing the "don't ask, don't tell" law, putting at least a
temporary halt to the 17-year-old policy on sexual orientation. The order poses a dilemma for the White
House and Democratic leaders. They want to undo the policy, but the Justice Department is generally
obligated to defend laws passed by Congress.
-- It's sticker shock at the drugstore, as more Americans with health insurance abandon their prescriptions --
often for crucial drugs -- amid rising co-payments and enrollment in high-deductible plans. "They just say, 'I
can't afford it. I can't get it,'" a Tennessee drugstore owner explained. "And they turn around and walk away."
-- Michelle Rhee announced her resignation as Washington, D.C.'s schools chancellor, after Mayor Fenty lost
his primary. Along with Secretary of Education Duncan, Rhee favored linking teacher evaluations to student
test scores and shutting failing schools.
---
Politics
-- Republican groups launched a $50 million ad campaign in a final push to help the GOP win a majority in
the House. The self-styled "House surge" is aimed at the few-dozen competitive races where Democratic
candidates have significantly more money. It comes as outside political groups, most of which don't have to
disclose donors, rival theparties' campaign committees. Democratic strategists acknowledged they are
abandoning a dozen House seats the party holds, as they try to salvage their majority by shoring up
candidates with better chances.
-- A Florida federal judge cleared the way for a challenge to the Obama administration's health-care overhaul,
keeping alive the plaintiffs' claim that a mandate requiring most Americans to carry health insurance is
unconstitutional. That contention is at the center of a nationwide legal challenge to the administration's
signature domestic-policy legislation, a top election issue. Incumbents such as Sen. Russ Feingold (D., Wis.)
are weaving their "yes" votes on the health-care overhaul into their campaigns as a strong stand for
consumers, but Democratic strategists concede the law hasn't been the rallying point they'd hoped.
-- At least 72 congressional aides on both sides of the aisle traded shares of companies their bosses help
oversee, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. Much of the trading was in industries dependent on
government help, such as financial services and renewable energy. Rep. Brian Baird (D., Wash.) vowed to
renew his efforts to outlaw insider trading by Capitol Hill members and their staffs.

-- The rescue of 33 miners trapped deep underground for 70 days came to a joyous close less than 24 hours
after the final operation began, a testament to each man's will and to the herculean technological effort.
Chilean President Pinera is reaping political gains from the victory.
-- The U.S. disclosed that it had been providing safe passage to Taliban to hold peace talks with Kabul, which
Washington had opposed. The Taliban denied participating but said some commanders may be negotiating
on their own.
-- A group of Chinese elders blasted censorship in an online letter that followed Premier Wen's call for
political reform. China blocked European officials from meeting the wife of the jailed Nobel Peace laureate,
who dedicated his prize to the "lost souls" of the 1989 shootings in Tiananmen Square.
-- Currency markets resumed their intense downward pressure on the U.S. dollar, further lifting currencies of
emerging markets, with few signs that global financial officials made progress in defusing tensions during last
weekend's talks in Washington.
-- Palestinian leader Abbas is facing dissent within his own party amid stalled peace talks after Israel's
cabinet passed a bill requiring a loyalty oath. Palestinians rejected an Israeli offer to restart a West Bank
settlement freeze in return for recognition.
-- Ahmadinejad, in his first state visit, offered Lebanon Tehran's support for fighting U.S. and Israeli influence.
-- British and U.S. officials in Afghanistan rushed out a statement about the death of a Scottish aid worker
before a full review of what went wrong on the mission to rescue her, coalition officials said. Officials initially
blamed her death on her Taliban captors but now are scrambling to find out why a U.S. trooper tossed a
grenade that likely killed Linda Norgrove.

Business
-- Yahoo drew preliminary private-equity interest. Several firms, including Silver Lake Partners and
Blackstone Group, have been toying with the idea of taking the company private, including a scenario in
which they join forces with AOL to acquire it.
-- A big Swiss shipping company and Royal Dutch Shell, one of its customers, are close to settling
foreign-bribery charges stemming from a three-year U.S. probe. It could be the first in a series of settlements
by multinational companies.
-- Pfizer agreed to buy King Pharmaceuticals, a small drug maker that sells painkillers, in a $3.6 billion cash
deal that would put it in a $6 billion U.S. opioid market.
-- Google signaled a resurgence in online advertising, posting a 32% jump in third-quarter profit and a 23%
increase in revenue. Intel reported its own jump in earnings for the quarter, of 59%, and issued upbeat
comments on tech spending, allaying fears of a sharp slowdown in computer demand. GE suffered an 18%
drop in profit as it added $1.1 billion to reserves for the 2008 sale of its Japan consumer-finance business.
-- Microsoft launched its latest assault on the smartphone market with a bevy of handsets based on
overhauled software. The company released its new Windows Phone 7 operating system, two years in the
making.
-- Apple will start selling the iPad through Verizon Wireless stores on Oct. 28, further strengthening the ties
between the two companies and expanding distribution of the tablet computer ahead of the holidays.
-- GM, preparing for an initial public stock offering next month, plans to price its shares at about $20 each.
-- The Boston Red Sox owners said they bought Liverpool Football Club for GBP 300 million ($479 million)
from Tom Hicks and George Gillett, bringing an end to the fight for the 118-year-old English soccer franchise.
---
Markets
-- Wall Street firms are expected to pay a record $144 billion in compensation and benefits this year.
Estimated 2010 profit of $61.3 billion still falls 20% below the 2006 peak. The first of the big banks to report
earnings, J.P. Morgan Chase, said third-quarter profit beat expectations, as it set aside less cash for loans
that might go bad. But the firm's total revenue was down, putting pressure on bankers' compensation at the
company. Revenue is also expected to decline at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which report next
week.

-- The Dow industrials rose 0.5% to 11062.78 this week. The widely watched "fear gauge" suggested stock
investors may be growing complacent, reassured by expectations that quantitative easing will boost share
prices. For the week, gold rose 2% to $1,371.10 a troy ounce, and oil fell 1.7% to $81.25 a barrel. Cotton
prices touched their highest level in the 140 years the commodity has traded on an exchange, as heavy
Chinese buying and poor harvests are expected to keep supplies tight.
-- Former Countrywide Financial chief Angelo Mozilo agreed to pay $67.5 million to settle the SEC's fraud
case ahead of trial Tuesday. Mr. Mozilo also agreed to a permanent ban on serving as an officer or director of
a public company. The settlement, along with those of two other defendants, represents one of the biggest
crisis-era enforcement actions. In a separate SEC case, former car czar Steven Rattner neared a deal to pay
$6 million to settle a probe over his role in a "pay to play" scandal surrounding New York state's public
pension fund.
-- An internal watchdog cleared the SEC of improper conduct in its fraud case against Goldman Sachs,
finding no evidence the suit's timing was politically motivated. Goldman had settled the case for $550 million.
The matter centered on allegations that the bank misled clients about mortgage-linked securities.

Global monetary relations are in disarray. Exchange rates fluctuate wildly among the world's major trade
partners, spawning talk of protectionism and a currency war. Gold is soaring as the dollar slides, and
economists debate whether the biggest threat to U.S. recovery is deflation or inflation.
We need a giant of economics to help explain all this and recommend a remedy. Where in the world is Robert
Mundell when you need him?
As it turns out, Mr. Mundell -- the Columbia University professor who advocated the hard-money, low-tax
policy mix that broke stagflation in the early 1980s, and who received the Nobel Prize in 1999 for his work on
exchange rates -- happened to be in New York this week. It's a lucky break. When he's not at his
500-year-old castle in Italy, the "father of the euro" is usually en route to his next lecture somewhere in the
world.
"What is wrong with the global economy today?" I ask him. "How do we fix this monetary mess?"
We are sitting on a comfortably worn sofa in the parlor of his apartment near campus, drinking tea. Plush
fabrics drape the walls, along with Baroque paintings in ornately-gilded frames. And there are piles of books
in the adjoining rooms. Really. Thick piles of books are stacked in corners, heaped against walls, balanced on
short wooden tables.
"The problem started before World War I," Mr. Mundell commences. "The gold standard was working fairly
well. But it broke down because of the war and what happened in the 1920s. And then the U.S. started to
become so dominant in the world, with the dollar becoming the central currency after the 1930s, the whole
world economy shifted.
"Think of it like the solar system: It started with gold at the center, as the sun, but then Jupiter got bigger and
bigger until all the planets started circulating Jupiter instead."
"And the U.S. is Jupiter?" I deduce.
"Yes," he affirms, "and the spread of the dollar was just miraculous as it became the anchor for the Bretton
Woods fixed exchange rate system after World War II. The price of gold was fixed at $35 an ounce in 1934,
but by the time the U.S. got through the Korean War, the Vietnam war, with all the associated secular
inflation, the price level had gone up nearly three times.
"Gold became very undervalued; European countries traded in dollars for gold until the U.S. lost more than
half its stock. The U.S. went off gold in 1971, under Nixon, and nobody else has gone on it again."
Mr. Mundell, 77, is clearly in his element as he traces the monetary history of the last century. Like his
apartment, he radiates a charmingly disheveled elegance, jaunty in jeans and an open-necked cream shirt.
"So our problems today," I posit, "are related to the fact that the Bretton Woods system of fixed
exchange-rates linked to gold broke down?"
"The system broke down," he hastens to explain, "not because of fixed rates. Fixed exchange rates operate
between California and New York . . . the system broke down because there was no mechanism to keep the
world price level in line with the price of gold."
Atop the closest mound of books is a volume titled: "Shaping the Post-War World: The Clearing Union." It
features the collected writings of John Maynard Keynes from 1940-1944, when the famous British economist
was helping to design a new international monetary order to provide a stable foundation for a world economy
devastated by war.

"Are you thinking," I venture, "that maybe it's time to start figuring out the design for a new international
monetary order? Should the U.S. offer new proposals regarding exchange rates and monetary policy?"
Mr. Mundell, who is Canadian, looks troubled. "I don't think the U.S. has any ideas, they don't have strong
leadership on the international economic side," he replies. "There hasn't been anyone in the administration for
a long time who really knows much about the international monetary system."
He elaborates that it would not be possible today to forge a monetary system with the dollar as the key
reserve currency, as President Franklin Roosevelt and Treasury Secretary Henry Morganthau did in the
1940s. "To be fair, America's position is not nearly as strong now," he concedes. "But what has disappointed
me is the reluctance of the U.S. to take into account this big movement in the rest of the world to do
something about restoring stability to the international monetary system." He frowns. "They ignore it, as if the
dollar's exchange rate is a mere domestic matter."
I take a sip of tea. "Do you think it has to do with our relationship with China?" The U.S. is threatening to
impose tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing doesn't make them more expensive by revaluing its currency.
"The U.S. berates China for its exchange rate policy, which Washington doesn't like," Mr. Mundell says,
noting that discriminatory tariffs against China might not be legal under the treaty provisions of the World
Trade Organization. "But one-sided pressure on China to change its exchange rate is misplaced."
Shaking his head, Mr. Mundell asserts: "The issue should not be treated as a bilateral dispute between the
U.S. and China. It's a multilateral issue because the U.S. deficit itself is a multilateral issue that is connected
with the international role of the dollar."
He goes on to explain that the dollar bloc includes China and other Asian countries -- except Japan -- but that
the euro now constitutes the rest of the world. "The euro today is the counter-dollar," he says. "The most
important initiative you could take to improve the world economy would be to stabilize the dollar-euro rate."
He thinks the European Central Bank, along with the Federal Reserve, should intervene in currency markets
to limit movement in the world's single most important exchange rate, pointing out that the dollar and euro
together represent 40% of the world economy.
"If the U.S. demurs, are we headed toward a global currency war?" I ask.
Mr. Mundell looks tentative. "I don't think it will come to a currency war," he says. "The U.S. is still very
powerful; it would be an unequal battle. But it's important to have a high-level conference to explore opinions
for reforming the world monetary system. The Europeans should be involved, as well as emerging countries."
He mentions that French President Nicolas Sarkozy recently spoke about the need to bring experts together
for an intellectual discussion on the issue, perhaps in China.
"So you think a fixed exchange-rate system is more conducive to global free trade and global economic
recovery than floating rates?" I ask.
Mr. Mundell registers surprise that I would even inquire. "The whole idea of having a free trade area when
you have gyrating exchange rates doesn't make sense at all. It just spoils the effect of any kind of free trade
agreement."
Coming from the man who helped design Europe's single currency, it makes perfect sense. Since its
introduction in 1999, the euro has eliminated exchange-rate fluctuations among the 16 trade partners who
have adopted it. In just over a decade, the euro has become the world's second largest reserve currency after
the dollar, and the second most-traded currency in foreign-exchange markets.
Which brings to mind another question. "What do you think about the rise in currency trading by banks, with
some $4 trillion now turning over daily in global currency markets?"
Mr. Mundell thrusts out his arms. "It's part of the sickness of the system! These currencies should be fixed, as
they were under Bretton Woods or the gold standard. All this unnecessary noise, unnecessary uncertainty; it
just confuses the ability to evaluate market prices."
Mr. Mundell has a knack for boiling things down to simple terms. He grew up on a four-acre farm in Ontario,
went on to earn a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and would ultimately challenge the
renowned Milton Friedman at the University of Chicago during the late 1960s. Both economists were strong
proponents of free markets, but Mr. Mundell disagreed with Mr. Friedman's advocacy of floating exchange
rates.
The sound of a buzzer indicates lunch has arrived. Mr. Mundell suggests that we continue our discussion at
the table and politely invites his assistant Ivy Ng, who has been taking careful notes, to join us.

"We've been talking about the possibility of global monetary reform," I continue, deciding to switch gears.
"Let's talk a bit about domestic monetary policy. What do you think the Federal Reserve should be doing
right now?"
It's a seamless transition for Mr. Mundell. "The Fed is making a big mistake by ignoring movements in the
price of the dollar, movements in the price of gold, in favor of inflation-targeting, which is a bad idea. The
Fed has always had the wrong view about the dollar exchange rate; they think the exchange rate doesn't
matter. They don't say that publicly, but that is their view."
"Well," I counter, not particularly savoring the role of devil's advocate, "I suppose Fed officials would argue
that their mandate is to try to achieve stable prices and maximum levels of employment."
Mr. Mundell looks annoyed. "Well, it's stupid. It's just stupid." He tries to walk it back somewhat. "I don't mean
Fed officials are stupid; it's just this idea they have that exchange-rate effects will eventually be taken into
account through the inflation-targeting approach. In the long run, it's not incorrect -- it takes about a year. But
why ignore the instant barometer that something is happening? The exchange rate is the immediate reaction
to pending inflation. Look what happened a couple weeks ago: The Fed started to say, we've got to print
more money, inflate the economy a little bit. The dollar plummeted! You won't get a change in the inflation
index for months, but a falling exchange rate -- that's the first signal."
Clearly on a roll, I press a bit. "You mentioned gold?"
"The price of gold is an index of inflation expectations," Mr. Mundell says without hesitation. "The rising price
of gold shows that people see huge amounts of debt being accumulated and they expect more money to be
pumped out." He purses his lips. "They might not necessarily be right; gold could be overvalued right now."
Sensing that the soup is getting cold, I decide to cut to the chase: "What would be your winning formula
today? What advice would you give to Washington that would help turn around our moribund economy?"
He pauses to think, but only for a moment. "Pro-growth tax policies, stable exchange rates."
And then, with his spoon poised over his own bowl, he smiles sweetly and beckons for us to begin. "Buon
appetito."

U.S. stocks closed modestly lower, as investors retreated from financials over concerns about banks'
foreclosure practices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.51 points, or 0.01%, to 11094.57, snapping a four-session winning
streak.
Financials led the Dow's decline Thursday. Bank of America dropped 69 cents, or 5.2%, to $12.60, and J.P.
Morgan Chase fell 1.12, or 2.8%, to 38.72. Both are among the wave of banks that are reviewing foreclosures
after temporarily suspending evictions due to concerns over "robo-signers," who approve hundreds of
foreclosure documents a day. Among other banks reviewing foreclosures, Wells Fargo fell 1.09, or 4.2%, to
24.72.
Regional banks Huntington Bancshares shed 16 cents, or 2.6%, to 5.72, while Fifth Third Bancorp fell 36
cents, or 2.8%, to 12.34, and Zions Bancorp lost 46 cents, or 2.1%, to 21.36.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite shed 5.85 points, or 0.2% to 2435.38. The Standard & Poor's
500-stock index fell 4.29 points, or 0.4% to 1173.81, weighed down by the financial sector's 1.8% decline.
U.S. jobs data added to jitters. The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits increased
more than expected last week. The U.S. trade deficit also widened in August.
Google reported earnings after Thursday's close. It declined during the session, shedding 2.37, or 0.4%, to
540.93, but jumped in after-hours trading after posting better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and
revenue.
Yahoo rose 68 cents, or 4.5%, to 15.93, after The Wall Street Journal reported AOL and several
private-equity firms, including Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group, are considering a possible
takeover bid for the Internet company.
Verizon Wireless, a unit of Verizon Communications, said it will sell Apple's iPad later this month, the first
time Verizon will sell an Apple product in its stores. AT&T separately said it also plans to carry the iPad in its
stores on the same day. Verizon gained 23 cents, or 0.7%, to 32.44, while AT&T added three cents, or 0.1%,
to 28.50. Apple rose 2.17, or 0.7%, to 302.31.
Apollo Group plunged 11.50, or 23%, to 38, after the for-profit education company withdrew its fiscal 2011
earnings projections, citing "the transitional state of the business and the uncertain regulatory environment."
Winnebago Industries fell 1.05, or 9.4%, to 10.12. The recreational-vehicle maker swung to a fiscal
fourth-quarter profit that easily topped analysts' estimates as revenue surged, but its backlog at the end of
August slid from a year earlier, a potentially troubling sign for investors who have fretted over future sales.
Office-products supplier OfficeMax dropped 82 cents, or 5.1%, to 15.21, after hiring Aramark executive Ravi
Saligram as president and chief executive, succeeding Sam Duncan, who will step down as chairman,
president and CEO, effective Nov. 7.
Crude oil fell, while gold advanced, settling at another high, at $1376.70.
Treasurys declined after an auction for 30-year bonds, considered the most sensitive to inflation worries,
drew weak demand. Yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 2.495%.

Specter of Stimulus Spurs a Run From Dollar

Specter of Stimulus Spurs a Run From Dollar

NEW YORK -- The dollar fell against a range of currencies Thursday as prospects for Asian economic growth
contrasted with the likely need for more stimulus in the U.S.
A monetary-tightening move by the Monetary Authority of Singapore accelerated the dollar's slide, knocking
the greenback to long-term lows against rivals around the globe before the dollar regained some poise in
New York trading.
Investors viewed Singapore's decision to widen and raise the Singapore dollar's trading band as an indication
Asian economies are strong enough to tolerate monetary tightening, while the dollar languishes under the
likelihood of more easing by the Federal Reserve.
"This continues a theme of what we have already seen," said Win Thin, senior currency strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York. There is very little reason to hold dollars as an investor now, and with
Federal Reserve stimulus largely priced in, Singapore's move gave investors another reason to sell dollars,
he said.
Investors will be listening closely Friday to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech at a conference in Boston
for clues on the timing and extent of any further quantitative-easing measures.
Any hints that asset-purchase programs might not be as extensive as once thought would support the
greenback, analysts said.
The Singapore news accelerated dollar selling that had already been stoked by concern over low U.S.
interest rates, a run-up in Asian equities this week and large gains in commodities like gold and oil. The
combination drove the yen and higher-yielding currencies to notable levels overnight.
Before later recovering, the dollar ground down to a fresh 15-year-low against the yen of 80.88 yen, with
investors on high alert for yen-weakening intervention by Japan. China's yuan surged to its highest point
against the dollar since the Chinese currency began regular trading in 1994. The South African rand rose to
its best level since January 2008, while the Turkish lira touched a two-year peak.
"A broader emerging-market move against the dollar is starting to become more acceptable," said Steven
Englander, a foreign-exchange strategist at Citigroup.
The euro rose to $1.4123 at one point, its highest level since January. The Canadian dollar traded below
parity for the first time since April, while the Australian dollar hit US$0.9993, its highest point since it was
floated in 1983. The dollar dropped to an all-time low against the Swiss franc at 0.9464 Swiss francs, though
those losses were later trimmed.
In New York trading, the dollar remained sharply down on the day even after recovering from its earlier lows.
But parity remained out of reach for the Canadian dollar, with the U.S. dollar trading at C$1.0031 from
C$1.0038 late Wednesday. It had reached a low of C$0.9976 in earlier trading.
"I think people were just a little worried about being overstretched at this point," Mr. Thin said.
Late in New York, the euro was at $1.4072 from $1.3957 from late Wednesday. The dollar was at 81.47 yen
from 81.77 yen, while the euro was at 114.64 yen from 114.12 yen. The pound was at $1.6003 from $1.5892.
The dollar was at 0.9529 Swiss francs from 0.9594 francs.
With the dollar perilously close to its all-time low against the yen, investors are keenly attuned to any reaction
from Japanese authorities.

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Thursday that excess volatility in foreign-exchange rates is
unfavorable, Kyodo News reported.
The comment came after the dollar fell briefly to 80.88 yen for the first time since April 1995.
Different trading systems report different levels as the all-time low in the dollar against the yen, but 79.75 yen
is widely viewed as the benchmark figure for the all-time low.
Interbank trading system EBS, which is often used as a source of market rates, puts the all-time low slightly
higher, marking it at 79.92 yen.

Stock-market bulls have had the Federal Reserve and a brightening economic picture on their side in recent
weeks. On Wednesday, the U.S. corporate sector joined in with a burst of strong earnings that propelled
stocks to a five-month high.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 75.68 points, or 0.7%, to finish at 11096.08, amid the strongest
trading volumes in three months, as investors afraid of missing out on the autumn rally jumped on the
bandwagon.
"There's only a few people questioning what happens if the Fed doesn't intervene, and so everyone's getting
on board," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. "Those who haven't been are
jumping in because they're fearful of being left behind, even if they don't like the idea of quantitative easing."
The day's gains were broad, with about three-fourths of the share volume advancing, boosted by higher
earnings from Intel and J.P. Morgan Chase. The better-than-expected numbers didn't help the two companies
themselves, which were among the worst blue-chip performers.
Still, J.P. Morgan's remarks on consumer lending lifted credit-card companies. Intel's comments on stronger
business spending made Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft the three best Dow performers.
Meanwhile, a jump in Chinese demand for commodities and the persistently weak dollar sent prices on
metals, oil and soft commodities to fresh highs. Gold rose above $1,370 an ounce, while copper reached
another two-year high. The euro, meanwhile, rose to touch $1.40 in intraday trading. The Canadian and
Australian dollars neared parity with the greenback.
"Throughout this rally, commodities have been the best performers, and I don't see that changing anytime
soon," said Michael Church, president of Addison Capital. "It's a global demand story. It's a currency story. It's
a weather-pattern story. It's all these things working at all once."

The dollar fell broadly Wednesday as the likelihood of more monetary easing and low interest rates in the
U.S. pushed investors toward higher-yielding assets.
Early Thursday, a surprise decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to tighten policy helped
accelerate dollar weakness. The move drove the Singapore dollar to a record high against its U.S.
counterpart, at S$1.2886, from around S$1.3020 before the decision.
Wednesday, commodity-based currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars jumped
higher, bouncing off a 1.6% rise in the price of a barrel of oil, which followed overnight data indicating global
growth.
As gold and oil rallied, the Australian dollar reached US$0.9940, its highest point since the currency was
freely floated in 1983. The New Zealand dollar hit US$0.7637, nearly a one-year high.
"It was a good day for risk," said Mike Moran, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Standard Chartered Bank
in New York. "You are seeing a big push as we move toward November, with the midterm elections and
[Group of 20] meetings -- as well as the Federal Reserve -- capable of providing legitimate sources of
uncertainty."
Late Wednesday in New York, the euro was at $1.3957, from $1.3916 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 81.77
yen from 81.85 yen, while the euro was at 114.12 yen from 113.91 yen. The pound was at $1.5892 from
$1.5800. The dollar was at 0.9594 Swiss francs from 0.9569 francs.

Central Bankers' Moving Targets

Central Bankers' Moving Targets

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
What exactly are central banks targeting these days?
The old orthodoxy held that the primary focus of monetary policy should be fighting inflation. But some
leading central banks appear actively to be trying to create inflation as a way of boosting nominal GDP
growth, and easing the deleveraging process in countries weighed down by high public- and private-sector
debt burdens. That has profound consequences for investors weighing the balance between bonds and
equities.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is leaning toward more quantitative easing even though it sees only small odds of
deflation. And the minutes of the last Fed meeting note that one strategy for affecting inflation expectations
might be to target nominal GDP growth.
With real growth sluggish, the Fed would hope to boost the nominal number with higher inflation. U.S.
nominal GDP is now only 3.7% above its trough, whereas a normal recovery would have seen it up 10% by
this point, Deutsche Bank points out.
In the U.K., where policy remains very loose despite inflation persistently above 3%, there also is talk of
more quantitative easing, prompting Goldman Sachs to speculate on whether the Bank of England is
pursuing a covert policy of nominal GDP targeting. Nominal GDP grew 5.7% in the year to June. Indeed,
deputy governor Charles Bean gave an admiring lecture three years ago on the merits of nominal GDP
targeting. The European Central Bank looks almost isolated in its attachment to inflation-fighting and
distaste for quantitative easing.
Of course, quantitative easing mightn't succeed in triggering core price inflation, at least in the short term.
The impact may be simply to inflate the price of financial-sector assets and commodities, rather than driving
activity in the real economy. Over time, policy makers seem to hope that asset-price inflation will boost
confidence and encourage risk-taking. They ultimately have the power to generate inflation if they choose
and seem willing to err on the side of doing too much rather than too little.
The policy carries huge risks. But price rises for gold and inflation-linked bonds suggest a return to inflation
is starting to be baked in. Tipping the balance toward inflation should boost the allure of equities over bonds
with fixed coupons. And yet, so far, flows into bonds have shown little sign of slowing: U.S. equity mutual
funds saw $19 billion of outflows in September, while bond funds saw $32 billion of inflows, data from the
Investment Company Institute show.
Long-dated U.S. Treasury investors can salivate at the prospect of the price-insensitive Fed increasing its
purchases, even with yields already at rock-bottom levels. But if the central bank does succeed in juicing
inflation, anybody left holding the bonds is in for a rude awakening.

NEW YORK -- The Treasury market rallied as investors took heart from the Federal Reserve's announcement
to buy $32 billion in government bonds in the next few weeks.
Late afternoon, the benchmark 10-year note was 4/32 higher to yield 2.431%. The two-year note was
unchanged, yielding 0.367%. Bond prices move inversely to yields. Bonds fell earlier on a rally in stocks and
a lukewarm sale of $21 billion in 10-year notes.
Buyers returned in the afternoon session as the size of the Fed's purchase plan exceeded the forecast of $26
billion to $29 billion by many market participants.
"It may be a signal from the Fed that they will be aggressive with government debt purchases," said Michael
Franzese, head of Treasury trading at Wunderlich Securities.
Investors are bracing for the $13 billion 30-year bond auction Thursday, the last leg of this week's sale of $66
billion in new government debt supply.
The 30-year bond was the only loser, with its prices down 3/32 to yield 3.824%. The bond has
underperformed in recent days on speculation that the Fed may concentrate its debt buying in shorter-dated
Treasurys.
Many investors also dumped the 30-year bond on worries that the Fed's monetary stimulus may generate
inflation in the longer term. The longer the maturity, the more the bond's value falls when consumer prices
rise.
Two favorite inflation-hedge assets have seen strong demand. Gold hit a record high of $1,375.70 an ounce
Wednesday and Treasury inflation-protected securities extended their rally.
A gauge of inflation expectation in the TIPS market has risen. The 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread
between 10-year TIPS and 10-year conventional Treasurys, rose to 2.04 percentage points Wednesday, the
first time the gap broke the 2.00-percentage-point level since June.

U.S. stocks eked out a slim gain, after minutes from a September meeting of the Federal Reserve increased
confidence that the central bank will take further action to stimulate the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10.06 points, or 0.1% to close at 11020.4. The Nasdaq Composite
added 15.59 points, or 0.7% to 2417.92, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 4.45 points, or
0.4% to 1169.77.
After a morning in the red, stocks turned positive Tuesday after minutes from the central bank's September
meeting showed officials' discussions focused on buying more Treasurys or on new strategies for inflation if
prices remained too low and unemployment too high. The minutes also disclosed that the Fed's staff cut the
projections for economic growth in 2011 and expected the underlying inflation rate, already below the
central bank's informal objective, to slow further next year.
"What the Fed said today didn't surprise anybody," said Bill Vaughn, portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth
Management. "Most people thought the comments were going to lay the groundwork for quantitative easing,
and they essentially did that."
Investors have been expecting the Fed to unveil additional stimulus measures at its November meeting,
which has driven the dollar lower and stocks higher in recent weeks.
The dollar had been up earlier in Tuesday's session, but the U.S. currency returned to its recent slump
following the Fed minutes as additional stimulus is expected to lower the value of the dollar. Gold futures
climbed, reversing an earlier decline.
Treasurys fell, with the yield on the 10-year rising to 2.419% as tepid demand on a three-year-note sale
suggested the ultralow yield levels have started to turn some investors away.
Financial and technology companies led the gains in stocks ahead of earnings reports due from Intel and J.P.
Morgan Chase. Before reporting, Intel gained 21 cents, or 1.1% to 19.77. After the close, the chip maker
reported that third-quarter profit climbed 59% and revenue topped $11 billion for the first time. Intel's shares
were higher in after-hours trading.
J.P. Morgan, which will release its report Wednesday, climbed 67 cents, or 1.7%, to 40.40. Meanwhile, Bank
of America led the Dow, gaining 37 cents, or 2.8%, to 13.52.
However, the energy, industrial and materials sectors fell as concerns were reignited over the potential
impact of tightening measures from China. The country's central bank late Sunday moved to temporarily
raise its reserve requirements on six banks in an effort to manage liquidity and cope with inflationary
pressure.
"The worry is that anything that China does might turn their boom into a bust," said Bill Stone, chief
investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management.
Elsewhere, Pfizer edged up 10 cents, or 0.6%, to 17.48, after the drug company said it will buy King
Pharmaceuticals for $3.6 billion. King Pharmaceuticals soared $3.99, or 39%, to 14.14.
Global Payments lost $3.44, or 8.1%, to 38.90, after the payments processor said its fiscal first-quarter
earnings fell 15% and its core profit unexpectedly slid despite a moderate revenue climb.
Digital-identity assurance firm ActivIdentity gained 97 cents, or 43%, to 3.23, after Swedish lock maker Assa
Abloy said it entered into an agreement to buy the company in a deal valued at $162 million.

Corrections & Amplifications
Iran's Central Bank released inflation data in April 2010 but hasn't released an economic annual report for
three years. A Tuesday World News article incorrectly said the central bank hasn't released official gross
domestic product, inflation and other data for three years.
(WSJ October 16, 2010)
(END)
Iran's economy is under increasing strain four months after the latest international sanctions against Tehran,
say Iranian businessmen, traders and consumers, who describe spreading pain from inflation, joblessness
and mounting shortages.
In interviews from within Iran, these people paint a picture of unsteady supply chains and disrupted exports.
Ordinary Iranians say they worry they will be caught paying more for goods and services even as the
government trims subsidies.
Iran's central bank hasn't released official gross domestic product, inflation and other data for three years.
But anecdotally, these Iranians say, weaknesses in their economy appear to have been magnified since
June, when the United Nations, European Union and U.S. began stepping up measures aimed at deterring
Tehran's nuclear program.
"Every morning, we go to work wondering how we will manage the day," says Gholam Hossein, a Tehran
brick-factory owner. "The market is chaotic and unpredictable. One day we can't move our goods from the
port. Another day we can't open a letter of credit."
An industrial-machinery importer says operating costs have risen at least 30% because of new shipping and
insurance restrictions on Iran-bound cargo, costs to be passed on to consumers. A retired accountant in
Tehran says her pension is stretched thin. "Inflation is putting a lot of pressure on people," she says. "It's on
everyone's minds."
The sanctions are an attempt to force Iran to reconsider its nuclear ambitions -- which Tehran says are
peaceful, but the U.S. and others say are directed toward weapons production. The measures have brought
new scrutiny to shipping and financial transactions. Some foreign firms have suspended or limited their
transactions with Iran.
Layoffs and worker strikes at state companies have been rarities in Iran. But a pharmaceutical company
owner said he recently curbed production and laid off at least 40 employees because of the increasing time
and cost of importing raw materials. Iran's ILNA news agency, meanwhile, reported that last week workers
walked off the job at government-owned factories -- two tire plants and a cooking-oil maker -- saying they
hadn't been paid in as long as four months.
"The economic crisis we are witnessing today is a direct result of the sanctions -- and Iranian officials who say
otherwise are fooling themselves," said Mojtaba Vahidi, who served as a top-level manager for nearly two
decades in Iran's ministries of finance and industry. Mr. Vahidi was an economic adviser to a candidate in last
year's Iranian presidential elections and now lives in the U.S.
It is still too early to say whether new international measures will force the intended concessions. Iran has
sizable hard-currency reserves to absorb shocks, and the isolation of its banking sector protected the country
from the worst of the global financial crisis.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told reporters in New York recently that the economy is healthy. He
and other Iranian officials say Iran is adept at surviving sanctions and that the new measures will only make
the country more self-sufficient.
But at least one emergency measure imposed by Tehran to limit the impact of its growing isolation has
instead magnified the problem. Iran -- which is oil-rich but is nonetheless a net importer of gasoline -- said it
would reconfigure its petrochemical plants to make gasoline after Washington targeted foreign supplies of the
fuel in July.
Afshin Nourshahi, production manager of a privately owned industrial paint maker west of Tehran, said that in
the past few weeks it has become difficult to buy chemical-based raw materials that are also used gasoline
production. He has decreased production. "We are waiting to see if we can survive the crisis or we will be
forced to close in the next few months," he said.
Eisah Gharibi Kalbir, chairman of Iran's plastic-industry union, which represents private businesses and
hundreds of thousands of workers in negotiations with the government, said he expects prices of plastic items
such as water bottles to double over the next few months because of the shortfall of raw materials.
While Iran's troubles appear to have been exacerbated by sanctions, much can also be traced to government
economic policy. President Ahmadinejad, in his first term, spent lavishly and eased credit as part of a series
of populist programs. Since then, lower oil prices have made such programs less sustainable.
The International Monetary Fund forecasts Iran's economy will grow 1.6% this year, from 1.1% in 2009 and
1% in 2008 and 7.8% in 2007.
As part of its efforts to rebalance the economy, the government has in the past year proposed income-tax
increases on traders in gold, steel, fabrics and other sectors, prompting several work stoppages by
merchants. For more than two weeks, gold traders in Tehran and 12 other cities have been on strike, seeking
to negotiate lower taxes.
Merchants say higher levies will exacerbate inflation that is already crimping consumers' purchasing power.
"We deal with people every day and know they are suffering," says one merchant in Tehran.
The government is also considering cutting food and fuel subsidies, which could bring greater pain. A
household of four now typically receives nearly $4,000 a year in government gas, oil and electricity subsidies,
according to the IMF. Mr. Ahmadinejad fought for legislation, passed in January, to gradually phase out those
subsidies and save about $100 billion a year.
Cuts that were set to take effect Sept. 23 but have since been delayed are expected to boost prices of
subsidized items such as wheat, rice, oil, milk and sugar. On Thursday, the government said it would deploy
a task force to talk to merchants and consumers about how to introduce the plan with minimal pain.
Iran says it has brought inflation from above 25% in 2008 -- a time of regionwide overheating due to soaring
oil prices -- to under 10% this year.
The IMF, too, estimates inflation is now about 10%, but warns that the subsidy cuts could send the rate to
30%.
Some economists and analysts, including Mr. Vahidi, say inflation is already over 25%, which the
government rejects.
Some regime insiders, including former president Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, have warned the
regime not to play down the impact of sanctions. Mr. Rafsanjani, a bitter rival of Mr. Ahmadinejad, remains a
powerful force in Tehran's conservative clerical leadership.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 24 points in screen trade.
Sentiment in Asia got a boost from Wall Street's rise on Friday, with a weak U.S. payrolls report increasing
expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve to announce fresh measures to kick start an ailing U.S. economy.
"In this [weak U.S. economy] setting, we now believe the Fed will formally announce a second round of
quantitative easing," UBS said in a note to clients.
In SYDNEY, Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 rose to a five-month high at 4713.2 as miners led a
broad-based rise.

billion bank facility it hopes will drive already outlined expansion plans. Among other miners, BHP Billiton
advanced 0.8% and Rio Tinto added 1.1% after copper prices rose sharply on Friday. Newcrest Mining rose
1.9% on another solid gain in gold prices.
Banking stocks were also higher, with ANZ Bank 0.8% up and Westpac up 0.4%.
In SEOUL, foreign buying helped the market higher, led by automakers and steel stocks.
Hyundai Motor advanced 1.3%, Posco rose 1.0% and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering added
1.9%. Samsung Electronics, which provided weak-than-expected third quarter guidance last week, continued
to encounter selling pressure; the stock was off 0.1%.
In WELLINGTON, New Zealand shares were drifting higher in subdued activity.
Coal miner Pike River Coal rose 4.5% after it said it had completed the installation of its hydro-monitor
system.
