European markets slid again, with a leading index briefly hitting a level not seen for more than 12 years, as oil
producers and food producers moved lower.
Most Asian markets also fell Tuesday, and the losses continued into early Wednesday trading, with Japan
down 0.8% at midday.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index Tuesday fell 1.8% to 161.34, resuming Monday's downward
trend, when stocks fell 5%. Although stocks bounced back a bit in early trading in Europe they couldn't hold
on to gains and the Stoxx 600 quickly fell to levels not seen since late 1996.
"The move to the upside was technical after the 5% we lost yesterday. The selling pressure remains
extremely high. All the problems are still on the table with the financial sector, the bad economic news, the
bad corporate news," said Philippe Gijsels, a strategist at Fortis Bank.
In LONDON, the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 index lost 3.1% to 3512.09. BP shares were down 4.3% after
Monday's slump in oil prices. The oil giant also steered an estimate for longer-term production lower and
outlined plans to spend less on refining and alternative energy while still maintaining spending in exploration
and production. Royal Dutch Shell shares fell 5.4%.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 dropped 1% to 2554.55. Shares of energy firm Total fell 2.2%. In the telecom sector,
shares of equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent slumped 6.3%. Standard &Poor's cut its long-term corporate credit
rating on the firm to single-B-plus from double-B-minus.
In FRANKFURT, the DAX 30 index fell 0.5% to 3690.72. Shares in drug maker Bayer dropped 0.8%. The firm
lowered its 2009 outlook because of flagging demand for the plastics produced by its chemicals division.
Fourth-quarter net income rose 58% after a year-earlier tax hit, with sales down 1.5%.
Earlier in the day, most Asian markets fell, but the declines weren't as big as those on Wall Street overnight.
"The markets have been oversold. . . . Normally, regional markets run ahead of Wall Street, and they already
slumped yesterday," said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer at KGI Asia.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies ended down 0.7% at 7229.72, holding above the
psychologically important 7000 level. Financial companies lost ground, with Mizuho Financial Group losing
2.8% and Shinsei Bank shedding 3.5%. UBS pointed out that the more the Nikkei 225 falls, the more likely
Japanese banks are to have to raise capital.
In SYDNEY, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 1% to 3219.20, recovering much of the ground lost earlier in the day after
the central bank left interest rates unchanged. Resources stocks were mostly lower, with BHP Billiton losing
2.4% and Japan's Inpex falling 5.8% among energy producers. Lihir Gold fell 5.7%.
In HONG KONG, the benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 2.3% lower at 12033.88, dragged down by HSBC
Holdings a day after the bank reported a 70% drop in profit and said it will raise capital by selling shares to
existing shareholders. HSBC plunged 19%.
In MEXICO CITY, stocks rose in a volatile session, helped by a rally in Cemex and Grupo Mexico shares.
The IPC stock index rose 1% to 17093.25. General strength in copper prices helped miner Grupo Mexico,
which leapt 7.5%. Cement maker Cemex rose 6.5%.

Exchange-traded funds offer a way to diversify a portfolio beyond what's available in a company
401(k) plan

Looking for a more varied investment diet than your 401(k) plan's menu can provide?
Some financial advisers are recommending exchange-traded funds outside clients' corporate retirement plans
as a low-cost way to round out people's investment portfolios.
Most 401(k) plans offer a lineup of mutual funds focused on U.S. stocks and bonds and international stocks
from developed markets. Advisers commonly urge investors to diversify their holdings beyond those
categories, to help soften the blow when stocks go south and to smooth out a portfolio's performance over the
long haul. Many, for instance, suggest that investors devote 5% to 10% of their portfolio to gold or
commodities -- sectors that tend to zig when stocks zag.
But those aren't options in many company plans. "Many investors are handcuffed by limited choices in their
401(k) plans," says Matt McCall, president of investment adviser Penn Financial Group LLC in Ridgewood,
N.J. They need to look elsewhere for alternatives.
ETFs are an attractive option, some advisers say, for two broad reasons, among others: Unlike individual
stocks or bonds, ETFs can be used to track entire market sectors, like commodities or real estate. And they
give investors greater flexibility than mutual funds, because they trade all day on exchanges.
That doesn't mean, of course, that ETFs will always be the right choice. Some, for instance, are more
expensive than certain mutual funds when all fees are considered, and active trading of ETFs can be costly.
In other cases, a given mutual fund might simply be a better fit for an investor's portfolio. But there are ETFs
available to suit a wide range of investment goals.
At the end of 2008, there were 728 ETFs holding $531.3 billion in total assets, according to the Investment
Company Institute, the main trade group for the mutual-fund business. Although overall assets have shrunk
during the financial markets' swoon, ETFs had net inflows of $177.2 billion last year, while stock mutual funds
had net outflows of $234.3 billion, according to the institute.
The ability to trade ETFs all day on an exchange has made them especially attractive in the current
financial-markets crisis, with prices sometimes fluctuating wildly within a single day. So has their transparency
-- ETFs disclose their holdings daily. And amid the market wreckage, many investors are playing it safe by
turning to relatively low-cost, index-tracking investments, like most ETFs, rather than trusting
more-expensive, actively managed mutual funds to outperform the markets.
Also, some ETFs give investors the ability to hedge their portfolios, notes Tom Anderson, head of strategy
and research in the intermediary business group at State Street Global Advisors, a unit of State Street Corp.
and a major ETF sponsor. These so-called inverse ETFs are designed to deliver the opposite of a market
benchmark's performance. So, for instance, an inverse ETF that moves counter to an index of overseas
stocks could help limit the damage to a portfolio with significant investments in declining foreign shares.
Mr. Anderson notes that ETFs also have tax advantages that have come into play in the markets' steep slide.
When mutual funds face heavy redemptions by investors, as they have in recent months, they have to sell
some of their holdings to pay the investors who are pulling out. In some cases, they have had to sell assets
they've held for a long time, so they've registered capital gains on those sales. And those capital gains have
to be distributed among the mutual funds' investors, who may be hit with a tax bill as a result. By contrast,
investors who want out of an ETF sell their shares to other investors on an exchange, realizing their own
capital gains or losses. In most cases, there's no need for the fund to sell assets to cover redemptions, so no
capital gains are generated for the shareholders who remain in the ETF.

Underscoring the fear in financial markets and worries over the U.S. dollar, SPDR Gold Shares passed
several key milestones in February as investors piled into the perceived safety of the precious metal. In late
February the fund exceeded $30 billion in assets, making it the second-largest ETF. Also in February, the
amount of gold held by the fund surpassed 1,000 metric tons for the first time.
The gold ETF is down slightly over the past year, but up more than 18% a year on average over the past
three years, according to Morningstar. Investors can also play the gold angle with ETFs that invest in mining
stocks, such as Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF.
Other ETFs give investors exposure to individual commodities or to a range of commodities. Besides their
value in diversifying a portfolio of stocks and bonds, commodities are considered by market analysts to be a
hedge against inflation.
PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund, with assets of $1.3 billion, is one ETF that tracks a broad
basket of commodities. U.S. Oil Fund, which has $3.5 billion in assets, follows an index of crude-oil futures.
Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund is a $4 billion ETF tied to an index of energy stocks. All three funds staged
sharp rallies in the first half of 2008 but have fallen hard since commodities prices peaked over the summer.
The performance of ETFs that invest in metals and commodities is linked directly to the prices of the physical
materials or related futures contracts. That's different from funds that invest in the stocks of mining and
natural-resources companies. Mining and energy stocks are seen as a leveraged bet on commodities,
because the shares tend to be more volatile than the related commodity prices. Investors in these funds also
are exposed to all the corporate risks that accompany stocks.
Real estate is another common form of diversification that's often unavailable in retirement plans. Real-estate
ETFs include SPDR Dow Jones Wilshire REIT ETF and iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund.
A word of warning: When venturing outside a 401(k), investors should consider the tax implications of the
funds they buy. True, ETFs aren't forced to sell assets to cover redemptions and then distribute any capital
gains to investors, as mutual funds sometimes are. But investors still are subject to capital-gains taxes on
ETF holdings they sell, and those tax rates aren't the same for all types of investments. For instance, says
IndexUniverse.com editor Matt Hougan, some capital gains from commodities ETFs that buy futures can be
taxed at a higher rate than gains from stocks.
Also, commodities funds never take delivery of a commodity, but instead regularly "roll" their holdings of
futures contracts -- selling contracts that are near expiration and replacing them with contracts that expire
later. If the new contracts are more expensive than the ones being replaced, the ETF can lose money on the
swap, eating into any overall gains. So investors shouldn't expect a fund to deliver the same gains they might
see in the spot price of the underlying commodity.
Ideally, investors should put their holdings of the least tax-efficient funds, like those that invest in currencies
or commodities, in tax-deferred accounts whenever possible, keeping stock funds in taxable accounts if
necessary, Mr. Hougan says. For instance, an individual retirement account is a good place to stash a
commodity ETF.
Of course, any time you put money in a taxable account when you haven't maxed out your 401(k)
contributions, you're sacrificing tax deferral.
Investors who buy ETFs or any other assets outside a 401(k) also need to keep in mind that they're
complicating their overall portfolio. That means they'll have to keep a closer watch to make sure the
allocations of various assets don't get too far out of whack due to market moves -- like a surge in gold prices
and a drop in stocks that bumps a gold ETF up to a higher percentage of the portfolio than desired.

Gold Reigns Atop the Great Divide
Goldbugs and their similarly intense brethren, the "peak oilers," appear to have had a falling out.
Their apocalyptic visions of crude shortages and economic and political chaos helped prices of both oil and
gold surge in recent years. Since early November, however, they have diverged, with New York Mercantile
Exchange crude down more than 40%, and gold up by much the same amount.
It is becoming clear that in this particular Armageddon, two things are happening: Governments are printing
money, and people and factories are burning less oil.
Even with oil now below $40 a barrel and gold nudging $1,000 an ounce, this "schism spread" could continue
widening for some time. Gold demand, normally weighted heavily to jewelry, is now driven by investors.
Retail buyers, in particular, lacking easy access to more sophisticated inflation hedges, have piled into gold
exchange-traded funds. UBS metals strategist John Reade points to a collapse in gold leasing rates, the cost
of borrowing gold, since November. That can be interpreted as a positive sign. In particular, speculators that
might be tempted to sell gold short in anticipation of a price fall must contend with a fear that the financial
system will unravel or the cost of government backing for the economy will mean higher inflation further
down the road.
In one respect, that reliance on investment demand should make speculators nervous: Once fear of inflation
subsides, the ETFs' vaults might empty quickly. Inflows have slowed this week. That could prove temporary,
however. The amount of money invested in gold ETFs is a fraction of the trillions lying in U.S. money-market
funds. A small switcht would underpin further increases in prices.
As a dollar-denominated commodity, oil also ought to do well as the Federal Reserve prepares to flood the
system with money. Against that, however, retail investors, having seen the oil price drop precipitously, will
tend to choose yellow gold over the black variety.
Unlike gold, oil's transformation into a popular asset class is a relatively recent phenomenon. Its price is
ultimately tied to how much we are burning.
On that front, there is little to cheer energy bulls. The International Energy Agency now expects global oil
demand to drop a total of 1.5% across 2008 and 2009. That would be the first two-year decline since the
early 1980s. But in terms of magnitude, it would be closer to the recession of the early 1990s.
Given the seriousness of the current recession, the impact on energy demand probably will be deeper and
longer lasting than the IEA envisions.
Where the current economic downturn bottoms out is anyone's guess, but it is clear governments want to
print their way out of it. Such crude logic favors gold.

Global Investors Lose Yen for Safety
Call it a lucky break for Japan or proof that markets eventually tend to correct themselves. Either way, the yen
has suddenly started to shed its haven status.
Since 2007, the yen has been a reliable gauge of risk aversion, as Japanese investors sold assets
denominated in depreciating foreign currencies -- stocks, bonds, real estate -- and brought funds home.
Foreign assets held by Japanese investment trusts have fallen $118 billion in the past year.
In this way, the yen has been a particularly acute measure of panic, spiking as investors dumped stocks and
emerging-market currencies.
That correlation has now broken down. Stocks are again tumbling, and the U.S. stock market's fear gauge,
the VIX, has jumped to a one-month high. But the yen has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in 12
weeks.
The yen still is up 15% against the dollar over six months. But it is backing off those gains quickly. After all,
grim as the outlook is for the U.S., it is only worse for Japan. The country lacks credible political leadership,
and its economy is shrinking at its fastest rate since 1974.
There is one silver lining: The falling yen is welcome relief for Japanese exporters and for the government,
which has struggled with the temptation to intervene and weaken the currency.
In January, exports fell a record 46%. More dismal economic news, when Japan reports a slew of data
Friday, could see the yen falling further.
But at least some in Japan would find consolation in that.

Wells's Misplaced Generosity
Wells Fargo looks even farther out on a limb. J.P. Morgan Chase said Monday that it was cutting its dividend.
Wells, having proudly raised its dividend in the third quarter of last year, might be reluctant to follow.
It should.
Wells's stock yields over 10%. Dividends, which cost $4.31 billion last year, deplete capital. Wells's ratios are
hardly impressive as it is, and look anything but bulletproof in the face of rising credit losses and huge
economic uncertainty.
First, at 7.9%, the bank's Tier 1 capital ratio is well below that of its peers. J.P. Morgan's is 10.9%, for
instance. Indeed, without the government's $25 billion capital injection last fall, Wells's Tier 1 ratio could be
under 6% -- the level required for regulators to consider a bank well-capitalized.
As a result, it makes sense to conserve as much of that $25 billion taxpayer injection as possible, something
the Treasury might push for.
Of course, dividends also eat into tangible common equity, or TCE, a more conservative capital measure.
Unlike other banks, Wells doesn't disclose TCE, but it is estimated to be just over $34 billion, or 2.68% of
tangible assets. J.P. Morgan's ratio is 3.8%.
If Wells continues paying 34 cents a quarter in dividends, that would be equivalent to roughly 14% of TCE this
year.
What is Wells waiting for?

In September, AIG imploded just as federal officials were dealing with Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. Then
Monday, just as the government was formulating a rescue plan for Citigroup, there were reports that AIG lost
more than $60 billion in the fourth quarter and needed more taxpayer help.
AIG's need is huge: The government already has put up $150 billion. This reduces the amount available to
throw at the wider financial sector. It also undermines political support for the administration's strategy of
ensuring that financial firms' counterparties and creditors are repaid in full. If that support crumbles, investors
will question whether the government really has the will to apply it to all the institutions it ends up controlling.
The cost of using credit-default swaps to protect against an AIG default nearly doubled Monday, as news of
the expected fourth-quarter loss came out.
Granted, the authorities have no stomach for forcing losses on AIG's trading counterparties and creditors,
even though doing so could cut the cost of AIG's bailout. It is now accepted wisdom that hurting Lehman's
creditors deepened the credit crisis.
But AIG has demonstrated how tough it is to estimate the scale of losses that financial institutions are
capable of generating. That could color the government's thinking as it decides how to deal with Citigroup or
Bank of America. If the numbers become unpalatable, investors shouldn't assume that the government can
write blank checks forever.

Chile Proves Haven for Defensive-Minded --- Market Up 7% in '09 as Country's Stability Draws

Global investor skittishness is proving a boon to Latin America's most stable and conservatively managed
economy, Chile.
Chilean stocks, snubbed in recent years for those of its jazzier neighbors like Brazil or Colombia, are enjoying
a contrarian rally this year -- one of the few markets on the upside. That is because the country's conservative
long-term macroeconomic policy is now a good fit for fund managers who have been forced by the credit
crisis to invest more conservatively.
Though Chilean stocks tracked U.S. declines Monday, the 40-share blue-chip Ipsa index ended at 2543.96,
up 7% on the year. That is a standout result, even in a region that has so far mostly defied the recent carnage
brought on elsewhere by a revival of financial-sector fears.
"I think the need for defense is playing a role here," said Citi Latin America stock strategist Geoffrey Dennis of
Chile's outperformance.
Mr. Dennis cites the $25 billion that the government has squirreled away in its economic and social
stabilization fund, which represents about 14% of the country's gross domestic product. Such reserves give
the country "a tremendous scope" to cut interest rates and expand its fiscal policy, he said.
Another reason to like Chile lies in the diversity of its market, says Nudgem Richyal, international fund
manager for J O Hambro Capital Management in London. Even though copper dominates the economy,
Chile's stock market is "not just a play on copper prices," said Mr. Richyal, who especially likes the retail
sector.
Citing companies such as Banco Santander Chile, retail holding company Cencosud, and fertilizer and
chemicals maker Sociedad Quimica, Mr. Richyal notes that the Chilean stock market "is a bit more
variegated."
Nonetheless, the country's dependence on copper for export and fiscal revenue looms as an Achilles' heel for
the local stock market, much as Peru's market has been hostage to precious-metals prices.
The good news is that for now copper prices have been relatively stable, showing greater resilience than
those of other metals. Although copper prices on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange
are now at less than half the high of around $4 a pound in the first half of 2008, they have held within a tight
range.
In fact, the biggest problem could be that Chilean stocks have done too well, pricing themselves out of
competition with their potentially more interesting peers. "It's quite an expensive market, and not very liquid,"
said Julian Thompson, a London-based fund manager at Threadneedle Emerging Market Fund.
The average 2009 price-to-earnings ratio for Chilean stocks hovers around 15 times, almost double the eight
times ratio at which Brazilian stocks are trading and well above Mexico's current-year P/E of around 10.
"That's a pretty healthy premium" to pay, said Mr. Thompson, who has invested just 1% of his $2 billion fund
in Chile, keeping the bulk of his portfolio in Chinese and Brazilian stocks.
Asian Markets Swoon
In Early Tuesday Trading

Markets in Asia tumbled in early trading Tuesday, with Hong Kong's benchmark down nearly 3.6%, Seoul
3.3% lower and Tokyo down 2.6% after recession fears drove Wall Street to its worst finish in more than a
decade. Every major market shuddered from losses across a range of sectors.
Markets in the region were mixed Monday, with Tokyo bouncing off its lows and Seoul and Sydney logging
gains. India's market was closed for a holiday .
In TOKYO Monday, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies dropped as much as 2.8% in early trading as
a bankruptcy filing by nonbank lender SFCG soured sentiment. But the index retraced most of its losses to
end 0.5% lower at 7376.16. Japanese nonbank lenders were hurt by the SFCG news, with Takefuji down
16% and Orix down 13%. SFCG tumbled 15% on top of its 49% slump over the previous nine sessions.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index surged 3.8% to 13175.10, spurred by financials. HSBC Holdings rose
0.9%, bouncing off the day's early lows. Among Chinese companies, China Construction Bank jumped 5.3%
and China Life Insurance rallied 5.2%. China's Real Gold Mining, making its trading debut in Hong Kong,
advanced nearly 14% from its initial-public-offering price before giving up all those gains to finish unchanged.
Later in the day, a rebound in European markets faded as the technology and auto sectors came under
pressure. The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 fell 0.9% to 175.29.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index lost 1% to 3850.73 as oil producers weighed. Royal Dutch Shell fell 2.3%
and BP declined 2%. Barclays Capital said that BP and Shell are its key underweights in the large-cap
European oil sector, noting 30% outperformance over the past 12 months. Royal Bank of Scotland Group
jumped 9.8% on its plans to split itself up.
In FRANKFURT, the DAX 30 fell 2% to 3936.45. Infineon Technologies lost 12% as the company's
memory-chip unit, Qimonda, filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 declined 0.8% to 2727.87. telecom-equipment provider Alcatel-Lucent fell 7.1%, and
auto makers Renault and Peugeot declined 10.8% and 4.3%, respectively.
In DUBAI, stocks moved higher after the emirate's government launched a $20 billion bond program. The
news allayed some fears that Dubai and government-owned companies would struggle to refinance debt
obligations this year. The Dubai Financial Market, or DFM, jumped 7.9% to 1652.98; the DFM shed 72% of its
value last year.

Property Frights: GE Capital Punishment
General Electric hasn't kept pace with the plunging banks. But its shares have still dived more than 42% this
year on doubts over its finance subsidiary. A trawl through GE Capital's balance sheet shows why investors
should remain wary.
On the surface, the unit looks enviably positioned. It retains a triple-A rating, has no meaningful exposure to
U.S. residential mortgages and enjoys one of the highest tangible-common-equity ratios in the financial sector
-- a meaty 4.9% at the end of last year, against, for instance, J.P. Morgan Chase's 3.8%.
Dig a little deeper, however, and the uncertainty mounts. One reason: GE Capital has large concentrations of
other real-estate assets -- commercial exposures and foreign residential mortgages -- that could lead to large
losses in a deep recession. Another: Despite some changes, GE Capital still looks like a classic "wholesale"
finance company, relying on market funding. This is a drawback when credit markets are skittish and large
amounts of long-term debt -- $133 billion this year and next -- are coming due.
On the asset side, a big source of jitters is GE Capital's $36.7 billion in commercial-real-estate investments.
These are equity-type investments, the first to absorb any losses. As a result, most firms are currently
applying big haircuts to this type of asset.
In its fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs Group, using mark-to-market accounting, took a 25% writedown, totaling
$961 million, on its commercial-real-estate equity investments. GE Capital, which values its holdings using
estimates of future cash flows rather than marking them to market, took $300 million of impairments last year,
equivalent to less than 1% of the equity investments.
That is even more surprising given that GE has booked sizable unrealized losses on its book of securities
backed by commercial real estate, which the company does mark to market. These bonds, senior to equity in
the investments they fund, are written down by 23%. Admittedly, they are in different deals from GE's equity
investments. But the huge divergence in the accounting hits understandably rings alarm bells with investors.
In GE's defense: Marks on the debt securities may be exaggerated by extreme stress in the market for such
securities. Second, unlike some other investors, GE operates most of the properties in which it has equity-like
investments, arguably giving them a higher value. Also, in the vast majority of the equity deals, GE itself
provided the debt funding -- not third-party investors -- meaning there could be less immediate refinancing
risk to the individual deals. Finally, GE does flag the risks by disclosing in its annual report that its real-estate
equity investments'"estimated value" is $4 billion less than the value on the balance sheet.
But since GE was a big commercial-real-estate equity investor in the frothy years -- it added $12.6 billion of
these assets in 2007 alone -- investors should watch this portfolio very closely.
Attention should also be paid to GE Capital's $59.6 billion of overseas residential mortgages, many of which
are based in troubled markets like the U.K. Some $3.3 billion of these mortgages are more than 90-days
past-due, but GE Capital's loan-loss reserve is equivalent to only 11.5% of the past-due total, up only slightly
from 10% at the end of 2007.
Cross-bank comparisons should be treated warily because of differences in loan-portfolios. But, for example,
Bank of America's reserve for residential mortgages in the U.S. is far higher at just under 20% of
nonperforming residential assets.
The need to clear up uncertainties about future credit losses at GE Capital is key, not just for stock investors
and creditors, but also for the ratings firms. Going by GE's credit-default-swap spreads, the market expects
the triple-A rating to go. How much lower depends on how many losses are lurking in the balance sheet --
and the amount credit markets will charge to keep supporting wholesale-funded businesses.

Braced for a Shanghai Stock Surprise
China has an uncommon liquidity problem. It has got too much.
Having ordered Chinese banks to ramp up lending in recent months, Beijing is now taking steps to pull funds
out of the banking system. The spur, many think, is that rather than making economically useful investments,
Chinese companies are using borrowings to take a flier on stocks.
Any evidence is circumstantial, for now. But it certainly has precedent. As China's stock-market bubble
inflated in 2007, investment income accounted for as much as a quarter of China Inc.'s profits, including for
companies with little ostensible reason to be investing.
The money is certainly flowing into the stock market. Last Monday, as the Shanghai Composite Index
advanced to its highest close since August, turnover on the Shanghai Stock Exchange reached its highest
level since last April. The index is up 24% this year.
Regulators are looking into where all the new loans are winding up. The central bank has been selling
treasury bills more frequently to draw excess cash out of the banking system.
The problem isn't just that the speculative investing could put banks' assets at risk if the market falls. It's that
the run-up in stock prices is luring in others. Last week, nearly 426,000 new individual trading accounts were
opened, says China Securities Depository &Clearing Corp., a sharp increase over recent levels.
Any buying now could be the ultimate suckers' play. If companies are speculating on stocks again, they could
be out of the market just as quickly as they got in.

Investors Decide: In Gold We Trust
Call it the GLD rush.
As the financial system teeters, investors have fled to gold as a haven. Exchange-traded funds have made it
easy. ETFs such as SPDR Gold Shares -- ticker GLD -- are a direct bet on bullion prices. The trusts have to
buy physical gold to match investment levels. Having doubled the gold in their vaults in a year, the stash is
worth $45 billion.
That's tiny in the context of big asset classes like stocks. But gold's scarcity keeps the market small. If ETFs
continue to grow fast, they could start to create a real squeeze in gold, with its limited supply.
Trusts have added 306 metric tons of gold to their vaults in the first seven weeks of the year, says Barclays
Capital Analyst Suki Cooper. That's just short of the 322 tons added in all of 2008. If that rate were to
continue, this year's ETF purchases would surpass the 2,120 tons procured for jewelry in 2008, replacing it as
the top source of demand.
Lately, gold ETFs haven't blinked in the face of typical obstacles. The dollar has gained nearly 9% against
the euro this year, normally a cue for gold to weaken. But the metal has gained 13%. Ultralow inflation in
most countries would also be negative for gold normally. But some investors are betting on a return to
inflation as governments try reflating their economies. Others are hedging the risk of financial collapse.
Either way, individual investors and hedge funds are making room for gold in their portfolios. ETFs make the
task easier. They are freely tradable, and cheaper to own than it would cost for an individual to locate and
secure the physical commodity. UBS reckons gold coins command a 10% convenience premium.
Barring a sudden improvement in financial markets, investor fear should preserve gold's allure -- even though
unlike other assets, it generates no yield.
But ETFs won't always be a friend to gold, by underpinning physical demand. If, and when, investors decide
the game is up, ETFs will have to liquidate holdings as people sell. Just as they are squeezing the market
now, they could flood it when the frenzy ends.

natural that Howard Stringer -- the Sony boss, usually based in New York -- would want to spend an

But Japanese companies have a way of avoiding real restructuring by transferring workers to zombie

Gold's 'Perfect Storm' Rages On --- Experts See a Rise to $2,000 as Investors Seek Safe Haven

Gold's eight-year bull market may have at least a few more years to run and could carry the precious metal
beyond an inflation-adjusted record north of $2,000 an ounce, managers of precious-metals and
natural-resource mutual funds say.
Friday, gold for February delivery rose $25.70, or 2.6%, to $1001.80, the highest settlement for a front-month
contract since March 18, when it closed at a record $1003.20. Prices surged 6.4% for the week.
"We don't see this being near an end at all," said Brian Hicks, co-manager of U.S. Global Investors' Global
Resources Fund, which invests in gold and other commodities. "In fact, I would classify what is taking place
right now as a 'perfect storm' for gold."
Many investors are diversifying away from financial assets and into gold because of uncertainty about the
global economy and banking sector, he said.
"We think this definitely could be a trend that continues," he said. "The bull market we're seeing could go
much higher than people expect, given what's happening in the financial sector."
To understand today's strong interest in gold, investors only need to read newspaper headlines, rather than
study more fundamental supply and demand considerations such as jewelry demand during the Indian
wedding season or mining output, said John Hathaway, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Gold Fund.
"It all comes down to what bothers investors," he said. "They don't feel they can safely place their money into
financial assets. So they look for other places to go, and gold is one of the things that usually come to the top
of the list."
He suggested the length of the rally will hinge on how long the macroeconomic uncertainty and the low
returns on other investments continue.
"I don't think it's speculative," he said. "It's genuine concern about everything from the crumbling of the
financial system to the political landscape in the U.S. and economies around the world in the free fall."
Mark Johnson, portfolio manager of USAA Precious Metals &Minerals Fund, figures the spot price of gold will
"blow through" the March intraday peak of $1,032.70. Tocqueville's Mr. Hathaway suggested the price of
gold conceivably could hit a "multiples of a thousand," although this might be a couple of years away.
Gold would have to climb to around $2,200 to $2,300 to break the 1980 record, after adjusting prices for
inflation.
"Gold lagged the commodity bull market that we saw up until 2008," said Mr. Hicks, the U.S. Global Investors
manager. "So it's not out of the question for gold to rise to its inflation-adjusted high, particularly given the
fact gold is a small market and there are going to be a lot of dollars with people looking to place their money
in tangible assets rather than intangible assets at this point in time."
Tocqeville's Mr. Hathaway said the case for gold is helped limited global supplies of physical metal.
Traditionally, much of the investment demand has been in paper form, such as futures contracts. But in the
last half-year, there has been a "tremendous" increase in the desire to hold physical gold such as coins or
bars, or exchange-traded funds that are backed by physical gold, he said.

Corrections &Amplifications
Jim Delkousis is a partner at law firm DLA Piper. A Feb. 23 page-one article about Dubai's debt problems
incorrectly identified the firm as DLP Piper.
(WSJ March 6, 2009)
(END)
DUBAI -- The United Arab Emirates said Sunday it will spend $10 billion to bail out the once-highflying
emirate of Dubai, whose huge construction and financial-sector expansion plans became a symbol of boom
times, and now of a world-wide downturn.
Dubai financed much of its recent growth with international borrowing, and a big chunk of that debt comes
due this year. The Dubai government said in a statement Sunday it would issue $20 billion in long-term
bonds, and that the first installment of $10 billion was fully subscribed by the U.A.E.'s central bank.
The bond issuance will provide Dubai "with the necessary liquidity to substitute the liquidity that has dried up
globally in the last 12 months and accordingly meet all upcoming financial obligations," the U.A.E. said. The
bond will be unsecured, fixed-rate paper, yielding 4% a year, with a five-year maturity.
Debt analysts and investors have questioned whether Dubai is able to pay back all its loans, especially as the
city's once red-hot property market cools.
It's unclear if the bailout will be enough to keep Dubai from turning into a cityscape of half-finished buildings.
Dubai said last week that a handful of international banks participated in a modest refinancing of one loan, for
$3.8 billion, that was coming due. But they didn't agree to lend much, forcing Dubai's government to step in
and pony up most of the cash.
Analysts have long held out hope that U.A.E. capital Abu Dhabi would come to the rescue if Dubai found itself
in serious trouble. The seven emirates of the U.A.E. are bound together in a longstanding and relatively
stable federation dating to 1971. Abu Dhabi, one of the world's largest oil producers, provides the lion's share
of the federation's spending. Unlike its neighbor, Dubai doesn't have much oil to bolster its finances.
But the emirates also tend to act independently. The ruling families are hereditary monarchs with
sometimes-competing business, political and diplomatic interests. That's led to speculation that Abu Dhabi
would insist on onerous terms in any bailout, such as stakes in some of Dubai's prized companies. But the
package publicly announced late Sunday didn't appear to have any strings attached.
It's uncertain whether Abu Dhabi would be willing to lend Dubai more cash. Though it sits on vast
foreign-exchange reserves and foreign assets snapped up during the oil boom, Abu Dhabi's fortunes have
also faded. Property prices are sagging there, and its sovereign-wealth fund has been stung by some
overseas investments.
Dubai and U.A.E. officials didn't respond to requests for comment.
The cash infusion from the U.A.E. comes as Dubai's once-soaring real-estate market comes crashing down.
Falling prices, some down by 50% or more, have burned speculators who never intended to hold on to
properties in the first place. Sales have plummeted, crimping cash flow for developers -- which are now
scrambling to shed employees, cancel or postpone billions of dollars worth of projects and extend installment
plans to avoid missed payments.
Banks, meanwhile, aren't lending to buyers or to developers.

"Suddenly, the sales stopped, and when [developers] went to the banks, they found there was a credit
freeze," says Saleh Muradweij, a director at privately held contractor Drake &Skull.
Jim Delkousis, a partner in the Dubai practice of DLP Piper, a business law firm, says the practice has seen a
"significant increase" in debt-collection claims in the construction industry.
Last week, Emaar Properties PJSC, which is one of Dubai's biggest developers and 31% government-owned,
said it will recommend withholding dividends at its annual meeting next month in order to save cash.
The strain is reaching the very top of Dubai's corporate empire. Earlier this month, Dubai Holding, the
conglomerate controlled by Dubai ruler Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum said it would merge its two
investment firms and combine the back offices of three of its property developers to cut costs.
The downturn here is a stunning reversal from just last summer, when oil was above $100 a barrel and the
region looked insulated from the worst of the economic storm gathering over much of the rest of the world.
Dubai was seen as the new economic model for the Middle East, plagued for decades by war and economic
stagnation. Businessmen from many of the region's fallen commercial hubs -- including Cairo, Beirut and
Bahrain -- set up shop here.
The emirate's property market had been rising for years, from 2002, when Sheik Mohammed opened up
certain developments to foreign ownership. That move lured property buyers from across the region, Europe
and the U.S. Prices took off, and so did more construction.
Now, prices are tumbling just as builders complete dozens of office and residential towers, and the glut of
supply looks poised to depress prices further. Cranes loom over dozens of half-finished or just-started
buildings along Sheikh Zayed Road, the eight-lane superhighway that serves as Dubai's main artery.
Last year, builders finished more than 50,000 residential units in Dubai, according to regional bank
EFG-Hermes. An additional 70,000 are expected this year.
"You have these buildings that are finished now, but empty," says Robert Macnair, sales director for
Dubai-based property agent Elysian Real Estate.
Foreign workers -- from professionals to laborers -- are leaving in droves. Basha Abdul Qader, the general
manager of a local debt-collection agency, says he's reclaiming about 20 cars a month, up from seven just a
few months back.
Zahir Safi came to Dubai in the summer of 2006 to wait out a war in his home country of Lebanon. He quickly
found work selling construction supplies, and decided to stay. "There was a lot of opportunity," the
27-year-old says.
The city's property market was in full swing. Nakheel, a government-owned developer, was well into its
construction of the city's iconic palm-shaped island development. Emaar was building the Burj Dubai, which
now stands as the world's tallest skyscraper. Investors rushed to buy into these and other projects. A
secondary market quickly emerged even for half-built or unbuilt properties.
In late 2007, Mr. Safi bought four studios and a one-bedroom apartment from a big, private developer. He put
10% down on each unit. He sold one studio quickly to another investor, pocketing a 25% profit.
In February of last year, Nakheel opened sales for a phase of the Waterfront, a residential, commercial and
tourist development designed to add 500 miles of new beachfront property and house 400,000 people.
Mr. Safi showed up at Nakheel's sales office and put down 10%, or $34,000, on a one-bedroom apartment.
He agreed to pay the full $340,000 price tag in installments.
Investing in property was seen to be so safe "it was like buying gold or diamonds," he says.
Average prices for villas and apartments rose 65% in the first half of last year, according to property
consultant Colliers International. By mid-summer, Mr. Safi had sunk $200,000 into deposits, fees and down
payments on a handful of properties across Dubai. He owed another $1.1 million in future payments.
But clouds were gathering. Real-estate regulators tried to crack down on speculators, who they feared had
taken over the market. Authorities started investigating and locking up executives at some of Dubai's biggest
real-estate and finance companies, spooking investors. When international credit markets seized up in the
fall, banks in Dubai stopped lending, too.

By November, advertised prices were falling, a first since Dubai opened its market to foreigners. By the end
of last year, Colliers reported average prices had fallen 8% in the final quarter of the year. The city's most
expensive real-estate -- which rose the fastest in the boom -- dropped much further.
A 750-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment near the Burj Dubai tower listed last summer for about $685,000.
Now, it's on the market for less than half that.
Dubai officials announced that developers, both government-backed and privately owned, would throttle back
supply to cope.
Mr. Safi watched in shock as the value of his property dropped. Now, he's unsure if any of the developers will
go forward. His next payment on the apartment at Nakheel's Waterfront was due in January. But he says the
company offered to extend it next until the summer. He just wants his cash back.

I think I agree with Judy Shelton that we should go back to the gold standard and abandon fiat money, but
I'm not sure about her overall explanation of capitalism ("Capitalism Needs a Sound-Money Foundation,"
op-ed, Feb. 12). I'm willing to accept that inflation is bad, but it does not necessarily follow that "inflation
makes suckers out of savers."
A major fear in the economy is deflation, not inflation. Although I've saved and accumulated a portfolio of
stocks, bonds and cash that I live off of, my income has declined dramatically because of unconscionably low
interest rates. I simply don't understand the underlying mechanics of a supposedly capitalist economy
(setting aside unpleasant concepts such as government bailouts, "too big to fail," etc.) that has allowed this to
happen. In inflationary times, interest rates go up. If I can get a 10% yield on my money in a certificate of
deposit or money-market account, at least I'd be generating a much greater income than I get now, receiving
a percent or two. Yes, I understand that I am "losing" if inflation is higher than 10%, but as long as I live
within my means, it seems that I'm better off than in these deflationary times.
Also, capitalism operates on the principle of supply and demand, which means that a product or service that
is scarce is valued more highly than a product or service that is abundant. I don't understand how money can
be significantly more scarce (i.e., credit markets frozen, no lending), but declining in value, as measured by
low interest rates. I thought the country got into trouble because so many people, taking advantage of
"cheap money," borrowed well beyond their ability to repay these loans. In other words, cheap money, in the
form of low interest rates, interest-only loans, adjustable-rate mortgages, etc. were a distortion of the market,
leading directly to our current problems. If interest rates had been higher, borrowers would have valued the
money more, and would not have been willing or able to borrow much more than they could afford.

In 1889, a one ounce $20 gold piece would pay a gardener's wages for a month, though he also got room
and board, according to an old pay record. Today, a trained beginning gardener makes $400 a week. That
"$20" gold coin buys two weeks of his labor at today's bullion prices.
A gold coin will always buy what it always did -- regardless what the paper dollar price might be.

The gold standard is both an affirmation of an individual's right to freely engage in trade, and a check on the
Leviathan of government. One is compelled to conclude, in the words of economist Joseph Schumpeter, that
our politicians "dislike gold because it blurts out unpleasant truths."

Judy Shelton's proposal for "parallel [gold and paper] currencies operating side-by-side" is doomed to failure
due to the operation of Gresham's Law. Sir Thomas Gresham, an English financier (1519-1579), observed

that when two or more kinds of money of unequal exchange value are in concurrent circulation, each being
available for payments, the one of inferior value tends to drive the one of higher value out of circulation.
Everyone would seek to pay obligations in paper Federal Reserve notes and receive payment in gold coin.
Thus, gold coins will not circulate and will be hoarded.

Gold Passes $1,000 Mark, Putting It Near 2008 Record

Gold Passes $1,000 Mark, Putting It Near 2008 Record

Gold prices pushed past $1,000 a troy ounce, the highest point in nearly a year, as continued weakness in
stocks and broader economic concerns sent investors in search of a haven.
The price of the thinly traded nearby February gold futures contract rose $25.70, or 2.6%, to settle at
$1,001.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract reached as
high as $1,004.90, the loftiest front-month price since March 2008. The price of the most-active April gold
contract rose $25.70 to $1,002.20.
"We're seeing investors rush into gold as a crisis of confidence continues to emerge," said Ralph Preston,
senior market analyst with Heritage West Financial.
On technical charts, gold is a momentum play, he said. "Once these things start running, it's the herd
mentality," Mr. Preston said.
Shortly after gold trading closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 191.95 points at 7274, after
dipping as low as 7249.47, the softest point since October 2002.
"Global investors appear to have just opened the doors to a den full of hungry, cranky, and no longer
hibernating bears," wrote Kitco Bullion Dealers analyst Jon Nadler in a research note.
"How scary is that?" he said. "Scary enough to send anyone with whatever cash they had left into the one
part of the global cave that feels relatively safe from a mauling at the moment: gold and the dollar."
Whether stocks continue to decline will likely determine how high gold goes in the near term. A stabilization
in stocks would likely lead to profit-taking in the metal.
Because gold is considered a safe asset to hold, investors have been flocking to the metal in hopes it will
hold its value more strongly than stocks.
"Gold is a function of the fear trade right now," said Zachary Oxman, senior trader with Wisdom Financial.
The surge Friday brought gold close to the front-month record of $1,014.60 hit in March 2008. Gold still is
well behind the inflation-adjusted 1980 record of more than $2,200.
Gold inched above $1,000 in early trading but pulled back as that level proved to be a point of psychological
resistance, sparking profit-taking, said Charles Nedoss, senior account manager and metals analyst with
Peak Trading Group.
It turned higher again near the close of the pit-traded session. "There really is no other place to go," said
Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management. "People are scared."
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices bounced back from deep losses on the back of an intraday recovery in U.S. equities
markets. The expiry of the March contract added to the trading volatility. Light, sweet crude oil for March
delivery fell 54 cents, or 1.4%, to $38.94 a barrel on the Nymex.
SOYBEANS: Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade continued to fall under the weight of global economic
worries and wet weather in previously thirsty South American growing regions. Prices had rallied early this
month because of dry weather in soy-growing areas of Brazil and Argentina, but timely rains have reduced
the threat of significant crop damage, thus forcing prices back down. March soybeans slipped 22 cents to
$8.6250 a bushel.

Oil ETF Aims to Curb Its Impact on Futures

Oil ETF Aims to Curb Its Impact on Futures

A fund allowing ordinary investors to bet on the price of oil is making changes as it has grown into an
influential presence on the crude market it aims to follow.
The $3.4 billion U.S. Oil Fund LP said it will renew expiring crude futures positions over the course of four
days each month, abandoning a practice rolling its entire oil futures position in a single day.
The exchange-traded fund, created in 2006, lets investors trade oil prices like a stock and uses their money
to buy oil futures on major energy exchanges. The fund has become so popular that as of Tuesday it held
19% of all the crude for April delivery traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and 30% of a similar
contract on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, according to data from the fund and the exchanges.
The fund already has moved out of the front-month March contract, which on Wednesday fell 31 cents, or
0.9%, to settle at $34.62 a barrel on the Nymex.
U.S. Oil's shift comes amid criticism that its size has skewed oil prices and traders were selling ahead of the
widely known days it rolls front-month oil futures, pressuring the price the fund's investors get.
Oil's 76% tumble since July has hurt the fund's performance, but the shape of the futures market itself is
presenting an even bigger problem for the fund and similar investors. Since oil for delivery in the future is
higher than spot prices, U.S. Oil paid anywhere from a $4 to $6.10-a-barrel premium when it sold March and
bought April futures contracts, as robust oil supplies and weak demand pushed down near-term prices
relative to outer months.
In a research note published Tuesday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts pointed out that long-term
holdings in near-term commodity contracts are "not investable," citing the large roll cost.
U.S. Oil's new policy will allow it to find enough counterparties to complete its roll, said a person familiar with
the fund's operations. The fund will stick with holding front-month contracts, however. "You can't go around
changing the rules in the middle of the game," the person said. "USO was designed to be the front month, for
good or for bad."
Kevin Norrish, a commodities analyst at Barclays Capital, said the new policy likely won't have much impact
on the structure of the U.S. oil futures market as inventories surge. It is also unlikely to change others'
appetite for trading around the fund's roll period. "The fundamental issue is there's a large amount being
rolled, and people know when it's going to be rolled," he said.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures rallied markedly late in the day session to erase early losses as market worries continued to
drive safe-haven investment in the metal. April gold rose $10.70 to settle at $978.20 an ounce on the Comex
division of the Nymex.
SUGAR: Futures neared two-week lows on speculative fund selling and technically related weakness.
Traders rolled positions out of the March contract ahead of its expiration next week. March sugar on ICE
Futures U.S. fell 0.29 cent to settle at 12.69 cents a pound.

Europe's Problems Rise in East
How alarmed should Western European countries be by the scale of the economic crisis in Central and
Eastern Europe?
Very -- judging by Austria's recent warning that the region faces a potential catastrophe that could destabilize
the whole Continent. It is easy to see why Austria is worried. Central and Eastern European, or CEE,
countries absorb about a fifth of Austria's exports, and its banking system is most heavily exposed to the
region -- where some countries' economies are in free fall as exports have evaporated. Latvian and Estonian
GDP contracted by about 10% in the fourth quarter.
That leaves foreign institutions -- which own about half of CEE banking assets -- facing big losses. A
particular problem stems from the region's penchant for foreign currency loans, which make up much of
Western banks' $1.4 trillion assets in the region.
Companies and households took advantage of low interest rates and stable exchange rates to borrow in
euros and Swiss francs. In Estonia and Latvia, foreign-currency loans make up more than 80% of the total.
Borrowers in the region now face the prospect of spiraling interest costs as some currencies plunge and
others come under pressure.
Goldman Sachs reckons that in a worst-case scenario, Austrian banks could be hit by 14 billion euros (about
$18 billion) of bad debts from their Eastern European subsidiaries -- equivalent to more than 5% of GDP.
While very painful for Austria, with public debt equivalent to 63% of GDP, that is manageable.
The real risk to the euro zone is that Western banks start to pull back from the region as loan losses worsen.
That could trigger a balance-of-payments crisis similar to Asia's in the 1990s. Western banks would then face
far bigger losses, putting more pressure on the euro-zone financial system.
That prospect still looks a ways off. Some European Union countries wanted to stop their banks using
government funds to recapitalize their CEE subsidiaries. But that was blocked by the European Union
following successful lobbying from an alliance of banks including Austria's Raiffeisen International and Italy's
UniCredit. Societe Generale is another bank with significant exposure to the region.
The Austrian government is actually considering making some funds available to its banks expressly for
lending abroad. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has pumped $19 billion of emergency funding
into Belarus, Hungary, Latvia and Serbia. The EU and the European Central Bank have provided support.
And CEE economies outside the euro zone will benefit from currency devaluations.
That won't prevent a hard landing. It could stop the problems in CEE economies from destabilizing the euro
zone. But Western European banks and governments need to hold their nerve by remaining committed to the
region. If they retreat, they risk triggering a far greater problem.
-- Matthew Curtin
Investors Seeing Green in Yellow Metal
The rising gold price says investors are starting to freak out over governments' response to the credit
crunch. Sooner or later, central bankers will have to make a convincing case why all the worry is
unwarranted.
Gold is up more than 25% since mid-September. Since then, G7 governments have unleashed an array of
policies, using trillions of dollars, to rescue financial sectors and shore up their economies. For instance, the
Federal Reserve's balance sheet has doubled to $1.84 trillion as it has ramped up lending to banks and
bought debt.

--- Page 34 ---
Page 34 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The justification for this unprecedented expansion: It is necessary to avoid protracted deflation and help the
economy absorb the shock of global deleveraging.
Goldbugs aren't convinced central banks' flood-the-zone approach will work. They have a point -- calibrating
the response looks tough. If the massive monetary response overshoots, it leads to high inflation, benefiting
gold. And if it undershoots, deflation remains. While falling prices don't directly help gold, the instability they
create potentially does.
While it may seem too early, central bankers could map out how they plan to decrease their balance sheets
and normalize interest rates if inflation resurfaces. But this could expose some of the dilemmas stemming
from balance-sheet expansion. For instance, asking banks to pay back the large amount of central bank
loans could require them to refinance in private markets. But what happens if private investors don't have
sufficient appetite at that time?
The Fed and others need to start walking investors through such scenarios. This is one area where silence
isn't golden -- except for investors in the metal itself.
-- Peter Eavis
Bears Go Bullish on Banks
There aren't many investors left with the credibility to call the bottom of the U.K. banking crisis. But two
longstanding bears have taken the plunge.
Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management and Peter Davies of Lansdowne Partners have turned positive on
U.K. banks, according to their latest investor letters. That is one big gamble.
It s a bet that the British government is determined to avoid further nationalizations and will be extraordinarily
generous in its asset-protection plan.
The government would be brave to hand such a public windfall to the same hedge funds that made so much
money shorting the banks on the way down. But even if the Treasury does offer shareholders a free pass,
how much do Mr. Odey and Mr. Davies stand to make? U.K. banks trade at around 0.5 times tangible book
value. For the banks to trade at a multiple of book, investors must assume they will deliver returns in excess
of the cost of equity.
But even if the cost of equity eventually falls back from current levels of 15% to 20%, returns in the
less-leveraged, more-regulated postcrisis banking sector may struggle to get back above the midteens. That
could mean a long-term multiple of not much more than one times book -- or twice today's level. That doesn't
look compelling enough for an investment, given the probability of losing the lot.
-- Simon Nixon
For Sirius,
Liberty Isn't
Freedom
The battle for control of Sirius XM Radio Inc. has proved to be the best radio drama in many years. And it isn't
over yet.
Liberty Media Corp.'s agreement to lend $530 million doesn't guarantee Sirius stays in orbit. The broadcaster
only received $280 million upfront, with most of that used immediately to pay off $172 million in bonds. To get
the rest of the money, Sirius has to persuade holders of $350 million in bank debt due in May to extend the
debt.
Assuming that deal gets done -- and if Sirius is no longer burning through cash in its operations -- the
company should have the funds to pay off the second big maturity this year, bonds due in December. The
size of that maturity shrank to $228 million from $400 million Friday when some investors swapped their
bonds for 2011 notes carrying better terms.
Any hiccup in paying off these bonds could cause complications, as Charles Ergen's EchoStar Corp. -- which
kicked off the battle for control by buying some of the February bonds that were redeemed Tuesday -- owns
most of them.
Of course, the agreements with Liberty and bondholders only defer until 2011-12 refinancing issues that
confronted Sirius this year. Hopefully by then an improvement in the credit markets, and Sirius's profitability,
will make refinancing easier.

--- Page 35 ---
Page 35 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Even so, the upside for Liberty is more from a financial-return standpoint than from anything strategic related
to its big stake in DirecTV Group Inc. Liberty gets a 15% interest rate, $30 million structuring fee and decent
security on its loans. Not to mention, should all go according to plan, an effective controlling stake in the
company.
-- Martin Peers
Overheard
Out of the frying pan into the fire? It is a long tradition for rich Latin Americans to save money offshore, in
dollars. The trouble is, many did so with Stanford Financial -- now charged with an $8 billion fraud.
Venezuelans appear to have borne the brunt. There, the continent's usual political and inflation risks had the
added spice of Hugo Chavez as president. Mixed with the millions of petrodollars generated in the recent
boom, it was a happy hunting ground for Stanford offering fancy rates on certificates of deposit. According to
a person familiar with the situation, about $3 billion, or 40% of the firm's high-yielding CDs, were originated
from Venezuela, another 20% from Mexico.
A warning sign that went unheeded: The company bought a conspicuous, mirrored office building on a prime
corner in Caracas's posh El Rosal neighborhood four years ago. Apart from a bank branch at the bottom, no
one ever moved in.

Tuesday's Markets
Dow, at 7552.60, Plumbs Bear-Market Low --- Wal-Mart Gains, but That's It as Industrials Slide 3.8%;

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled to its bear-market low in a broad selloff, as investors worried
about the global economy and the health of financial institutions fled to the safety of gold and Treasury
bonds.
Following declines in Asia and in Europe, the Dow opened lower and then slid further, finishing down 297.81
points, or 3.8%, at 7552.60, just a hair's breadth above its Nov. 20 closing low of 7552.29. It hit an intraday
low of 7551.01 less than a minute before Tuesday's close.
The declines sparked worries of an even bigger slide to come. "Some people think it's bullish that we've been
near the lows a couple times and not broken through yet, but I tend to think the other way," said Chip Hanlon,
president of Delta Global Advisors in Huntington Beach, Calif. "The more times you test a low, the odds
should go up that it's going to give way."
Just one of the Dow's 30 components finished higher. Wal-Mart Stores rose 3.7% after issuing a rosy outlook
for the first quarter and the full year.
Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and General Motors all fell more than 12%.
GM had a Tuesday deadline to submit recovery plans to the government as part of an agreement to receive
billions of dollars in federal loans. Analysts and investors fear that GM may be facing an imminent bankruptcy
filing if it can't find ways to cut its costs.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index slid 4.6% to 789.17, less than 40 points above its Nov. 20 closing low
of 752.44. All its sectors declined, led by a 9.5% decline in financials. The Russell 2000 index of small stocks
fell 4.3%.
Decliners outnumbered advancers more than 10 to 1 at the New York Stock Exchange.
Gold, meanwhile, rose 2.7% to $967 a troy ounce, within sight of its record close of $1,003.20 last March. As
Treasury prices rose, yields fell to their lowest levels since late January. The yield on the two-year note was
at 0.875%.
Investors will be watching President Barack Obama's speech Wednesday about plans to help the housing
market. Stocks bounced back the day after hitting their Nov. 20 lows on optimism about economic stimulus to
come but since then, government announcements have failed to lead to a sustained rally. Stocks tried to rise
Tuesday after the president signed the latest stimulus bill but quickly declined again.
The Dow is now down nearly 14% this year and 47% below its October 2007 record close.
Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, estimated
that the market could perhaps slide an additional 5% to 10% if it closes below its late-November lows. "We've
told clients that there will eventually be a great buying opportunity in this market, but it's not time to be a hero
yet," he added.
A decline in Japan's fourth-quarter and full-year GDP amid collapsing demand for its products sent Asian
stocks lower and the decline continued in Europe after Moody's Investors Service warned of bank exposure
to faltering Eastern European economies.
Fears of continued weakening of global demand sent most commodity prices lower. Crude-oil futures slid
nearly 6.9% to $34.93 a barrel in New York. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index fell 4.3%. In addition to
being a safe haven investment, gold also benefited from buying by Russia's central bank.

Stanford Depositors Head To Antigua for Redemptions
Stanford Depositors Head To Antigua for Redemptions

Depositors from as far away as Colombia have begun arriving in the island nation of Antigua, seeking to
withdraw their money from an offshore bank under investigation by U.S. state and federal authorities.
Stanford International Bank Ltd. and related firms controlled by Texas businessman R. Allen Stanford have
fallen under scrutiny by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
other regulatory bodies, according to people familiar with the matter.
Authorities are examining the group's marketing practices, which include offering certificates of deposit with
unusually high interest rates, as well as a mutual-fund product sold by Stanford Trust Co., a person familiar
with the matter says.
On its Web site, Stanford says the product, known as Stanford Allocation Strategies, aims to "reduce volatility
throughout the investment cycle." Investigators are looking at whether Stanford provided false historical return
data that bolstered its performance, this person said.
Reached by telephone on Monday afternoon, the chief financial officer at Stanford International Bank, James
M. Davis, declined to comment when asked if investors are having difficulty obtaining redemptions. "I don't
have any comment, but I appreciate your call," said Mr. Davis, the longtime top aide to Mr. Stanford.
A Stanford spokesman said because of the holiday he was unable to comment on the mutual-fund product.
Mr. Stanford said in a conference call to employees Tuesday there would be a temporary moratorium of two
months on early redemptions for CDs, according to one Stanford financial adviser who has worked at the firm
for about five years. Several depositors say they have been told the same thing.
Depositors sign contracts that state redemptions are accommodated at the discretion of the institution, said
the adviser, who added that he himself has a sizable amount of money invested in the bank's CDs.
The bank says it has more than 30,000 investors and $8.5 billion in assets; it says the larger group of which it
is a part manages over $51 billion in assets. A spokesman for parent company Stanford Financial Group,
based in Houston and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, said depositors may withdraw funds in accordance with
the terms of their accounts.
In Antigua, anxious depositors have flown in from overseas to seek their money from Stanford International
Bank, housed in an imposing neo-Georgian building beside Antigua's international airport.
Lawyers said at least some depositors were being allowed to withdraw funds under the terms of their
certificates of deposit. Meanwhile, some local clients have also responded to the news headlines by pulling
funds from the separate Stanford-controlled Bank of Antigua. Clients have been told processing of the
withdrawals could take several days, according to depositors and attorneys.
One depositor arrived Monday on her first visit to this lush Caribbean island, mobbed in recent days by British
tourists following their national cricket squad taking on the West Indies.
"This is not a vacation, I'm here to calm my nerves," said the depositor, who said she has hundreds of
thousands of dollars tied up in Stanford certificates of deposit. She said a Stanford representative in
Colombia told her he submitted the withdrawal request Friday and that it would take five days to process.
Despite such assurance, she said she remained nervous. "For some people, this isn't a lot of money. For me,
this is my life."
One depositor in Houston said he tried to redeem his CDs worth roughly $500,000 Friday morning after
reading newspaper articles about the investigation into Mr. Stanford's operations. The rate on his CDs was
8.25%, he said. His advisor told him he couldn't redeem them for two months.

"Ironically, I thought it was one of the more safe investments," he said. "My fear is that some investors are
being allowed to redeem CDs while others are not. I am trying to get additional information about the bank
and my redemption request, but have been unsuccessful so far."
Atlanta lawyer James A. Dunlap Jr. said he has been advising a retired woman in Texas who invested about
$250,000 in Stanford Bank CDs. "She has been advised she can't withdraw it," Mr. Dunlap said. "She was
just told that she can't withdraw it now, but they are working to try to raise funds to be able to make a
redemption good." Mr. Dunlap is soliciting other Stanford customers as potential clients through an ad on
Google.
Mr. Stanford, a flamboyant entrepreneur who launched a Caribbean airline that subsequently went out of
business and has lavished money on real-estate ventures in Antigua, has been ratcheting back his spending
lately. Local reports say Stanford-related enterprises have laid off more than 200 workers recently. A Stanford
spokesman said in an email: "In the current economic situation, we are doing what every responsible
company is doing: undertaking a number of expense management measures and reallocating capital and
resources where they can have the greatest impact."
Just over three months ago, Mr. Stanford paid out $20 million in prize money to the winners of a single cricket
match in Antigua. Mr. Stanford announced his inaugural tournament by descending on Lord's Cricket Ground
in London in what was described as a gold-plated helicopter. According to the Times of London, Mr. Stanford
now plans to continue the tournament but in reduced form.

In "Reaganomics vs. Obamanomics" (op-ed, Feb. 11), Peter Ferrara correctly points out that President
Obama's statement that "We're guided by what works, not by any ideology or special interests" is untrue, and
that his policy has been guided by liberal ideology rather than what has been proven to work. One could
argue that if someone knows everything that will work, he wouldn't be in a "crisis." But Mr. Ferrara should
have pointed out that Ronald Reagan (and Margaret Thatcher) were also acting on conservative ideologies
when they faced similar economic crises when they came to office. Mrs. Thatcher famously pointed out that
"The trouble with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money."
As William James noted, we all have our ideologies to help us through crises, the trick is keep studying the
world so you choose the right one to believe in.

What's missing in Mr. Ferrara's analysis is how closely Bushanomics mirrored Obamanomics in three out of
four factors. President Bush allowed regulations, as measured by the size of the Federal Register, to grow
dramatically. His 40% increase in discretionary spending is the largest increase since Lyndon Johnson. And
most importantly, Chairman Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve has been pursuing the most expansionary
monetary policy since Jimmy Carter, creating the speculation in the housing market and its subsequent
collapse. Ronald Reagan understood that a strong economy followed naturally from a dollar that was "as
good as gold." He knew reductions in marginal tax rates increase entrepreneurial risktaking, and that
controlling a regulatory environment best described by P.J. O'Rourke as "bureaucratic time, which is slower
than geologic time, yet more expensive than the time spent with Madame Claude's girls in Paris."

A Duel to Be King of Crude --- Is West Texas Tops, or Is Brent Better? Price Gap Widens

A Duel to Be King of Crude --- Is West Texas Tops, or Is Brent Better? Price Gap Widens

Oil prices fell Thursday. Or they rose.
The correct answer depends on which kind of crude you're talking about, and the world's two benchmarks
have never been as far apart.
Light, sweet crude-oil futures for March delivery. traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, lost $1.96, or
5.5%, to settle at $33.98 a barrel.
A similar blend of oil from the North Sea, known as Brent, rose 37 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $44.65 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
Brent futures' huge, $10.67 premium over light, sweet crude -- a blend that includes the widely known West
Texas Intermediate -- adds to recent confusion about the price of oil, a crucial data point for businesses,
consumers and economists. It's also reignited a pointed debate over which benchmark is best.
WTI is widely cited in the press as a proxy for the price of oil. When crude made headlines as it hit $100 a
barrel last year, it was the Nymex that observers cited.
Normally, WTI costs more than Brent, reflecting the U.S.'s status as an oil importer. The premium draws
cargoes of crude west across the Atlantic. But oil stockpiles are surging at Cushing, Okla., a pipeline nexus
that serves as the delivery point for Nymex crude, putting extreme pressure on the price of WTI.
With WTI prices out of sync from many other types of oil, some question its relevance. As a reflection of the
broader market, "WTI has become about as useful as a chocolate oven-glove," Barclays Capital said in a
note last month.
WTI is known as a light, sweet crude, one that yields more valuable products like gasoline from each barrel.
Yet even oil grades that are its poor chemical relations have been selling at a premium to the front month.
Mars, called a sour crude because of its high sulfur content, Thursday traded at $8 a barrel above March
WTI.
The U.S. benchmark has defenders. The number of such 1,000-barrel contracts open on Nymex is almost
twice the number of ICE Brent contracts, giving people more parties to trade with. ICE also offers a West
Texas contract of its own that doesn't result in physical delivery.
"The market has spoken with a thundering blast that WTI is more important," said Bob Levin, managing
director of energy and metals research at Nymex parent CME Group Inc.
A spokeswoman for ICE's parent, IntercontinentalExchange Inc., says Brent better reflects global oil prices.
Supporters say Brent is a better indicator for markets because it is delivered off the coast of Scotland and
easily shipped around the world.
In other commodities markets:
GOLD: Safe-haven buying and investment demand continued to drive gold futures higher, analysts said.
Nearby February gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange added $4.70 to settle at
$948.50 a troy ounce, while most-active April also rose $4.70 to settle at $949.20.
COTTON: Prices on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange continued their down trend because of shaky economic
sentiment. Nearby March cotton settled 0.8 cent lower at 45.03 cents a pound. The most-active May contract
fell 0.52 cent to 46.47 cents, after touching a six-week low of 46.38 cents late in the session.

Gold Is Flirting With $1,000, Again; 'There's No Sign of the Market Tiring'

Gold may have $1,000 in the crosshairs again, though analysts say whether the market returns there in the
foreseeable future hinges on whether strong safe-haven buying continues.
A flight to safety by investors fleeing stocks coupled with a move past certain technically important price
points propelled gold to the highest settlement since July 22.
The price of the nearby gold futures contract for February delivery rose $30.10, or 3.3%, to settle at $943.80
an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting as high as $947.20
during the day. The most-active April contract rose $30.30 to $944.50, after hitting as high as $949.
Gold is now just 5.9% from its Comex record close of $1,003.20 hit March 18, 2008, though it would have to
hit $2,255 to surpass the 1980 record of $875 on an inflation-adjusted basis.
"We're seeing flight-to-quality buying," said Sterling Smith, vice president with FuturesOne.
Buying momentum was sparked when stocks sold off Tuesday on disappointment over the lack of specifics in
a bank-rescue plan outlined by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
"After [Tuesday's] Treasury announcement, markets aren't quite convinced that recapitalization of banks is
aggressive enough," said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist with BMO Capital Markets. "There are very
few details of how this is going to be done."
Demand for gold exchange-traded funds, bars and coins remains strong, said HSBC analyst Jim Steel.
Holdings of gold backing the world's largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Shares, rose 12.85 metric tons Tuesday
to a record 894.72. A metric ton equals 2204.62 pounds.
"Obviously $1,000 is in everyone's sights," said Larry Young, senior trader with Infinity Futures.
While it is hard to say whether gold will hit this, "we at least look poised to trade higher," Mr. Steel said.
"There's no sign of the market tiring."
BMO this week figured gold might top $1,000 again in 2010, but it could occur sooner if the relentless
investment demand continues, Mr. Melek said. "If we continue to have this aggressive safe-haven buying,
this could happen in fairly quick order," he said. "But we still think this would likely not be sustainable at these
levels."
In other commodity markets:
PLATINUM: Prices rose with gold on haven buying, though Mr. Melek noted some traders also might look for
an increase in auto sales if economic-stimulus efforts succeed in the U.S. and China. Others cited spread
trading favoring platinum on ideas it recently was undervalued against gold. Most-active April platinum rose
$45.80, or 4.4%, to $1,080.70 an ounce on Nymex and hit as high as $1,085, its strongest level since Sept.
29.

Capitalism Needs a Sound-Money Foundation

Let's go back to the gold standard.
If the very idea seems at odds with what is currently happening in our country -- with Congress preparing to
pass a massive economic stimulus bill that will push the fiscal deficit to triple the size of last year's record
budget gap -- it's because a gold standard stands in the way of runaway government spending.
Under a gold standard, if people think the paper money printed by government is losing value, they have the
right to switch to gold. Fiat money -- i.e., currency with no intrinsic worth that government has decreed legal
tender -- loses its value when government creates more than can be absorbed by the productive real
economy. Too much fiat money results in inflation -- which pools in certain sectors at first, such as housing
or financial assets, but ultimately raises prices in general.
Inflation is the enemy of capitalism, chiseling away at the foundation of free markets and the laws of supply
and demand. It distorts price signals, making retailers look like profiteers and deceiving workers into thinking
their wages have gone up. It pushes families into higher income tax brackets without increasing their real
consumption opportunities.
In short, inflation undermines capitalism by destroying the rationale for dedicating a portion of today's
earnings to savings. Accumulated savings provide the capital that finances projects that generate higher
future returns; it's how an economy grows, how a society reaches higher levels of prosperity. But inflation
makes suckers out of savers.
If capitalism is to be preserved, it can't be through the con game of diluting the value of money. People see
through such tactics; they recognize the signs of impending inflation. When we see Congress getting ready
to pay for 40% of 2009 federal budget expenditures with money created from thin air, there's no getting
around it. Our money will lose its capacity to serve as an honest measure, a meaningful unit of account. Our
paper currency cannot provide a reliable store of value.
So we must first establish a sound foundation for capitalism by permitting people to use a form of money they
trust. Gold and silver have traditionally served as currencies -- and for good reason. A study by two
economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Arthur Rolnick and Warren Weber, concluded that
gold and silver standards consistently outperform fiat standards. Analyzing data over many decades for a
large sample of countries, they found that "every country in our sample experienced a higher rate of inflation
in the period during which it was operating under a fiat standard than in the period during which it was
operating under a commodity standard."
Given that the driving force of free-market capitalism is competition, it stands to reason that the best way to
improve money is through currency competition. Individuals should be able to choose whether they wish to
carry out their personal economic transactions using the paper currency offered by the government, or to
conduct their affairs using voluntary private contracts linked to payment in gold or silver.
Legal tender laws currently favor government-issued money, putting private contracts in gold or silver at a
distinct disadvantage. Contracts denominated in Federal Reserve notes are enforced by the courts, whereas
contracts denominated in gold are not. Gold purchases are subject to taxes, both sales and capital gains.
And while the Constitution specifies that only commodity standards are lawful -- "No state shall coin money,
emit bills of credit, or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts" (Art. I, Sec. 10) --
it is fiat money that enjoys legal tender status and its protections.
Now is the time to challenge the exclusive monopoly of Federal Reserve notes as currency. Buyers and
sellers, by mutual consent, should have access to an alternate means for settling accounts; they should be
able to do business using a monetary unit of account defined in terms of gold. The existence of parallel
currencies operating side-by-side on an equal legal footing would make it clear whether people had more

confidence in fiat money or money redeemable in gold. If the gold-based system is preferred, it means that
people fully understand that the purpose of money is to facilitate commerce, not to camouflage fiscal
mismanagement.
Private gold currencies have served as the medium of exchange throughout history -- long before kings and
governments took over the franchise. The initial justification for government involvement in money was to
certify the weight and fineness of private gold coins. That rulers found it all too tempting to debase the money
and defraud its users testifies more to the corruptive aspects of sovereign authority than to the viability of
gold-based money.
Which is why government officials should not now have the last word in determining the monetary measure,
especially when they have abused the privilege.
The same values that will help America regain its economic footing and get back on the path to productive
growth -- honesty, reliability, accountability -- should be reflected in our money. Economists who promote the
government-knows-best approach of Keynesian economics fail to comprehend the damaging consequences
of spurring economic activity through a money illusion. Fiscal "stimulus" at the expense of monetary stability
may accommodate the principles of the childless British economist who famously quipped, "In the long run,
we're all dead." But it shortchanges future generations by saddling them with undeserved debt obligations.
There is also the argument that gold-linked money deprives the government of needed "flexibility" and could
lead to falling prices. But contrary to fears of harmful deflation, the big problem is not that nominal prices
might go down as production declines, but rather that dollar prices artificially pumped up by government
deficit spending merely paper over the real economic situation. When the output of goods grows faster than
the stock of money, benign deflation can occur -- it happened from 1880 to 1900 while the U.S. was on a
gold standard. But the total price-level decline was 10% stretched over 20 years. Meanwhile, the gross
domestic product more than doubled.
At a moment when the world is questioning the virtues of democratic capitalism, our nation should provide
global leadership by focusing on the need for monetary integrity. One of the most serious threats to global
economic recovery -- aside from inadequate savings -- is protectionism. An important benefit of developing a
parallel currency linked to gold is that other countries could likewise permit their own citizens to utilize it. To
the extent they did so, a common currency area would be created not subject to the insidious protectionism of
sliding exchange rates.
The fiasco of the G-20 meeting in Washington last November -- it was supposed to usher in "the next Bretton
Woods" -- suggests that any move toward a new international monetary system based on gold will more
likely take place through the grass-roots efforts of Americans. It may already be happening at the state level.
Last month, Indiana state Sen. Greg Walker introduced a bill -- "The Indiana Honest Money Act" -- which
would, if enacted, allow citizens the option of paying in or receiving back gold, silver or the equivalent
electronic receipt as an alternative to Federal Reserve notes for all transactions conducted with the state of
Indiana.
It may turn out to be a bellwether. Certainly, it's a sign of a growing feeling in the heartland that we need to go
back to sound money. We need money that works for the legitimate producers and consumers of the world --
the savers and borrowers, the entrepreneurs. Not money that works for the chiselers.

No Time for Warner to Cut Cable
Sometimes, it is only when you break up with someone that you truly appreciate them. That may be how
Time Warner feels about Time Warner Cable in a year's time.
The spinoff of the cable company, expected to be completed next month, has been years in the making. But
the logic of it looks less compelling now than ever.
Partly that is because of the recession. Time Warner Cable is likely to demonstrate its steadiness in a
downturn this year, when analysts expect its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to
grow 2.4%. In contrast, Sanford C. Bernstein expects Ebitda from what is left of Time Warner to shrink 6.9%.
Even over a longer time frame, the admittedly capital-intensive cable business has outgrown the broad
content industry. Since 2002, for instance, Time Warner Cable's Ebitda is up 124%. The only other Time
Warner business to grow at anything close to that rate was cable networks, which nearly doubled its Ebitda.
Film, in contrast, was flat, while publishing and AOL were both down.
Cable has been helped a little by acquisitions. But most of the company's growth has come from new
businesses like high-speed Internet and phone, along with new video services like digital video recorders.
It isn't a secret that some of those new revenue streams have come at the expense of content. DVRs, in
particular, have curbed advertisers' appetite for network television. High-speed Internet has helped fuel the
explosion of online video, which clouds the future of film and television.
In the past, having both cable and content in one company ensured Time Warner as a whole could capture
the shifts of value from one to the other. But separating the two businesses means any secular decline in film
and cable networks will show up much more starkly.
There already are signs the film studio's DVD gold mine may have run its course. And the steady advertising
growth at Time Warner's cable networks -- fueled in part by cable's share of ad spending rising to meet its
audience share -- will likely slow from the same forces damping broadcast-network advertising, including
DVRs and the movement of ad dollars to the Web.
Admittedly, Time Warner Cable faces its own challenges. Competition from phone companies is helping drive
up programming costs while steadily eating into TWC's pool of customers. Still, with only 32% of potential
high-speed Internet customers taking it, and phone penetration even lower, there is still plenty of room for
growth.
There isn't any doubt the cable split has short-term benefits for Time Warner, giving it a big cash infusion that
allows it to reduce debt and return cash to shareholders. Longer term, as the media industry evolves in
unpredictable ways, investors may miss the hedge once offered by cable.
-- Martin Peers
For Geithner, Taxpayers and Shareholders Both Have Their Demands
For years, Wall Street believed Timothy Geithner would give it a sympathetic hearing. Now it faces a rival for
the Treasury secretary's attention: the American voter.
Mr. Geithner's Financial Stability Plan maps out some big moves to revive the financial system and make
huge sums available to boost lending. The steep slide in stocks suggests, however, that investors were far
from impressed. Critics said the plan lacked detail and was too timid in key areas, and said that it could take
too long to implement.

--- Page 48 ---
Page 48 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Given that Mr. Geithner was slated to become Treasury secretary as far back as November, investors are
right to be disappointed that there was so little meat on the bone. But investors should also have recognized
the harsh political realities Mr. Geithner now faces as taxpayers and politicians rebel against the massive
amount of money so far pumped into banks in an apparently haphazard fashion.
The plan does have its eye-popping headline numbers. It envisions a public-private investment trust with as
much as $1 trillion to spend buying troubled assets from banks. In addition, the Federal Reserve's Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility could now have $1 trillion to lend to investors -- up from $200 billion.
But politics played a big role. While Mr. Geithner stressed the need for rapid action on a huge scale, he was
as emphatic that taxpayers must be protected. This potentially leaves him stuck in a position where he cannot
fulfill both pledges.
That is why he wants private buyers, rather than the government, to set prices for bad assets and to provide
much of the capital required. And why he has so far kept the plan vague. For instance, there are no details on
incentives the government may provide to lure private buyers into the plan. This indicates the Treasury is
having great trouble working out how to juice the market without giving away too much taxpayer money.
This caution makes sense. If government giveaways are too big, public opposition to the bailouts could grow
even fiercer, making it harder to craft future economic policy as the crisis drags on.
And a half-completed good plan is better than a series of erratic bailouts in direct response to market moves,
a criticism of the previous Treasury.
Still, if Mr. Geithner wanted some immediate shock and awe he could have extended Fed asset purchases
into new areas. After all, recent buying of mortgage-backed securities and commercial paper has brought
relief to those sectors. These were done quickly and with limited political fallout. If speed is of the essence,
Mr. Geithner still has options.

The Illusion
Of Cheap
Borrowing
Are governments falling into the same trap as subprime borrowers? Much of the subprime crisis stemmed
from low teaser rates that reset higher, causing financial stress. Governments currently funding massive
borrowing with ultralow short-term rates could be running a similar risk.
The average interest rate on T-bills -- short-term government securities -- fell to 0.806% in January from
3.528% a year earlier, as risk-averse investors fled for safety and the Fed cut interest rates. That suited the
government, which increased bills outstanding by 84% to $1.8 trillion. In the process, the average Treasury
interest rate fell to 3.116% in January from 4.573% a year earlier. T-bills account for 31% of Treasury
securities, from 21% a year ago.
In Europe, too, governments have used more short-term debt. But the growing use of T-bills poses risks.
First, countries may become overreliant on short-term funding, leaving them exposed to volatile markets. An
increase in short-term rates would feed into higher interest payments much more quickly than rising long-term
rates, where the debt stock rolls over more slowly.
Second, countries that wait to refinance short-term debt at longer maturities may find it becomes more
expensive. Government 10-year bond yields have risen this year despite horrendous economic data, and the
cost of insuring sovereign debt against default has climbed. That suggests investors are building a greater
credit premium into these rates. They may also be worried about supply and long-term inflation risk. Today's
cheap borrowing costs could yet prove illusory. As governments contemplate ever-higher levels of borrowing,
they should think about refinancing sooner rather than later.

World News: Kazakhstan Devalues Its Currency by 25%

ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Kazakhstan's central bank said Wednesday it allowed a 25% devaluation of the
national currency in an effort to protect its foreign-exchange and gold reserves and boost Kazakh
manufacturers' competitiveness.
The central bank cited falling oil prices and the devaluation of Kazakhstan's trading partners' currencies as
key reasons for the devaluation of the currency, the tenge.
"Oil is 60% of Kazakhstan's total exports and is the main foreign-currency income in the financial market," the
central bank said. The slumping "price of oil in the last six months forces the revision of exchange-rate
targets."
Katya Malofeeva, an economist at Moscow-based Renaissance Capital, said the devaluation will help "take
the pressure off the central bank to spend reserves in order to defend the tenge, as well as improve the
financial position of exporters, including metals miners." She added that "the central bank can now
concentrate on controlling inflation."
Ratings agency Standard &Poor's said the devaluation carries risks for Kazakhstan. "The impact on the
banking sector, which is highly leveraged externally, is negative," it said.
Central Bank Gov. Grigoriy Marchenko said the central bank couldn't make a decision to devalue the tenge
until the state took controlling stakes this week in BTA Bank and Alliance Bank, Kazakhstan's biggest and
fourth-biggest banks by assets.
Luis Costa, an emerging-market debt strategist at Commerzbank in London, said "the drastic
foreign-exchange move will make government presence in the [banking] sector even more important. We
cannot discount further nationalization." The central bank also said it was lowering the official refinancing
rate to 9.5% from 10%. It will also ease reserve requirements on domestic and foreign liabilities.

You wouldn't know it from the U.S. stock market, but there are some incipient signs of optimism in financial
markets.
Some commodities are showing price gains. So are stocks in commodity-exporting countries such as Brazil.
Some investors have been buying corporate bonds again as strong companies start issuing new debt,
although prices and yields aren't nearly back to normal.
Investors call this the reflation trade -- a bet that the world's leaders will succeed in staving off depression and
deflation, and will gradually return the world to economic growth. Some see inflation rising again later this
year.
Copper futures are up 5% so far this year and have gained 17% from the low hit late last year. Tin futures are
up 7% in 2009. Brazil's main stock index has risen 5% this year, and South Korea is up 3%.
The optimism looks more like a whiff than a strong wave, however, and many skeptics believe it will end
badly. The gains are spotty.
The Hong Kong stock market is down 8% so far this year. Crude oil and corn futures both are off 7% in 2009.
Some markets, including the U.S. stock market, have given back most of their big upswings from late last
year, as U.S. stocks have turned in one of their worst Januarys ever.
Many investors still fear the recent rebound could be just another blip, before markets fall to new lows.
Few are jumping in with both feet, but optimists are gradually boosting their holdings of stocks, corporate
bonds, commodities and other risky assets. They say lasting recoveries sometimes happen this way, with
choppy gains here and there.
The gains reflect a hope that global growth will recover later this year, with developing countries such as
China and Brazil rebounding sooner than the U.S., Europe or Japan.
Some people are gradually moving money away from U.S. Treasury bonds, which had been so much in
demand as a haven that their yields had shrunk to multidecade lows as prices soared. Many still crave the
safety of Treasurys, so prices remain high and yields low. But as a few people move money into riskier
investments, Treasury prices have fallen a bit, pushing the yield of the 10-year Treasury note up to about
2.8% Friday from less than 2.1% on Dec. 18.
Skeptical investors point out that markets staged several temporary rebounds last year, only to sag again as
the depth of the global economic woes became clear. The pessimists call the recent rebound in riskier assets
a "dead-cat bounce" -- a brief recovery followed by more declines. The phrase is derived from a Wall Street
saying that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough.
"I think if you are a nimble short-term trader, you could try to play it," said David Kotok, president of
money-management firm Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J. But others "could get sucked into a dead-cat
bounce." Mr. Kotok hasn't boosted his exposure to U.S. stocks or to most commodities, although he has
slightly increased his holding of gold and silver, which can do well when government debt is soaring and the
government is pumping money into the economy.
A drumbeat of depressing economic and corporate-profit data drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
8.8% last month, its worst January decline in its 113-year history.

But even in the Dow, there was a sign that investors haven't given up hope. Every time it has fallen to around
the 8000 level in recent weeks, the Dow has managed to rebound.
It was testing that level again on Friday, when it finished at 8000.86. Investors don't have a lot of hope for
U.S. stocks yet, but many believe they will escape significant new trouble.
"I hope we've passed the worst," said William Hackney, chief investment officer at Atlanta Capital
Management in Atlanta. Given how far stocks have fallen already, "the economic news doesn't have to get
good, it just has to get less bad. We ought to be getting in a position over the next six months to at least stop
declining and perhaps turn up a bit."
Last fall, managers of one of the pension plans with which he works decided to stop buying stocks entirely,
even though it meant letting the plan's stock exposure fall below the level they themselves had set. Now they
have decided to boost shares back to the agreed-upon level, which means buying stocks.
They aren't taking an aggressively optimistic position on stocks, just rebalancing their holdings from an
aggressively pessimistic position. That kind of thinking by many investors has helped keep the 8000-level
floor under the Dow. If investors are optimistic about anything, it is a rebound in the developing world, which
explains the recovery of some stocks there.
Plenty of people, however, fear it is too soon to be turning hopeful.
Signs of economic recovery, even in the developing world, aren't widespread enough to quiet the concerns of
Jeff Schappe, chief investment officer at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C.
After briefly turning more positive in the first part of last year, Mr. Schappe cut his stock allocation last fall,
moving to 60% from 65%. Since then, he says, he has had to grit his teeth to avoid cutting stock exposure
further.
"Our theme right now is that this is not a time to be a hero," Mr. Schappe said. He is buying high-quality
corporate bonds but not junk bonds. He is urging clients to focus mainly on stocks of companies with strong
balance sheets, such as Wal-Mart Stores, McDonald's and some drug makers. He has no interest in most
commodities but has been thinking about boosting his gold allocation.
Others are ready to take the plunge, or at least dip a toe in the water.
It isn't just high-grade corporate bonds that are rebounding, notes James Paulsen, chief investment strategist
at Wells Capital Management. Junk bonds are up, companies are finding it easier to issue commercial paper
and mortgage rates are down.
Typically, the stock market rebounds months ahead of the economy, meaning that you need to hold your
nose and buy stocks when the economy still looks terrible, he adds. What's more, he has studied past
rebounds after major declines, and found that they can be much sharper than people realize.
He has been bullish and wrong up to now, he says, but now he believes signs are pointing his way.
"I think most of the storm is past," Mr. Paulsen said.
"When the stock market does turn the corner, it is going to be quicker, faster and harder than people think."

Fuel Hedges Can Fail, Airlines Find --- During Summer, Carriers Bet on High Crude Prices; Problem Is, They Slid

Fuel Hedges Can Fail, Airlines Find --- During Summer, Carriers Bet on High Crude Prices; Problem Is,
They Slid

Airlines are learning a painful lesson: Timing the oil markets can be much harder than scheduling flights.
When oil prices soared last summer, airlines barreled into hedges aimed at shielding them from even higher
jet-fuel costs. Oil's 70% fall since then is causing turbulence.
Delta Air Lines Inc. on Tuesday reported a $507 million loss on its fuel hedges in the fourth quarter, pushing
the largest U.S. airline by traffic to an overall net loss of $1.44 billion. United Airlines parent UAL Corp. had a
$370 million fuel-hedging loss in the latest quarter.
Just six months ago, fuel hedging by airlines won praise on Wall Street as a sign of smart management.
About 30% of airlines' operating expenses go toward fuel, according to the Air Transport Association of
America, a trade group.
After locking in their fuel costs, airlines got burned when prices turned against them. In the typical hedge used
by the carriers, airlines are protected against any prices rising above a certain cap -- but required to post
collateral if prices drop below the so-called floor.
Some hedges made in the first half of 2008 set the floor prices at anywhere from $90 a barrel to more than
$100. With oil falling as low as $33.87 on Dec. 19, airlines had to hand over mountains of cash to trading
counterparties.
At year end, UAL had posted $965 million in collateral related to its fuel hedges; American Airlines parent
AMR Corp. had about $575 million in cash collateral. Even Southwest Airlines Co., known as a particularly
shrewd fuel hedger, had about $300 million of cash collateral deposited with counterparties at Jan. 20.
"It's an uncharted territory for most of them," said Basili Alukos, an airline analyst with Morningstar Inc.
Airlines have "never dealt with hedging to this extent."
Investors have punished carriers for their backfiring hedges, with some airline stocks sliding more than the
overall market since July. In response, some airlines are retreating from fuel-price hedges.
In the fourth quarter, Southwest cut its hedged positions to about 10% of its fuel consumption each year
through 2013. At the end of September, Southwest had 75% of its 2009 fuel consumption hedged at a floor
price of $61 a barrel.
Southwest said it still believes hedging is a wise long-term strategy. For now, though, the airline feels
comfortable being at the mercy of oil prices.
"We've managed it for a bear market, and we will be prepared for a bull market when that turn comes, and
surely, it will," said Gary Kelly, Southwest's chairman and chief executive, in a conference call on Jan. 22.
"But certainly, for the time being, we foresee very soft energy prices."
UAL purchased put options in January for 35% of its first-quarter fuel consumption. UAL essentially is
counting on oil to stay lower than $57 a barrel in the current quarter, hoping that will offset losses on collar
hedges now capped at $104 a barrel.
"The cash impact, while significant, is now behind us," Kathryn Mikells, UAL's chief financial officer, said in a
Jan. 21 conference call. "We are well-positioned to manage through a challenging 2009."
Some analysts aren't so sure. "Ironically, we believe United may have successfully hedged itself out of
enjoying the drastic fall in crude-oil prices," wrote Morningstar's Mr. Alukos in a research note.

Delta has 80% of its first-quarter fuel consumption hedged.
AMR has 42% of its first-quarter fuel consumption hedged at $68 a barrel, so AMR will have to pay more for
this part of its fuel than current market prices. The company also has 45% of its consumption hedged at a cap
of $93 a barrel, which will be worthless if oil prices don't surge to that level.
On Friday, crude-oil futures edged up 24 cents, or 0.6%, to $41.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. They fell $2.92, or 6.6%, in January.
In other commodities markets:
GOLD: Safe-haven buying, plus ideas global stimulus efforts will lead to inflation and currency debasing,
sent gold to the highest close since July, up $22.20, or 2.5%, to $927.30 an ounce on Nymex's Comex
division. Gold rose $43.70, or 5%, in January.

Large Stock Focus: Reverse It: Citi, BofA Head Back Downward

Stocks fell, as the financial sector gave back the bulk of its Wednesday gains and investors realized there
was no quick fix for the likes of Citigroup and Bank of America when the housing and labor markets are under
such severe stress.
The biggest decliner on the Dow on Thursday was one of the biggest gainers Wednesday, and underscored
the pivotal nature of the financial sector for the broad market: Bank of America fell 61 cents, or 8.3%, to
$6.78; among rivals, J.P. Morgan Chase shed 2.23, or 8.1%, to 25.43; Citigroup shed 30 cents, or 7.1%, to
3.90.
The outlook for the banks is inextricably linked with that of the economy because of the hundreds of billions of
dollars of mortgage securities and consumer loans on their books. Thursday, the Commerce Department said
sales of new single-family homes fell 14.7% in December to a record low. Traders call it a "negative feedback
loop," because weak banks and slowing lending can, in turn, hurt home lending and the overall economy.
Ford Motor shed eight cents, or 3.9%, to 1.95. The auto maker reported a $5.9 billion fourth-quarter loss,
wider than expected, and said it doesn't plan to seek government assistance.
Dow component General Motors fell 24 cents, or 7%, to 3.18.
Boeing fell 2.53, or 5.9%, to 40.71. Standard &Poor's Ratings Group took the first step to a potential
credit-ratings downgrade on the aerospace giant because of deteriorating conditions in the aviation market
world-wide and the likelihood customers would have a tougher time getting financing.
Continuing unemployment claims -- those drawn by workers collecting benefits for more than one week -- hit
4.78 million last week, the highest level since the government started tracking the data in 1967.
International Business Machines fell 2.31, or 2.4%, to 92.51. An organization representing IBM workers said
about 1,800 people were laid off by the computer services and software giant in addition to 2,800 jobs the
organization reported were eliminated earlier this week. IBM reportedly employed 400,000 people at the end
of 2008.
Insurer Allstate dropped 6.14, or 21%, to 23.50. The largest publicly traded auto and homeowners' insurance
provider swung to a fourth-quarter loss, and Standard &Poor's downgraded its credit ratings. With job losses
piling up and the economy worsening all the time, people may be cutting back on car and home insurance.
American depositary shares of Sony fell 66 cents, or 3.2%, to 20.27. The Japanese manufacturer of
consumer electronics said the stronger yen and weak demand weighed on fiscal-third-quarter profit, and
reiterated that it would likely record its first net loss in 14 years in March.
Dell (Nasdaq), which shed 93 cents, or 8.5%, to 9.95, said late Wednesday its fiscal-fourth-quarter 2009
results will include $280 million in expenses related to a continuing cost-cutting program and stock
compensation.
Commodities and industrial stocks were under pressure. The International Monetary Fund recently warned
that global economic growth would "slow virtually to a standstill" this year, hurting the prospects for the prices
of many materials.
Alcoa fell 31 cents, or 3.5%, to 8.44, and United States Steel fell 1.91, or 5.5%, to 32.89.
Gold is a major exception, benefiting from "safe-haven" buying and efforts to hedge against the inflationary
effects of central-bank policies.

Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining rose in tandem with the price of the precious metal, adding 83 cents,
or 2.1%, to 39.44.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 226.44 points, or 2.7%, to 8149.01, wiping out Wednesday's 200-point
gain and snapping a three-session winning streak. The broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index fell 28.95, or
3.3%, to 845.14. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite fell 50.5, or 3.2%, to 1507.84.

Gold Climbs 1.9% to $905.10

Gold Climbs 1.9% to $905.10

A resumption of safe-haven buying enabled gold to halt a two-day profit-taking slide and head higher again.
The nearby February gold contract rose $16.90, or 1.9%, to $905.10 an ounce on the Comex division of the
New York Mercantile Exchange, while the most-active April contract advanced $16.50 to $906.50.
The gains occurred as stocks sank and traders remain worried about the banking sector, said George Gero,
vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
"It's the old safe-haven argument," said Gijsbert Groenewegen, managing partner at Silver Arrow Capital
Management. Thus, gold rose on a day when the dollar strengthened, even though the metal normally
moves inversely to the greenback, he said.
April gold recovered from overnight weakness after dropping $30.50 between Monday's $911 intraday high to
Thursday's $880.50 intraday low.
"The market needed a correction," said Bill O'Neill, one of the principals with Logic Advisors. "It was
overbought."
But even as the recent pullback occurred, there was good scale-down in buying, particularly out of Europe,
Mr. O'Neill said. "The market is clearly reflecting concerns about the financial system and banking system,"
he said.
Furthermore, Mr. O'Neill said, the rally has attracted "solid physical backing." Jewelry demand has been soft
lately, which analysts blame on the higher price. But interest in coins and bullion remains strong, and the
metal held by exchange-traded funds has climbed steadily this month.
Holdings in SPDR Gold Shares, the world's largest gold ETF, stood at a record of 832.88 metric tons at the
end of business on Wednesday. This was up 52.65 tons, or 6.7%, since the end of 2008. This is significant
for the market since metal is put into vaults to back ETF shares, which trade like a stock but track the price of
a commodity.
Several analysts cited offsetting factors that could leave gold trading volatile for a while. At times, current
disinflation in a soft economy holds back the metal, they said. But at other times, support comes from
save-haven buying and the belief that government stimulus efforts will lead to inflation.
In other commodities markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures fell on weak demand, though concerns about gasoline supplies prevented a bigger
decline. While most of the energy market ended nearly flat, RBOB gasoline futures took off, with the February
contract settling 4% higher at $1.2309 a gallon. Traders have begun to price in the possibility that low
refinery-processing rates will result in tight gasoline supplies as demand picks up in the spring and summer.
Light, sweet crude oil for March delivery fell 72 cents, or 1.7%, to $41.44 a barrel on the Nymex.
NATURAL GAS: Futures gained after the release of a U.S. government report showing a
bigger-than-expected, 186 billion cubic feet decline in storage levels in the week ended Jan. 23, as gas was
drawn off to meet heating demand during a harsh cold snap across much of the U.S. Natural gas for March
delivery on the Nymex advanced 15.6 cents, or 3.53%, to $4.576 a million British thermal units.

Oil Up as Gasoline Stocks Fall

Crude-oil futures rose on a surprise drop in gasoline inventories, though continued concern about the weak
U.S. economy prevented larger gains.
Oil prices were pulled higher by gasoline futures, which surged after a Department of Energy report showed a
draw on fuel inventories last week, defying most forecasts. Gasoline inventories fell by 100,000 barrels in the
week ended Jan. 23, where analysts had given an average estimate of a 1.5-million-barrel build, in a Dow
Jones survey.
Light, sweet crude for March delivery settled 58 cents, or 1.4%, higher, at $42.16 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Front-month February reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled 7.50 cents,
or 6.8%, higher, at $1.1835 a gallon. February heating oil settled 4.70 cents, or 3.4%, higher, at $1.4215 a
gallon.
Oil's gains were meager compared with the previous day's 9% plunge, however, as few were willing to bet
that gasoline demand had turned a corner. The same government report found that products supplied by
refiners, a proxy for oil demand, dropped 4% in the month ended Jan. 23. Oil inventories also rose by 6.2
million barrels last week, far exceeding analysts' expectations and highlighting the weak state of U.S.
demand.
"The idea is that [refinery] runs are going to be cut further, and that could tighten up gasoline supplies," said
Jim Ritterbusch, president of the trading advisory firm Ritterbusch &Associates in Galena, Ill., referring to the
rate at which refiners process crude into gasoline. "But runs are being cut because there's too much gasoline.
I don't see products pulling crude higher, I see a chance of crude pulling products lower."
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: The metal gave up some of its recent gains on profit-taking as some risk aversion left the markets and
investors returned to equities. Most-active January gold lost $11.10 to $888.10 an ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, while most-active April fell $11.40 to $890. The metal
extended its decline in after-hours screen trading after a Federal Reserve statement said inflation remains
"subdued."
ORANGE JUICE: Futures fell 3.5% as bulls sold on thoughts that a large-scale damaging crop freeze
wouldn't occur in Florida this year. A cold snap last week was only expected to produce localized damage to
orange groves. ICE Futures U.S. March frozen concentrated juice fell 2.55 cents to 71.30 cents a pound.

Davos: World Economic Crisis: A Revived IMF Pursues Less-Stringent Lending

DAVOS, Switzerland -- The global financial crisis has revived the International Monetary Fund, which just a
year ago was pushing to sell a chunk of its gold reserves because it was making so few loans it didn't have
enough income. Now, it has committed about $50 billion in loans to try to rescue Pakistan, Iceland and a
clutch of Eastern European countries.
The IMF's role will be a focus of attention at this year's World Economic Forum, where political leaders of
Pakistan and Latvia will discuss their experiences, as will the No. 2 official at the IMF, John Lipsky. This is a
new-look IMF. Gone are many loan requirements that developing nations found onerous: privatize social
security, open markets to foreign financial firms, break up local monopolies. The changes have made turning
to the IMF more palatable domestically -- other nations, including Turkey, are now in talks with the IMF for
loans. It may even ease the way for some heavily indebted Western European countries to seek IMF help
later on.
"The change reflects a shift away from the thinking that the IMF can micromanage a country," said
Anne-Marie Gulde, an IMF senior adviser for Europe.
In making the loans, the IMF sought to learn the lessons of the Asia crisis of a decade ago. Then, the fund
was criticized for making demands -- such as opening the way to U.S. banks in South Korea and breaking up
a clove monopoly in Indonesia -- that locals interpreted as heavy-handed and politically motivated. Moreover,
with the U.S. and Western Europe slashing interest rates and boosting government spending to fight
recessions, IMF officials said they couldn't ask borrowers to make the tough cuts they once would have.
The IMF is still far from a fast-track loan program for developing nations. Rather, it confines its demands to
the monetary and fiscal policy in which it is expert. For some countries, that still can mean difficult changes.
Latvia, for instance, must slash the salaries of teachers, soldiers and other government workers by 15%,
while Ukraine must cut its spending at a time when the economy is expected to contract severely -- a
prescription that is bound to make its recession worse, at least for a time.
Some Eastern European countries receiving IMF assistance figure that it's only a matter of time before the
IMF resumes trying to get involved with the innards of their economies. "The IMF will use [the deepening
economic crisis] to ask more and more of countries," said a central banker in Eastern Europe. The IMF says it
doesn't have such plans.
The IMF's goal is to help stabilize poor countries battered by a recession that sharply reduced exports to rich
countries as financing to developing countries dried up. The Institute of International Finance, a trade
association of large financial institutions, estimates that private flows of capital to developing countries will
drop by about two-thirds, to $165.3 billion this year from $465.8 billion in 2008.
Looking for alternative financing, the Eastern European nations of Ukraine, Latvia, Serbia and Belarus have
turned to the IMF, and economists figure Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania aren't far behind.
The IMF test-drove the new policy in 2007 with a $77 million loan to Lebanon, whose economic reform plan
the IMF basically adopted in its entirety.
Last year, the IMF, which had a tense relationship with Pakistan, agreed to easier terms than it would have in
the past on a $7.6 billion loan.
The IMF largely accepted the budget-deficit target the Pakistanis proposed, said Mohsin Khan, the IMF's
former chief for the Middle East, and didn't push to end certain farmland tax breaks, as it had in the past,
even though it believes the breaks are manipulated by manufacturers. Mr. Khan said Pakistan agreed to
make the central bank more independent and to reduce subsidies, which should help to ease its budget
problems.

One sign that the IMF strategy may be working: protests in Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania and elsewhere have
been directed at governments instead. "People do not see the IMF as a big Western institution telling us what
to do," says Gyula Toth, a Hungarian economist at UniCredit in Vienna.

Lords of Finance
By Liaquat Ahamed
(Penguin Press, 564 pages, $32.95)
Paper is what our money is made of, and a lucky thing, too -- or so readers of this history of an earlier
monetary mess are meant to understand. Needing to brace up the economy or rescue the financial system, a
central bank can just print the stuff. Indeed, the Federal Reserve has been doing just that at breakneck
speed since the panic of 2008 began. Compare the ease of duplicating the millennial dollar with the drudgery
of mining its gold-standard forebear.
"Lords of Finance" is a modernist's account of the errors that helped to produce the Great Depression. It is
also, necessarily, a provocation to debate about this, our Great Recession. Liaquat Ahamed is the modernist
in question, and he writes with all the world-wise assurance of the professional investor, World Bank alumnus
and Brookings Institution trustee that he is.
Mr. Ahamed gives us rich portraits of the principal central bankers of the 1920s and 1930s and of the world
they unintentionally wrecked: Benjamin Strong, the Ben S. Bernanke of his time but without the college
education; Strong's best friend Montagu Norman, the emotionally fragile governor of the Bank of England;
and Horace Greeley Hjalmar Schacht, Germany's central banker, who "managed to look like a compound of a
Prussian reserve officer and a budding Prussian judge who is trying to copy the officer."
None of these worthies is cast as a hero, in Mr. Ahamed's telling, but the villain of the piece is the gold
standard. Or, rather, the villain of the piece is what Mr. Ahamed inexactly and unhelpfully describes as "the
gold standard." His quarrel is actually with the goldexchange standard, a road-show version of the genuine
article.
The gold standard -- i.e., the gold standard -- was the monetary system more or less continuously in place
between Waterloo and World War I. It was simplicity itself. Bank notes were exchangeable into gold, and
gold into bank notes, at a fixed, inviolable rate. A central bank's everyday job was to facilitate this exchange.
Of what we know today as "monetary policy" -- i.e., manipulating interest rates or the money supply to
promote full employment or to pull the economy out of the ditch -- the conscientious central banker would
have no part.
This gold standard perished in World War I. In its place, the governments of the postwar world established a
system that looked like the gold standard. Currencies were said to be "backed" by bullion. But, in fact, the
central bankers overrode the gold-standard rules. They manipulated interest rates and exchange rates and
otherwise gummed up the exquisite gold-standard works. What looked like the gold standard bore no real
relation to it. People suspected as much, for gold coins, in most countries, disappeared into private hoards
rather than circulating from hand to hand as they had done for generations before the Great War.
That gold standard -- the gold-exchange standard -- remains in force, in its essential attributes, today. What
backs millennial currencies, of course, is nothing but the good intentions of the central banks that issue them.
But gold backing is not, in fact, the essential feature of a properly functioning gold standard. What made that
self-regulating system tick was the simple rule that a dollar or a franc or a pound could not be in two places at
the same time. Gold movements between debtors and creditors ensured as much.
You might suppose that so basic a feature of the physical world would naturally rule the financial one. But the
post-World War I wrecking crew discovered that a certain privileged kind of money could be made to do
double duty. This was the "reserve currency." The pound sterling was the original reserve currency, the top
monetary brand of the day. The U.S. dollar is its successor. It was given to Britain, later to the U.S., to have it
both ways, to consume much more than it produced but never to have to pay its foreign creditors in anything

except the paper that it alone could lawfully print. And as if that were not good enough, the creditors dutifully
reinvested the pounds or dollars in the securities of the debtor government. It was heaven on earth, while it
lasted.
Of course, it didn't last; it never does. Inflation -- of prices or of credit -- brings down the hammer. The
disservice that Mr. Ahamed does to history is to fail to distinguish between the flaws of the classical gold
standard, on the one hand, and the far deeper imperfections of the gold-exchange standard (so similar to the
evils of today's dollar standard), on the other.
There was something about the real McCoy that rankled intellectuals. H.G. Wells, quoted here, spoke of the
"magnificent, stupid honesty" of gold standard 1.0. To John Maynard Keynes the sheer caprice of digging up
gold out of the Earth only to rebury it in the vaults of the Bank of England was insupportable. And Keynes, so
Mr. Ahamed insists, was right: "There is no greater testament of his legacy . . . than that in the 60-odd years
since he spoke, . . . armed with his insights, the world has avoided an economic catastrophe such as
overtook it in the years from 1929-33."
Hold on a minute: Has Mr. Ahamed spoken too soon? One may hope not, yet his superb descriptions of the
unraveling of the early 1930s are creepily evocative of today's crisis. A reader of "Lords of Finance" will be
unprepared, looking up from the text, to absorb the ghastly headlines on cable TV. Has humanity not learned
its lesson? Has the substitution of learned economists for inert gold bars truly delivered us from credit
collapse and international bank runs? The author seems to say so. "The Fed," he writes of the interventionist
style of monetary management that the gold-exchange standard encouraged in the 1920s, "had undertaken
a totally new responsibility -- that of promoting internal economic stability." Thanks, Ben Strong. Thanks, Ben
Bernanke.
If Mr. Ahamed were casting around for a genuine hero of interwar finance, he missed his man. Jacques
Rueff, the great French economist, sounded the alarm time and again. The classical gold standard was an
instrument of economic balance, he wrote, its successor an engine of excess. "For ten years," Rueff declared
in a speech in 1932, "we had done everything in our power to undermine that equilibrium."
Harrumphing about the "gold standard," Mr. Ahamed reminds me of the fellow who condemned "painting"
because he had no use for Andy Warhol.

For Some, Sound of Profit Is 'Timber!' --- While Other Investments Wither, Forest Land's Value Keeps Growing

Growing

WINCHENDON, Mass. -- Money still grows on trees.
Timberland, which a few years ago became a popular investment among institutions and wealthy folks, has
held up amid market massacres for most other assets lately.
Through Sept. 30, the value of timberland rose 5%. When the National Council of Real Estate Investment
Fiduciaries reports 2008's final quarter this week, this number is unlikely to move much. That marks a slower
pace of growth, yet it is growth nonetheless. In 2007, timber appreciation was a towering 15%.
How can positive returns exist in these dark days of shrunken prices for everything ranging from real estate to
commodities to stocks? Oil, after a summer price spike, was down 54% in 2008, while corn lost 11% and
copper 54%. (Gold, as a refuge commodity, rose 6%.) Prices for lumber, a key forest product, have fallen by
34% over the past year as housing construction has ebbed.
The answer to this riddle is that timberland is the ultimate long-term investment, with relatively little bought
and sold each year -- and demand still respectable for what does change hands. "As long as the sun shines,
the trees will grow," says Jeremy Grantham, chairman of Boston money manager GMO and a long-time fan
of timber investing. "Timber will never be an orphan."
Timber often is likened to high-grade bonds, meant to be held for 10 years or more. The average annual
timberland appreciation for the past decade is 4.1% versus minus 3.8% for the Standard &Poor's-500 stock
index. The timberland appreciation figure, which encompasses both the land and the trees, is based on sales
and appraisals. After 10 or 15 years, investors cash out when the land is sold.
On top of the appreciation, timber generates regular income. Trees are constantly chopped down and sold for
everything from boards to paper mulch, albeit in smaller volumes these days. Cash returns from this
"harvesting," as it's called, are now 1.5% of the property value, down from 3% in 2007 and about 5% annually
the three years before that.
Nobody creates investor dividends quite so dramatically as a woodsman. Standing amid 70-foot pines that
thrust into the cool New England air, Dag Rutherford, a rangy veteran forester, gives the go-ahead to start the
day's cutting. "These trees took decades to grow," says Mr. Rutherford, a senior vice-president at Bank of
America's U.S. Trust wealth-management unit, which runs this tract for a rich family. "People still need wood."
This day's tree toppling, in the deep woods about 100 miles from Boston, should bring up to $8,000 worth of
lumber. The operation is masterfully efficient, capable of felling around 80 trees in two hours. Time was, a
lumberjack with a chain saw would take a day to do that.
For this job, though, Mr. Rutherford has hired a giant machine that resembles something out of the movie
"Transformers." Run by one man in a cabin atop a tractor-like chassis, this $1 million harvester machine has
a huge claw that grabs a trunk and swiftly severs it with an embedded saw. The tree falls noisily to earth with
a bird-frightening crash. Then the tree is fed through the claw, which snips off branches and slices the trunk
into 16-foot logs.
The 6-foot-4 Mr. Rutherford, born in Canada, spent his youth working on family timberlands in his ancestral
Norway and has forestry in his blood. Both sides of his family tree have loggers. As he tromps through the
Massachusetts boondocks, he sees a sapling. "This will be a mighty oak in 75 years," he says. "No quick
pay-offs here."
Back in the late 1990s, when investors were obsessed with tech stocks, timberland seemed stodgy and
fetched around $700 to $800 an acre, according to the Conservation Fund, a big timberland buyer. Then
came the past decade's housing boom, and big investors got interested. Wood-products giants like

Weyerhaeuser Co. cashed in by divesting vast forested tracts to a welter of private partnerships, university
endowments, real-estate investment trusts and other financial buyers.
Prices have since risen to the $1,500 to $3,000 range, depending on the quality of the wood.
One allure of timber is that it isn't closely correlated with other asset classes. That's because it is highly
flexible. Other organic commodities like corn or pork have to come to market in season, or they will rot.
"Trees keep growing 4% per year, no matter what happens to inflation, interest rates or market trends,"
says Dennis Moon, head of U.S. Trust's group overseeing timberland, as well as farm and mineral
investments. "You don't have to cut them down this year if that doesn't make sense."
On the downside is that, as the ultimate long-term investment, timber is very illiquid. Looking to park your
kid's college tuition someplace for eight years? Forget wood. Plus, timber's cost of entry is dauntingly high.
The best returns, adjusted for risk, come from large, multimillion-dollar partnerships called timber-investment
management organizations, or TIMOs, sponsored by the likes of GMO and U.S. Trust. But these require a
minimum $250,000 investment, and often many times that.
TIMOs' overhead can be onerous, too: They may charge from 3% to 5% per year in assets for property
management, taxes and insurance.
A cheaper way of investing in timber is via several real-estate investment trusts. Most prominent is Plum
Creek Timber Co., the largest private land holder in the U.S. Investors can get in for around $32 per share.
Over the past 52 weeks, its price has fallen 26%, better than the S&P 500's 37% drop. Indeed, Plum Creek's
showing is better than the S&P paper and forest product index, which has slid 50%. The index is focused on
board-making companies like Weyerhaeuser, whose fortunes are more closely tied to the housing industry,
rather than the slow-growing majesty of a maple.

Sovereign-Debt Selloff
Spurs Quest for Safety
Gold busted out in a big way Friday, raising the possibility that the yellow metal will make another run at
$1,000 amid the worsening outlook for economies around the world.
The rally in gold has coincided with a selloff in benchmark sovereign debt around the world, suggesting that
investors are becoming more concerned about the ability of various nations to handle the economic crisis.
In this tumultuous period, the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the U.K. pound and most Asian currencies,
with somewhat more subdued strength against the euro. But gold is outpacing the dollar, leading some to
believe that the dollar's rally may soon end as investors retreat to the safety of gold.
"The market is increasingly aware of the notion that the dollar is not rallying on improvements in
fundamentals, but because of the banking troubles in the U.K. and the sovereign downgrades in the euro
zone," says Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in London. "The situation in the U.S. is still
very bad. The twin deterioration in the economic data and the banking losses shows that the dollar rally is
only by default and not a reflection of improvement in the U.S. currency."
Gold for January delivery settled up 4.3%, or $37.10, at $895.30 a troy ounce Friday on the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest settlement since Oct. 8, and rose 6.7% for the week. This
has started to pull in buyers in other areas, including gold-focused exchange-traded funds, mining stocks,
and other metals.
Meanwhile, movement in Treasury inflation-protected securities suggests that investors are starting to
expect higher inflation. Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller Tabak, notes that the 10-year
TIPS reflects inflation expectations of 0.72% over the next 10 years, up from 0.65% Thursday, and from
0.047% on Nov. 20.
That, along with the selloff in global bonds, shows an expectation for higher inflation down the road. But the
bond selloff -- and increase in the cost of insuring sovereign debt against default through the purchase of
credit-default swaps -- suggests that the primary concern of investors may be credit risk.
"We're effectively seeing competitive rounds of currency devaluation," says Andrew Montano, director of
precious metals at ScotiaMocatta. "Currencies will get deflated against hard assets, and the ultimate hard
asset is gold."

Geithner Is Exactly Wrong on China Trade
Geithner Is Exactly Wrong on China Trade

Treasury Secretary-designate Tim Geithner's charge that China "manipulates" its currency proves only one
thing. Three decades after Deng Xiaoping's capitalist rise, America's misunderstanding of China remains a
key source of our own crisis and socialist tilt.
The new consensus is that America failed to react to the building trade deficit with China and the global
"savings glut," which fueled our housing boom. A "passive" America allowed China to steal jobs from the U.S.
while Americans binged with undervalued Chinese funny money.
This diagnosis is backwards. America did not underreact to the supposed Chinese threat. It overreacted. The
problem wasn't "global imbalances" but a purposeful dollar imbalance. Our weak-dollar policy, intended to
pump up U.S. manufacturing and close the trade gap, backfired. Currency chaos led to a $30 trillion global
crash, an energy shock, bank and auto failures, and possibly a new big government era. For globalization
and American innovation to survive, we must first understand the Chinese story and our own monetary
mistakes.
We've heard the refrain: China's rapid growth was a mirage. China was stealing wealth by "manipulating" its
currency. But in fact China's rise was based on dramatic decentralization and sound money.
After 500 years of inward looking stagnation, Deng opened 1979 with a bang. He freed 600 million peasants
with history's largest tax cut. He emulated Hong Kong and Taiwan by establishing four Special Economic
Zones on the sleepy southern coast. Before Beijing hard-liners knew it, mayors across China were
demanding similar low-tax, local-control freedoms. By 1993, 8,000 of these of these entrepreneurial free trade
zones had swept the nation. Two hundred fifty million people migrated to this "new China," where tax rates
were low and regulations few. Capital poured in from China and the world.
Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) were an unexpected but powerful innovation. Fiercely competitive
and locally owned, these quasigovernment entities escaped Beijing taxation. Propelled by local knowledge
and a zero corporate tax rate, the TVEs by 2000 accounted for half of China's output.
China needed an anchor for its complex transformation and in 1994 linked its currency, the yuan, to the U.S.
dollar. The dollar-yuan link allowed a real price system to arise in China and created a single economic fabric
stretching across the Pacific. Before long, the whole region had adopted what Stanford economist Ronald
McKinnon calls the East Asian Dollar Standard.
The opposite of currency "manipulation," this dollar standard was a victory for free trade and global growth.
But U.S. economists missed its portent. The Fed and Treasury of the late-1990s did not supply sufficient
dollars to match rapidly growing global demand. A scarce dollar shot higher, and hard assets fell. Oil
plummeted to $10 a barrel, gold fell to $250 from $400, credit shriveled, and dollar debtors across Asia went
bankrupt. With an appreciating dollar and a world in turmoil, capital flooded into the U.S. and especially our
soft, intellectual assets -- Cisco, Microsoft and dot-coms. The technology boom and bust was not a function of
easy money but a scarce dollar.
In 2003, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke identified an exotic threat: deflation. The Fed was seven years
late. Mr. Greenspan's post-9/11 liquidity had already ended the 1997-2001 deflation. Yet the Fed persisted
with 1% interest rates through 2003-04 and easy money thereafter. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary John
Snow targeted China and its trade surplus as a big threat. He and his successor Hank Paulson agitated for a
stronger yuan and thus a weaker dollar.
Treasury's trade-deficit mania encouraged anti-China politicians. Messrs. Snow, Greenspan, Paulson and
Bernanke several times talked Sens. Chuck Schumer and Lindsay Graham off the protectionist precipice. But
the administration did not realize that the weak-dollar policy was itself protectionism.

China was imparting deep changes on the world economy. Yet in 2003 U.S. manufacturing was 50% larger
than in 1994. U.S. knowledge industries were generating most of the world's profits and wealth. American
consumers were benefiting from low-cost imports. Meanwhile, many Asian goods were rerouted through
China for final assembly. The U.S.-China trade deficit thus grew even as the total portion of U.S. imports from
East Asia fell below 35% from 40% in 1990.
The real threat was a devalued dollar. In mid-2005, we finally forced China to delink from the dollar and mildly
appreciate the yuan. Nevertheless, the trade deficit accelerated. Robert Mundell -- Nobel laureate, China
expert, father of the euro and supply-side economics -- continued to warn that the trade deficit was perfectly
natural. Worry about currency instability instead.
But other eminent economists urged a "more competitive dollar." On May 13, 2006, this newspaper
headlined: "U.S. Goes Along With Dollar's Fall to Ease Trade Gap." All these "more competitive" dollars had
to go somewhere, and with amazing efficiency found their way into oil and subprime mortgages.
The weak dollar had the opposite of its intended effect. Cheap-dollar commodities exploded the trade gap.
Conceived to make the U.S. "more competitive," the policy channeled money away from technology
innovators and into home-building and home-equity consumption. Inflation for a time does pump up demand,
and so U.S. consumers bought, and Chinese growth shot even higher. Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern
foreign reserves grew, further depressing the yields of U.S. Treasurys.
Some credit indicators are now improving, but the Fed's past destabilization policy will reverberate. The
weak-dollar blunder helped scuttle the Doha Round of trade talks and will make the successful Bush tax cuts
difficult to preserve. American interventionism could absolve Europe's anti-innovation "antitrust" policy and
excuse China's worst intellectual property violations and "national champion" subsidies.
And yet, with sound-money advocate Paul Volcker in the Obama White House and Mr. Mundell plugged into
Beijing, the monetary mayhem of the last decade could give way to a worldwide, sound-money revival in
2009 and beyond.

Sliding Pound Hits '85 Level on Dollar

Sliding Pound Hits '85 Level on Dollar

A bout of profit-taking hit the dollar and the yen late Friday, forcing them to give back a large portion of their
early gains.
The dollar bounced off the strongest level against the pound since 1985 as U.S. stocks recovered from
session lows, giving some investors an excuse cut some of their bets on further gains in the dollar and yen
ahead of the weekend, traders said.
The greenback also was undermined by a sharp rise in gold prices, as concerns emerged that economic
stimulus programs in some of the world's biggest economies will fan inflation. Investors bid up gold as an
alternative reserve asset to the dollar as they sought to preserve the value of their funds against the
possibility of rising price pressures.
Gold's rise dragged down dollar sentiment, said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities
Inc. in Toronto.
The dollar continued to feel the pinch from comments Thursday from Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy
Geithner that the Obama administration believes China is manipulating the value of its currency, the yuan.
That fanned worries that the Chinese government could shed Treasury security holdings as retaliation, just at
time when the U.S.'s financing needs are rising sharply.
The pound recovered somewhat from the low of $1.3502 hit overnight following worse-than-expected report
on the U.K.'s gross domestic product that confirmed the country is in recession.
In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro weakened to $1.2985 from $1.3005 late Thursday, while the
dollar edged up to 88.85 yen from 88.71 yen. The euro moved to 115.37 yen from 115.51 yen. The U.K.
pound weakened to $1.3807 from $1.3882. The dollar strengthened to 1.1559 Swiss francs from 1.1540
francs. The dollar weakened to 1.2311 Canadian dollars from C$1.2552.
Despite the bounce in afternoon trade, Hidetoshi Yanagihara, senior currency trader at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in New York, said "the yen will continue to garner demand next week" as investors remain risk
averse amid worries about global growth.
The pound is likely to renew its weakening in the weeks ahead as investors world-wide sell U.K. financial
assets amid signs of a worsening economic and fiscal outlook. "Foreign investors are fleeing the U.K. and I
think the selling momentum will continue," said Richard Franulovich, a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. He expects the pound to weaken to $1.10 to $1.20 before year end.
The sterling has been one of the biggest losers this year, and the selling momentum has intensified in the
past week, especially against the dollar and the yen.
Investors are concerned about the U.K. government's bailout of the banking sector, especially the possible
nationalization of some big banks. That would wipe out common shareholders while raising more questions
about the ability of the U.K. government to service its massive debt payments.

Timothy Geithner's tax oversights drew most of the media attention at his confirmation hearing, but the
biggest news is the Treasury Secretary-designate's testimony Thursday that he'll ratchet up one of the Bush
Administration's worst habits: China currency bashing.
In a written submission to the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Geithner said the Obama Administration
"believes that China is manipulating its currency." He says he wants Treasury to make "the fact-based case
that market exchange rates are a central ingredient to healthy and sustained growth." The dollar promptly fell
and gold jumped $40 on the news.
We're not sure what Mr. Geithner means by "market exchange rates," given that the supply of any modern
currency is set by a monopoly known as the central bank. When Mr. Geithner says China is "manipulating"
its currency, what investors around the world hear is that he really wants Beijing to restrain the number of
yuan in circulation and increase its value vis-a-vis the dollar. That's a call for a dollar devaluation to help U.S.
exporters.
This would seem to be an especially crazy time to undermine the dollar, given that the Treasury will have to
issue some $2 trillion to $3 trillion in new dollar debt in the next couple of years. A stronger yuan would also
contribute to Chinese deflation and slower growth, which would only mean a deeper world recession. Even
the Bush Treasury never formally declared China to be a currency "manipulator" in its periodic reports to
Congress. If the Obama Treasury is now going to take that step, hold onto those gold bars. We're in for an
even scarier ride than the Fun Slide of the last few months.

Investors in gold may feel as if they scaled a steep mountain in 2008, only to proceed to slide right back
down the other side.
Almost a year ago, gold soared to a record $1,002 per ounce, following a similar trajectory of other
commodities. But since then, gold has lost some of its luster. It flirted with the $700 level late last year and
currently trades for $823 an ounce.
That rise and quick fall has many investors wondering: What's next for gold? Because gold can serve as a
hedge against inflation, investors must try to predict whether inflation will continue to be a problem. We've
seen a range of opinions on what is in store for 2009 and 2010. Some camps believe the U.S. could actually
see falling prices this year, leading to deflation.
Some investors are concerned that the Fed has turned on the printing presses in order to buy toxic mortgage
assets and fund bailout plans. That boost in the monetary supply seems to be a big reason why many
economists are expecting inflation to increase in the fourth quarter.
"Every central bank is printing money," says Rob Lutts, president and chief investment officer of Cabot
Money Management in Boston, who has been bullish on gold for four years. "Gold is a buy."
If Mr. Lutts is right, investing in a First Eagle fund may be one of the best ways to get exposure to gold.
Funds like First Eagle Global and First Eagle Overseas traditionally hold gold in their portfolios along with
equities. Another good fund with gold among its holdings is the Permanent Portfolio.
Fidelity Select Gold, which owns nearly 70 mining companies, including Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining,
is yet another mutual fund to consider. Investors just need to be certain that a fund like this works with their
time horizon.
Due to their liquidity and trading flexibility, ETFs are quickly becoming the favorite vehicles for building
investments in precious metals. These investments trade throughout the day like a stock (whereas a mutual
fund is priced just once after the market closes) and don't levy redemption fees.
The SPDR Gold Shares tracks the price increases and decreases of bullion. The iShares COMEX Gold
Trust is a similar fund. Market Vectors Gold Miners tracks an index of 32 mining companies, many of which
are in the Fidelity Select Gold fund.

Bright Young People
By D.J. Taylor
Farrar, Straus &Giroux, 361 pages, $27
If the flappers of the 1920s epitomized the Jazz Age on this side of the Atlantic, in England it was the Bright
Young People. The British milieu of society scions flinging themselves into the nonstop pursuit of fun in the
aftermath of World War I was immortalized -- and hilariously flayed -- by Evelyn Waugh in 1930 with his novel
"Vile Bodies," but the real-life major players who made up this set are long gone. Thanks are due, then, to
English critic D.J. Taylor, who brings them back to life in "Bright Young People." Some were distinguished,
others once famous only for being famous and now pretty much forgotten -- but they were almost invariably
fascinating.
Those cultural critics who believe that America's experiment with Prohibition actually exacerbated binge
drinking rather than curbing it need only look across the pond to see just how prodigious was the British
consumption of legal cocktails. Legal or not, there was plenty of fuel in both countries to keep the 1920s
roaring. And for those who think that freewheeling sex and drugs didn't come into vogue until the advent of
rock 'n' roll, these bright young people might have said, "Well, my dear, the orgies," before tucking into the
heroin and cocaine that were as much in evidence in these circles as face powder. But although this seamy
side of the era occasionally protruded into the public view in law courts and coroner's inquests, for the most
part what the public heard about was pranks, larks and elaborate scavenger hunts -- outrageous fun, just
enough to shock but not to appall the great British public.
For all these goings-on were meat and drink to London's vibrant, rivalrous press world. This was the great
age of the press barons, Lords Beaverbrook, Rothermere, Camrose, Kemsley and the rest, who knew that
nothing sold their newspapers like sensational but not-too-revealing accounts of this madcap crowd's antics.
One of their most widely publicized stunts was a sham exhibition of modern art that, in addition to drawing a
bright-young-people contingent that was in on the joke, brought in a respectful audience. Winston Churchill,
though, took one look at the work of the artist billed as "Bruno Hat" and scoffed: "A lot of bloody rubbish."
The newspapers put a premium on what they could label the inside story. Thus many actual participants
rushed home to file accounts of the parties and other events they had just attended. In addition to Patrick
Balfour (Lord Kinross), one of the most prominent party reporters was the notorious Tom Driberg, who wrote
the Daily Express's William Hickey column. Driberg, a high-church Anglican who was a communist in the
1920s and 1930s, would later become a British agent -- some said a double agent -- and go on to be elected
to Parliament in 1942, eventually being elevated to the House of Lords. His posthumously published memoir
included accounts of homosexual adventure during his younger days that sometimes involved the police --
and Beaverbrook as his rescuer.
These folk had all gone to the right schools (that's how they knew one another) and were well-connected to
the aristocracy and to the worlds of politics and commerce, but their dedication to decadent fun tended to
leave them perennially short of cash. The ones who wrote for the newspapers were well-paid, but they also
performed a vital role. If these goings-on were to thrive, it was essential to have an audience, of course,
because otherwise it just wouldn't have been as much fun. But an important by-product of the endless inside
publicity was to oxygenate the whole phenomenon, to keep it rolling for much of the decade.
Does this prolonged eruption of frivolity have any genuine cultural significance? Emphatically, yes -- if for no
other reason than that it inspired the work of some of Britain's best writers, who were all part of the scene to
varying degrees. The cavorting of these bright young people provided fodder not only for Evelyn Waugh but

also for Nancy Mitford ("Highland Fling"), Anthony Powell ("Dance to the Music of Time"), Henry Green
("Party Going") and the poet John Betjeman ("A Subaltern's Love Song"). "The influence of the Bright Young
People can be felt throughout twentieth-century artistic life," Mr. Taylor writes. "To take only the most flagrant
examples, the London society world of the mid- to late 1920s was a crucible in which were forged the careers
of several of England's greatest novelists, one of its best-loved contemporary poets and half a dozen leading
figures in ballet, photography and surrealist painting."
Mr. Taylor also reminds us of lesser-known characters, such as Beverly Nichols and Bryan Guinness,
up-and-coming writers whose work fed on this scene and who were celebrated in London at the time. The
author's reach extends even to relatively recent days: V.S. Naipaul lived for some time at Wilsford, the estate
of the effete Stephen Tennant, one of the last surviving bright young people, who is portrayed in Mr. Naipaul's
"The Enigma of Arrival."
While arguing for the importance of the bright-young-people moment to future eminences of British arts and
letters, Mr. Taylor also notes how little was achieved by many promising members of the set. One chapter is
titled "The Books Brian Howard Never Wrote," a devastating judgment on a flamboyant figure who inspired
characters in the work of Waugh and others. Howard provides much entertainment in this book as well: "'My
boy,' Howard is supposed to have admonished his boyfriend Sam in a Paris parfumerie just after the war
when the latter began spraying himself with samples, 'you're not putting out a fire.'" But even Howard could
be shocked by some of the wilder London parties. About one gathering in a London hotel room, Mr. Taylor
says, Howard later reported that he ran into the street "clutching my remaining bits of virtue -- bundled them
into a taxi and trundled home. I've never seen anything so stupendously naughty, even in Oxford!"
Howard might have left many books unwritten, but others in this crowd managed in later life to make a real
contribution. Gavin Henderson became a prominent figure in the Labour Party's Colonial Bureau. After he
succeeded as Lord Faringdon, he was also a prominent Labour champion in the House of Lords -- despite his
habit of sometimes addressing his fellow peers as "my dears" instead of the more correct "My Lords!"
But on the whole, the bright young people (sometimes also called bright young things) were a profligate
bunch who succeeded only in giddily frittering away their youth. Why then should we care about them?
Because many came from the aristocracy and families prominent in government (e.g., daughters of the prime
minister and of the lord chancellor), they were part of what decades later would come to be termed the
"establishment." It is simply interesting to know what they were getting up to.
And cautionary tales such as this one are rarely without appeal -- Mr. Taylor does not flinch from presenting
the ghastly underside of all the fun. Debutante Brenda Dean Paul's colorful debaucheries seem a little less
colorful after the author shows her to us years later, when she "became a familiar sight in the King's Road,
'tottering with her friend . . . to refill her hypodermic syringe,' as one onlooker put it. Sitting once in a
restaurant she was observed to top up a syringe containing heroin with water from a nearby vase of flowers."
Squalor, not glamour, comes to mind.
The most moving sections of "Bright Young People" are drawn from the diaries of Arthur Ponsonby, an
aristocrat who was nonetheless a prominent member of the Labour government and whose wife, Dorothea,
was the daughter of composer Hubert Parry. Their daughter, Elizabeth, was a quintessential bright young
thing, Mr. Taylor observes: "louche, irregularly employed . . . indefinably glamorous, well-connected, and, as
such . . . a fixture of newspaper society columns." Waugh would use her as the model for the reckless Agatha
Runcible in "Vile Bodies."
The diaries of Elizabeth's parents, particularly her father's, offer a heartrending view of their anxiety about her
wild ways, her impracticality, her passage through a disastrous marriage to a charming wastrel. We see
Arthur's anguish when he learns that she has killed a friend in a drunk-driving accident and his desperation as
he uses his position of influence to protect her from serious consequences. When Elizabeth dies from acute
alcoholism at age 39 in 1940, he rushes to her flat, but his diary is silent for a year before he describes what
he found, remarking on her "astonishingly lovely innocent face as she lay there dead." Her death, coming as
the country prepares to fight for its very existence, adds a somber postscript to all the bright fun.
The frenetic hijinks had not long survived the 1920s. They went out of fashion abruptly once the Depression
hit. Patrick Balfour, less bright and young than he once had been, knew exactly when the era ended, Mr.
Taylor reports: the morning of Monday, Sept. 21, 1931, when the British government took the pound off the
gold standard. Today the importance of long-ago changes in monetary policy is lost on most, but at the time
wrestling over the gold standard was a cause of passionate debate in many countries. The "significance for
the average British citizen," Mr. Taylor writes, "raised in an atmosphere of solid Edwardian prosperity, cannot
be overstated." Alec Waugh, Evelyn's brother (also a novelist), once said: "For me, and I suppose for most
Britons born before 1910, the announcement that Monday morning was the biggest shock we had known or
were to know."

"Bright Young People" was published last year in Britain. It arrives on these shores with a new resonance as
we contemplate a world in its worst financial straits since the Depression, with many troubling political and
military signs on the horizon as well. Then as now, parties everywhere ended as a more sober age dawned.

Cross Country: California's Gold Rush Has Been Reversed
Cross Country: California's Gold Rush Has Been Reversed

Tulare, Calif. -- On Jan. 24, 1848, James Wilson Marshall found gold at Sutter's Mill, in Coloma, Calif.,
sparking a mad rush of some 300,000 people desiring to strike it rich. San Francisco grew from a tiny hamlet
to a boomtown in no time, and in 1850 California entered the Union as the 31st state.
With this history at their back, state leaders might have understood that people have a propensity to get up
and move when a better life is to be had elsewhere. But no. After more than 150 years of being a destination,
California is becoming a place entrepreneurs, investment capital and the hardy workers who made it a global
leader in agriculture, technological innovation and scientific research are fleeing. This exodus is the marker of
something deeper than a national recession. It's a sign that the attempts by state leaders to spend their way
back to prosperity are killing California.
While it has the sixth highest tax burden in the nation, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation,
California is facing a breathtaking $40 billion budget deficit this year. This comes on the heels of a
decade-long spending spree. Last year the state budget was $131 billion, up from $56 billion in 1998.
Citizens are burdened by all manner of state regulations. To mention just one example, this year a new law
enacted by ballot initiative bans cages chicken farmers use on the grounds that it is inhuman to put birds in
cages that prevent them from spreading their wings. Complying with the new law will cost farmers hundreds
of millions of dollars, which will force many to leave the state. And that will force us to buy our eggs from other
states and, possibly, others nations, such as Mexico.
And just as a fallen tree can divert the flow of water in a creek, bad economic policies divert the flow of
investment. Entrepreneurs and investors, seeking the path of least resistance, leave when it becomes easier
to make a living in more business-friendly states. In 2000, according to the state's Department of Finance,
about 150,000 people moved into California. But in the years that followed the in-migration slowed, and in
2005 it reversed, when a net 52,000 people moved out. In 2008, the outflow topped 135,000 people.
Consequently, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming all have unemployment rates around 5% at a time when California
is suffering an unemployment rate of 9%. Californians are moving east and creating jobs in their new home
states.
Over the past few years, we've witnessed the state government's response to the capital and entrepreneur
flight out of our state: Taxes remain high, and lawmakers employ all the tricks in the book to produce
"balanced" budgets from shifting expenses around to borrowing ever larger sums of money.
It's now time to turn to the ballot initiative and enact needed reforms that elected representatives in
Sacramento have been unwilling to tackle on their own. We're on a dangerous fiscal course, and the people
themselves will have to fundamentally change state government to correct it.
Two broad reforms are needed. The first is that we must create a part-time, nonpartisan citizen legislature -- a
model that has proven effective in states like Texas (part-time) and Nebraska (part-time and nonpartisan).
Californians need to be able to elect leaders whose primary interest is public service, not furthering political
careers.
The second fundamental reform is on taxes and spending. Other states have passed a Taxpayers' Bill of
Rights. We need to do the same, so I and others will soon be launching a campaign to enact the following:
-- Two-year budgeting. This would allow a part-time legislature the time it needs to hold hearings, conduct
negotiations, and provide oversight to determine the state's spending priorities in the first year, while in the
second, write and pass the budget.
-- End budget stalemates. This is easier than it sounds if we enact this reform: Automatically adopt the
governor's proposed budget, provided it is free of tax hikes, if the legislature fails to pass a budget by its

constitutional deadline. This reform would give the legislature a compelling reason to move the budget along
briskly, and it would end the continual government shutdowns resulting from partisan bickering and gridlock.
-- New spending controls. To prevent overspending, we need mandatory limits on the growth of government.
State spending should not grow faster than inflation, and a 3% budget reserve must be established to
prevent unanticipated expenditures, such as natural disasters, from creating a deficit.
-- Refund budget surpluses. When the state government is flush with funds, taxpayers should get some of
their money back. We need a mandate for the state to send tax-rebate checks to all taxpayers when
surpluses exceed the rate of inflation. Had this reform been law in 2001, that year's $10 billion budget
surplus would have yielded each taxpayer a rebate of about $667.
My family has farmed the San Joaquin Valley for three generations. And my first lesson in capital flows came
when I was 14. I had cracked open my piggy bank to buy seven head of young cattle to raise and sell. I had
two choices: I could buy feed or I could fix fences in exchange for free grazing. Like water flowing down a
furrow, my cattle went to pasture where I could make a higher profit.
These are big reforms, but we need to stop buying feed to eat for today and start mending fences to make the
state better off in the long term. California commerce can again be the envy of the world if we fix the problems
that created the financial and economic crisis.
The bottom line is that we should let the water of prosperity flow again unobstructed into our state. If it does,
investors, businesses and jobs will return to the Golden State.

Dow's Liveris Says Recovery Is Delayed, Not Derailed
Dow's Liveris Says Recovery Is Delayed, Not Derailed
By Ana Campoy and Russell Gold

Facing his biggest test at one of the world's largest chemical companies, Andrew Liveris, chief executive of
Dow Chemical Co., assured investors Tuesday that the collapse of a joint venture with a Kuwaiti company
won't derail the company's ambitious transformation.
Mr. Liveris, while offering no concrete details, laid out in an interview and financial filings an array of solutions
he is pursuing to recover from the setback and strengthen Dow's financial position. They include pursuing
legal remedies against its former partner for abandoning the $17.4 billion deal, selling assets to raise cash
and seeking new partners for a joint venture.
But questions about Dow's planned $15.3 billion acquisition of specialty chemicals maker Rohm &Haas Co.
continued to dog Mr. Liveris, with analysts suggesting the purchase could overburden Dow as the global
economy has sent demand for its plastics plunging.
"The balance sheet will definitely be very stretched" if Dow goes ahead with the deal, said HSBC analyst
Hassan Ahmed.
Another major chemical manufacturer, privately held LyondellBasell Industries, said two of its units filed for
bankruptcy protection Tuesday after sinking revenue left it unable to manage a heavy debt load. Dutch
chemicals maker Basell International Holdings in 2007 paid a premium of about 20% to buy Houston-based
Lyondell Chemical.
Mr. Liveris on Tuesday declined to elaborate on the status of Dow's Rohm &Haas acquisition or say whether
the company is set to close the deal early this year as planned. He reassured investors that maintaining the
company's investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and that Dow will continue to pay its dividend as it has
done for 96 years without any reduction.
Dow executives have previously said the Rohm &Haas acquisition is not contingent on the $9 billion in cash it
would have obtained by closing the Kuwait joint venture. Dow has secured a $13 billion short-term loan from
a group of banks and $4 billion in other financing that it says will help fund the acquisition. Many of those
bankers said Tuesday they remain committed to providing the money for the deal, which must close by the
end of this week to avoid incurring extra costs.
"One should assume that Rohm &Haas is in our future," Mr. Liveris said in an interview. "Now having said
that, we've just had a material event and we're in the middle of a regulatory situation, so . . . I don't want to
make any announcement or add to any speculation on Rohm &Haas."
A Rohm &Haas spokesman said Tuesday that the company continues to work toward closing the deal in
early 2009.
Dow's agreement with Rohm &Haas doesn't allow it to back out by paying a cancelation penalty. Rather, Dow
will have to pay a steep price, raising its $78-a-share offer by 1.7 cents a day, if it delays past January 10.
Any delay would increase the cost of the acquisition by about $3 million a day, according to calculations
based on a company filing.
Kuwait's 11th-hour decision to pull out of the joint venture dealt a heavy blow to Mr. Liveris's strategic plans
for Dow. Since taking over as CEO in 2004, Mr. Liveris, who spent most of his 32-year Dow career in Asia,
had concentrated on transforming the 112-year-old Dow from a manufacturer of low-profit bulk chemicals to a
cutting edge growth company.
His blueprint relied on paring the company's low-margin commodity-chemicals business by taking partners in
regions where the oil and natural gas that fed Dow's petrochemical plants is cheaper, while freeing up cash to
invest in more profitable specialty chemicals.

--- Page 82 ---

Mr. Liveris had conceived the Kuwait joint venture in late 2007 as the repository for much of the company's
highly cyclical commodity chemicals. The deal also would have provided Dow with cash to help fund the
cornerstone of Mr. Liveris's transformation plan: the purchase of Rohm &Haas.
On Tuesday, he said the company is currently in talks with two interested parties that could replace its
original partner, Petrochemical Industries Co., in the first half of the year. Dow has not identified those
potential partners.
Dow also will accelerate thousands of job cuts and plant closures, announced in December, and further trim
its capital spending. The company plans to put several commodity-chemical assets on the block that could
yield several billions of dollars, according to Mr. Liveris.
Dow's plan is not without risks given the dismal state of business in the chemical sector and tight credit
conditions, analysts say. Oil prices have also plunged, drying up income for oil-rich nations that could replace
Kuwait as a partner. Fighting for legal compensation could complicate Dow's current partnerships and tarnish
its reputation in the Middle East.
Dow also faces a huge bill from another major joint venture with a Middle East partner: about $10 billion from
its share of a new petrochemical complex in Saudi Arabia.
And despite Mr. Liveris's assurances, some analysts are worried Dow might have to reduce its dividend if it
buys Rohm &Haas acquisition and is unable to quickly replace the Kuwaiti deal.
"It's a risky strategy," said Michael Judd, analyst with Greenwich Consultants LLC.
Dow's investors are already paying the price. Since the beginning of October, Dow's stock has fallen more
than 50% to a low of $15.05 Monday. It climbed 6.6%, to $16.05, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange trading
after Mr. Liveris's announcement.
Dow's dire situation is all the more striking because Mr. Liveris had foreseen the nation's deteriorating
economy. In June, he predicted tough times would last through 2009. Soon afterwards, he announced a new
round of plant closings and job cuts to prepare for leaner times.
"He gambled the entire company on this deal and that is foolhardy," said Philip Leighton, director of
petrochemicals for London-based Jacobs Consultancy.

Commodities
Look Around
For Inflation
With inflation an open question for 2009, the market will hear this week from two companies that thrived
when prices rose in 2008.
Fertilizer maker Mosaic is due to report quarterly earnings after the closing bell on Monday and confer with
investors and analysts Tuesday morning.
Seed maker Monsanto's results are due before Wednesday's open.
Analysts, on average, expect Mosaic to earn $1.43 a share, up 73% from a year ago. They expect Monsanto
to earn 59 cents a share, up 28% from the prior year.
Both companies were poster children of an inflationary boom that last year went spectacularly bust.
When inflation soars, as it did for much of 2008, it makes great investments of the stuff that is rising in price,
including commodities and the companies that help produce them.
Mosaic and Monsanto rose in 2007 and the first half of 2008, as ethanol demand and improving diets in
emerging markets resulted in a frenzied rush for agricultural products.
At one point last summer, Monsanto was up about 170% from the end of 2006, while Mosaic was up about
650%. Both stocks sank as oil and other commodity prices tumbled, along with inflation, in late 2008.
Still, investors who bought both companies at the end of 2006 are sitting on healthy gains, unlike index
investors in the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index.
And recently the trend seems to have turned back in their favor. Mosaic is up 65% from its Nov. 20 low, and
Monsanto is up 11%.
Other inflation plays are gaining, too: Crude oil has bounced nearly 37% since bottoming on Dec. 19. Gold
futures are up 17% in the past month.
From one perspective, now seems a prime second chance for investors who missed the last commodities
joyride. Some fret that stimulus-happy governments from Washington to Beijing are stoking another
inflationary run that will begin by 2010.
Trouble is, inflation is nowhere in sight. Quite the opposite: The Institute for Supply Management last week
reported that a measure of prices paid by U.S. factories plunged in December to its lowest level since 1949.
For consumers, prices for retail goods and services, gasoline, cars and homes are still tumbling. Inflation
excluding food and energy stayed tame throughout 2008.
Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, expects the Labor Department's consumer price
index to end 2009 just 0.4% higher than at the end of 2008, the weakest inflation since 1955, after spending
most of the year in negative territory.
Indeed, every quarter in which gross domestic product shrinks or grows below its potential only increases the
slack in the economy.

It could take years to mop up that slack, meaning less fuel for inflation and anemic returns on
inflation-friendly investments.

Investing in Funds: A Quarterly Analysis --- The 'Alternatives' Route Was Tough Going In 2008 ---
Holdings such as real estate and commodities failed to smooth the ride for investors in a rocky year
for stocks and bonds

As the market crashed last year, investors learned a hard lesson: Efforts to cushion losses don't always work.
Over the past few years, investors and financial advisers have been pouring more and more money into
commodities, real estate and other vehicles that were once niches for the well-to-do. The idea? These
"alternative" investments were supposed to diversify their portfolios and cushion the shock when stocks and
bonds took a dive.
That's the theory, anyway. But last year, commodities, real estate and other alternatives fell along with the
stock and bond markets. For instance, mutual funds that invest in real estate and commodities were down on
average 40% to 50% in 2008, according to data from Morningstar Inc.
Judith Shine, of Shine Investment Advisory Services Inc. in Lone Tree, Colo., allocated about 20% of her
typical client's portfolio to alternatives. But now, she laments, "we wish we had gone into three-year
Treasurys as an alternative investment." U.S. debt was one of the few assets that rose in value in 2008.
Still, Ms. Shine is keeping a 15% allocation in alternative investments, hoping they will turn around in the
future. "We could be sitting here a year from now and saying, 'Boy, that was all nasty, but it all worked out,'"
she says.
For an idea of just how popular alternatives have become, consider this: Nearly a quarter of the 600 mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes launched last year were real estate, commodity
and hedge-fund-like funds, according to Morningstar. Most alternatives were in the form of ETFs, which are
basically mutual funds that trade like a stock.
All that activity was the culmination of a very busy stretch: Over the past five years, financial companies have
launched hundreds of alternative products -- some of them much more arcane than real estate and
commodities. Last year, in fact, Morningstar added an "alternative" asset class to its fund-classification
system. The grouping includes funds that invest in currencies and those that use "long short" or "bear market"
strategies -- approaches that bet against specific stocks or the market itself, either by shorting or by buying
instruments such as derivatives.
Those types of complex alternatives are getting more popular as real estate and commodities tank. In part,
that's because financial advisers are scrambling to find ways to make money in this market, and obscure
instruments seem to offer a solution. For instance, many advisers are piling into "managed futures" funds, in
which the manager buys futures and other derivatives based on proprietary computer models that indicate
when to enter or exit the market. Many of these funds -- which are mainly private funds and hedge funds --
delivered positive returns in 2008.
"Folks are definitely looking for strategies that can do well in sideways to difficult markets," says John
Moninger, head of advisory services at broker-dealer LPL Financial Corp., which is headquartered in Boston,
San Diego and Charlotte, N.C. He says sales of managed-futures products have gone "through the roof" over
the past year.
However, individuals should be cautious about jumping headlong into these and other alternative
investments. For one thing, many of the funds that bet against stocks haven't been around long enough for
advisers to make conclusions about their risk or return patterns.
"They're all interesting strategies, but we'd have to see a lot more history before we would be ready to make
any substantive commitment to them," says Harold Evenksy, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., with
Evensky &Katz Wealth Management.

If you want to add alternatives of any kind to your portfolio, financial advisers suggest starting with a small
allocation of 5% or so. "Get your toe wet first, so you develop an understanding" of these products, says Mr.
Evensky.
Below, we'll look at the main types of alternative investments out there -- and their outlook after last year's
market meltdown.
REAL ESTATE
Individuals have been able to invest in real-estate securities for more than a dozen years, primarily through
real estate investment trusts and mutual funds. In fact, many advisers don't even consider real estate an
"alternative" because it's been around so long.
In the past, real-estate investments have often performed differently than stocks and bonds. In 2000 and
2001, for instance, REITs made money even as the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index crashed after the
technology bubble burst.
The winning streak of real-estate funds continued through 2006, sparking a flurry of new products. There are
now nearly 100 real-estate mutual funds and ETFs, which primarily provide exposure to commercial
properties. There are also 62 funds and ETFs focused on foreign real estate, mostly launched in the past
three years.
But since 2007, these funds have been among the worst performers, thanks to the crash in the real-estate
market. The average real-estate fund fell 40% last year, more than the S&P 500's 37% decline (including the
reinvestment of dividends).
Since many advisers have owned real-estate securities for years, and benefited from strong returns, they are
sticking with their real-estate investments for now. They believe that this is an unusual time, and that these
investments will pay off over the next few years as the government's fiscal measures work their way through
the system, making it easier for investors to borrow again. In the meantime, advisers point out, REITs have
healthy yields -- now upward of 8%.
"If anything, we're a little bit more aggressive," says Jason Thomas, chief investment officer of Aspiriant, a
wealth-management firm in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A typical client at Aspiriant has about 10% to
15% in real estate, both publicly traded and private investments. Advisers at the firm are planning to add
more U.S. real estate to portfolios this year, because they believe the prices are very low, and thus there's
better return potential from here on.
However, for many financial advisers, the interest in foreign real estate has fizzled, as the strengthening of
the U.S. dollar has hurt returns in foreign currencies. For instance, Mr. Thomas plans to cut back on foreign
real estate to add to U.S. real estate.
"It's been a painful ride because the losses are substantial," says Mark Balasa of Balasa Dinverno Foltz LLC,
an investment adviser in Itasca, Ill., who started investing in foreign REITs in 2007. His target 3% allocation to
foreign real estate is down to 2.5%, even though he added money to it twice last year.
This year, he hopes to add a real-estate fund that provides exposure to U.S. real estate because he believes
it's "going to come back at some point," he says.
COMMODITIES
Funds that provide exposure to commodities like oil and natural gas and precious metals like gold were
red-hot until mid-2008. Commodities had been on a tear for nearly five years, and fund companies launched
a number of funds, ETFs and exchange-traded notes to provide individuals access to all types of
commodities. There are now 238 such investments, including several niche ETFs and ETNs that invest in
single commodities like silver, cocoa and livestock.
But in the summer of 2008, commodity prices did an about-face amid worries that a global economic
slowdown would reduce demand for these products. Also, the broader credit crunch led to heavy redemptions
at large commodity funds and hedge funds, causing them to sell their commodity positions at fire-sale prices.
This pushed commodity prices lower.
Crude oil is down nearly 70% since its peak in July. The average natural-resources fund, which invests in
energy-related company stocks or commodity derivatives, was down 49% last year, according to Morningstar,
with one fund, Guinness Atkinson Alternative Energy fund, down 66%. Precious-metals funds held up
somewhat better, with the average fund down 30%.

--- Page 87 ---
Page 87 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Typically, funds that invest in stocks of energy or mining companies performed worse than funds or ETNs that
invest in commodities directly or through derivatives. This is partly because stock funds are affected by broad
trends in the stock market. (On the flip side, the stock funds gained more in the bull market.)
Some advisers who espoused commodities in recent years have buckled under the weight of recent price
drops. Louis Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors Inc. in Pittsburgh, liquidated all his clients'
commodity positions in September and October because they were moving like the stock market. He says
he's not "negative on commodities" but for now prefers to get this exposure through managed-futures funds
that may dabble in commodity futures and a fund that partly bets against commodities. He invests 12% to
16% of client portfolios in such funds.
Others, however, say that in the long run, commodities will live up to their role as a diversifier. For instance,
some advisers worry that the current low interest rates could cause inflation in the next couple of years, and
commodities typically do well in inflationary environments.
Research shows that "eight times out of 10, when equities have a negative year, commodities have been
positive," says Patrick J. DiNuzzo, president of DiNuzzo Investment Advisors Inc. in Beaver, Pa. So, despite
the recent downturn, he's sticking with his allocation to commodities, which equals 10% of the client's stock
exposure and is made primarily through a broadly diversified mutual fund.
HEDGE STRATEGIES
In the past several years, a number of mutual funds have been launched that attempt to follow strategies
used by hedge funds. "Bear market" funds aim to move in the opposite direction from specified market
indexes. Many "long short," "market neutral" and "absolute return" funds aim to fall less than the stock market
in bad times; some say their objective is to provide positive returns regardless of the stock market.
Overall, there are about 180 mutual funds, ETFs and ETNs in Morningstar's long-short and bear-market
categories, and an additional 35 products that provide exposure to currencies.
Some bear-market funds have been very popular with advisers over the past year as a way to reduce a
client's exposure to stocks without selling a fund -- and thus avoiding any capital-gains tax. Earlier, these
funds were the tools of traders and investors with short-term views, but in 2008 "the more buy-and-hold sort
of adviser has started to dabble" in these funds, says David Reilly, director of portfolio strategies at Rydex
Investments, which offers bear-market funds.
These hedge-fund-like mutual funds are among the newest types of alternative investments available to
individuals -- and perhaps the most debated of them all. Many advisers felt that strategies like market neutral
and long short should have shined in a down market. But the average fund in Morningstar's long-short
category fell 15% in 2008, with a few, like the Icon Long/Short fund, down as much as 40%.
Some experts, however, point out that these investments fell less than the market -- which should support the
case for owning them. A small chunk of the funds -- around 10% of the mutual funds in Morningstar's
long-short category -- even ended the year positive.
Absolute-return and market-neutral funds "didn't live up to the expectation that they would provide absolute
returns in all market environments," says Christopher Cordaro, a planner at Morristown, N.J., firm
RegentAtlantic Capital LLC. Still, he continues to invest 10% of client portfolios in these funds, because
they've fallen less than the market. He allocates another 10% to commodities and real-estate investments,
though he's been cutting back on commodities and adding to real estate since July.

Rewriting the Rule Book for Bank Stocks
Bad times are worse when it looks like the rule book has been thrown out the window. That's one reason
bank stocks may find it hard to rally from bombed-out levels in 2009.
As the weakening economy weighs on financial shares, extra uncertainty has been created by the spectacle
of regulators seizing banks or forcing punitive rescues, even when the banks appeared well-capitalized.
Seeing this, bank-stock investors can reach one of two conclusions, neither reassuring. Either established
capital measures don't fully capture banks' weaknesses -- before its seizure in September Washington Mutual
had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.4%, well above the level necessary to be called well-capitalized -- or the
regulators themselves are flawed, pushing for drastic action at banks that may have had enough capital to
find less-destabilizing solutions to their problems.
For instance, National City Corp., which agreed to sell out to PNC Financial Services at a rock-bottom price in
October, had a Tier 1 capital ratio of 11% at the end of September. That's much higher than J.P. Morgan
Chase's 8.9% and the 7.6% at Bank of America at the end of the third quarter.
Wachovia, which agreed in October to sell out to Wells Fargo, had a third-quarter Tier 1 ratio of 7.5%,
significantly above the 6% threshold regulators use to classify a bank as well-capitalized.
Against this chaotic backdrop, regulators are working to reform bank regulations and are looking closely at
capital, which acts as a buffer against losses. But isn't clear yet whether they are willing to make the sort of
big changes that would boost investor confidence.
One key area that needs reform is how banks manage their liquidity. Banks can have high capital ratios at the
same time as funding sources start drying up -- a factor that helped prompt recent regulatory actions.
In a securities filing explaining the immediate background to the Wells-Wachovia merger, the banks revealed:
"Liquidity [at Wachovia] continued to decline and by the end of September 26, Wachovia's management was
concerned that, without accessing the Federal Reserve's discount borrowing window, Wachovia's banking
subsidiaries would not be able to fund normal banking activities on Monday, September 29."
In theory, a bank experiencing short-term liquidity problems would borrow at the Fed's discount window and
not opt for a merger at a distressed stock price. As a result, the regulators that oversaw the Wells-Wachovia
deal should explain why that more orthodox route wasn't taken.
Maybe they felt any indication that Wachovia needed substantial liquidity support would deepen the bank's
problems and add to systemwide jitters.
But if that is the case, it means the old tools didn't work and reforms have to come fast to address the liquidity
problem.
Granted, regulators are drafting proposals that require banks to do a better job managing liquidity. But
investors likely wouldn't be able to monitor those from the outside. While regulators track liquidity as part of
internal ratings procedures, that data isn't made public.
Perhaps the solution is to build protection against liquidity problems into capital. Paul Miller, analyst at FBR
Capital Markets, suggests that banks hold extra capital to reflect the proportion of their funding sources that
have a high propensity to dry up at short notice. That has the advantage of making it economically attractive
for banks to beef up their more stable funding.
Building a new gold standard in capital regulations should be one silver lining of the credit crunch.

Russia's Infrastructure Plan a Risky Play
In turbulent centuries past, Russia's vast territory and muddy roads helped to bog down invading armies.
They are less advantageous in building a modern economy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia
has invested 2.3% of gross domestic product in public infrastructure, according to Moscow brokerage
Renaissance Capital. Western Europe and North America have spent more than 4%.
Like its counterparts in Washington and Beijing, Moscow wants infrastructure investment to help offset the
economic slowdown. For Russia bulls, the $1.1 trillion of spending planned out to 2015 represents a golden
short-term opportunity and a means to underpin the country's long-term structural growth story.
Tapping into it isn't easy. Sector stocks that Renaissance identifies as "liquid" have an average free float of
just 19%. That not only means a small pool of opportunity, but raises the usual risk to minority shareholders in
Russian companies.
Some 71% of the planned investment is expected to come from private sources. Yet while the infrastructure
sector's balance sheet looks healthy, Russia's corporations have, in general, been on a borrowing spree.
Public coffers are full, but are being bled defending the ruble.
Foreign capital hoping to fill the gap should remember that Russia's economy remains a leveraged bet on oil
prices.
Moreover, treatment of foreign investors has been dismal, particularly in "strategic" sectors -- and what could
be more strategic than highways and power grids?
Investors should, at the least, demand a high risk premium.

Is the IndyMac Deal a Little Too Sweet?
Is the government charging too little for the remains of failed mortgage lender IndyMac?
Friday, the FDIC announced it had approved the sale of IndyMac to a group of funds run by well-known
investors, including John Paulson, who made a killing betting against the U.S. housing market. The positive
interpretation of the deal is that savvy investors see a bottom forming in the mortgage market. The more
skeptical view is that the buyers couldn't resist the sweet deal terms available.
While the government deserves applause for quickly returning seized bank assets to private hands, it needs
to ensure it doesn't spark controversy by underpricing.
How does this deal stack up? The buyers are putting $1.3 billion of equity into a new bank that will hold
IndyMac's assets and liabilities. The FDIC values the deal at $13.9 billion -- the amount of assets in the new
bank.
The FDIC's term sheet, however, says it's transferring to the new bank $16 billion of loans, $6.9 billion of
securities as well as other assets -- far more than $13.9 billion. This suggests big write-downs will occur at
the time of the deal to get the new bank's assets down to $13.9 billion.
Such write-downs would help the buyers. Substantial losses would effectively be taken on the assets before
the buyers own them.
There are other nice-looking facets to the deal. A loss-sharing arrangement with the FDIC limits the buyers'
potential losses on the transferred assets. And the agency is continuing to provide secured financing on these
assets.
There is one potential headache for the buyers. To qualify for the loss-sharing, they must continue a
loan-modification scheme that the FDIC set up at IndyMac as the centerpiece of its anti-foreclosure efforts.
This scheme could be costly to run -- and may not reduce foreclosures meaningfully because it doesn't focus
on cutting the amount borrowers owe.
Even so, the deal looks good for the buyers. Perhaps a little too good

The Bernard Madoff scandal was the last thing funds of hedge funds needed. But some managers were
longtime skeptics of the money manager. Take Paul Isaac, chief investment officer of Cadogan Management
LLC. At the Grant's spring investment conference in 2006 he talked about "what lurks in hedge funds."
Without naming Mr. Madoff, he said: "I do not believe conscious, slow-motion Ponzi schemes are common in
the universe of hedge funds. I do believe they exist, and I believe a few may have reached or well surpassed
the billion-dollar mark."
He later added: "While I believe the overwhelming majority of hedge-fund organizations are honest, if of
varying competence, I believe there are bad actors out there. The worst ones may emerge from among funds
with long, statistically very attractive track records widely viewed as being unusually talented, despite their
being unusually closemouthed about various aspects of their operation." Spot on.

Year-End Review of Markets &Finance 2008 --- Commodities: Great, Then Ugly

The wild gyrations in commodities last year were a brutal reminder of how volatile and dicey this market can
be, especially when the economy turns sour.
It was a classic boom-to-bust cycle. Prices that seemed to defy gravity in the first half had trouble finding a
floor later in the year. Public uproar over rising costs was damped. As demand dried up, suppliers were
forced to make painful production cuts. Investment gains that took years to build disappeared in just a few
weeks.
All this is expected to leave a profound mark on commodities markets for years to come, and 2009 is
expected to be another difficult year. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index, a broad benchmark, finished
2008 with a 37% loss, the worst year since the index was launched in 1998. Oil fell 54% for the year to
$44.60 a barrel, down $100.69 from its record settlement in early July.
Commodities kicked off the year on a strong note: On Jan. 2, the first trading day of the year, crude-oil futures
touched $100 a barrel -- the first time it had surpassed the three-digit mark -- before settling at $99.62. With
stocks weighed down by uncertainties about financial institutions' subprime exposure, commodities gained
favor among investors as an asset class they believed would help their portfolios weather the storm.
A rosy outlook for emerging markets like China and India, the primary driver of the commodities run-up for
several years, kept traders flooding into the market. Investments that track a variety of commodities indexes
gained 37% in the first half to $200 billion, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Precious metals soared in March, in a flight to quality as Bear Stearns Cos., the nation's fifth-largest
investment bank, collapsed. Gold, a traditional investor safe haven, hit all-time highs of $1,003.20 a troy
ounce and silver rose to $20.685 a troy ounce. Both platinum and palladium reached records in March, fueled
by a severe power outage in South Africa that hurt production.
Corn and soybeans reached their all-time highs around late June due to severe flooding in Midwest, the
U.S.'s main producing area.
Oil continued to move higher amid expectations that emerging markets' insatiable appetite for energy would
counter the economic slowdown in the U.S. Wall Street firms argued that global production couldn't keep
pace and one-upped each other with sensational forecasts. Goldman Sachs Group analysts shocked the
market in May with a prediction that oil could reach $200 a barrel within two years. In June, Morgan Stanley
called for oil to spike at $150 a barrel by July 4.
Morgan Stanley was close. Crude oil reached $145.29 a barrel on July 3, a 51% gain from the beginning of
the year -- the pinnacle of commodities' 2008 surge.
Then the tide turned. Soaring gasoline prices in the summer led to less driving and had an effect on
consumer spending. Politicians proposed legislation to curb speculation in the oil markets, which became an
issue in the presidential campaign. Some market players were spooked by the prospect of stricter regulation
and stayed away.
Entering the fall, commodities took another hit as the credit crisis worsened after the failure of Lehman
Brothers Holdings. Prices of all assets plunged as hedge funds and investment banks liquidated their
positions to shore up capital and reduce leverage.
Demand for basic materials weakened as the financial crisis spread and tipped the world economy into
recession, and commodities' downward spiral gained speed. Oil hit its low for the year, $33.87 a barrel on
Dec. 19. The International Energy Authority predicted that global oil demand would shrink this year, for the
first time since 1983.

The second half's decline was so brutal that it wiped out gains commodities had accumulated since 2002. Oil
hasn't been around these levels since 2004. But some still showed gains. Cocoa jumped 31% and rough rice
gained 13%. Gold rose 5.8%, its eighth consecutive annual increase.
"It's very typical for commodities to have a late-cycle rally," said Lawrence Eagles, head of commodities
research at J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., speaking of the first half of the year. Although the U.S. recession began
in December 2007, commodities rose for months before weakening demand besieged the market.
Many investors were new to commodities and rushed for the exits when prices started to tumble. "Some of
the hedge funds had never experienced any substantial corrections in commodities, and they got caught up
here, badly," said Richard Feltes, director of commodity research at MF Global.
The commodities markets are likely to be even tougher in the coming year. Liquidity is a major concern, with
the prospect of fewer players and tighter credit.
"We may see increased interest from end users hedging against price swings," said David Goodman,
co-head of global commodities at Merrill Lynch &Co. "This will not offset the gap left from the exit of several
financial players."
Worries about credit risk will continue to have an impact as lenders may require counterparties to post more
collateral to guarantee transactions, which in turn will utilize more capital, Mr. Goodman said.
While demand continues to decline, there is evidence now that supply is contracting, leading some players to
hope that prices may be close to bottoming out. Oil-producing countries, mining companies and steel mills
recently announced massive production cuts, which could put a floor on prices.
But nothing is certain. On Dec. 17, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed
to slash another 2.2 million barrels per day from oil markets, but oil prices continued to fall and earlier
announced cuts weren't fully implemented.
The latest cuts were scheduled to take effect at the start of this year. It might take longer for demand to pick
up and have an effect on prices. "The answer now depends on how long this recession will last," said J.P.
Morgan's Mr. Eagles.

The Chinese year of the ox that begins this month could turn out to be less like a bull and more like another
big bear for Asian stocks.
Even after 2008, when roughly $2 trillion of market value was lost in Asia by one measure, the region still has
room for further downside. And again, investors will be fixing their sights on what happens in the far-off
financial capitals of the Western world.
Compare that with 12 months ago, when problems in the U.S. mortgage market first burst into the headlines.
At the time, economists and stock-pickers were abuzz with theories about how Asian economies and markets
could "decouple" from the U.S. in 2008. In the following months, the markets proved them wrong with
increasing vindictiveness.
Fan Cheuk-wan, regional head of research at Credit Suisse Group's private-banking division, was among
those who expected an economic decoupling. She thought Asian markets would remain resilient "based on
the premise that the U.S. subprime crisis would not deteriorate into a full-blown financial crisis," Ms. Fan said.
But it did, and Asia wasn't spared the pain. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index, a widely used index that excludes
Japan, fell 53.3%, wiping out about $2 trillion in market capitalization by that metric.
The region was battered by an exodus of cash. In all, global investors withdrew a net $59.9 billion from Asian
stock markets in 2008, representing cumulative outflows of about 8% of their total holdings in the region, said
EPFR Global, which tracks asset-allocation data.
In part, panic selling was to blame, as risk-averse Western investors sold off their foreign holdings. But over
time, it became clear Asia's export economy was in for a beating as consumer demand in the West
evaporated.
The damage seemed to be distributed indiscriminately across the region. Benchmark indexes in Thailand and
Pakistan, two countries rocked by a year of political instability, fell 47.6% and 58.3%, respectively. In
Pakistan, the Karachi Stock Exchange imposed a floor on stock prices on Aug. 27, not allowing the index or
individual shares to trade below the closing prices that day -- a rule that stayed in place until Dec. 15.
In relatively stable economies such as Japan and Taiwan, where stock markets have been laggards for
years, investors were punished just as harshly. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies fell 42.1%,
and Taiwan's Weighted Index dropped 46.0%. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and New Zealand's NZSX-50, two
indexes battered when commodities prices collapsed in the second half of the year, fell 41.3% and 32.8%,
respectively.
In mainland China's domestic stock market, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 65.4%,
dealing a sharp blow to a market that had been one of the world's top performers in the previous two years.
Hong Kong's and Singapore's stock markets, two of the region's most liquid, became selling targets for global
money managers faced with an unprecedented wave of redemptions and margin calls back home. Real
economies in both markets also slid into recession, helping knock down Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng
Index 48.3% , and Singapore's Straits Times Index 49.2%.
India's Bombay Stock Exchange, which enjoyed three consecutive years of more than 40% increases, saw its
30-stock Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fall 52.4% (though the market did begin 2009 on a high note, with a
2.7% rally on New Year's Day).
With stock prices having come down so far, many companies look cheap. But things like corporate
fundamentals and stock valuations didn't seem to matter in 2008.

--- Page 95 ---

"A lot of stocks looked cheap, but in a crisis like this one, using traditional valuation methods could lose you a
lot of money," says Ian Huen of Hong Kong hedge-fund manager Striker Capital. One of its funds finished the
year up 6% by making big bets against the market in Hong Kong, Japan and Australia.
Exporters across the region, particularly in the technology sector, were hard hit amid weakening demand for
their products, while property developers throughout Asia suffered as prices weakened in once-overheated
markets such as China. One surprise hit came from sudden swings in commodity and currency prices, which
hammered airlines and infrastructure plays, some of which had big losses from hedging and speculative bets
on price movements during times of unprecedented volatility.
Even with all of 2008's declines, few analysts and strategists think the market has factored in all the potential
downside. Forced sales of assets and cutbacks in debt are likely to continue apace in the major economies.
"We're not out of the woods yet," says Philip Jehle, head of private clients at Swiss bank Lombard Odier
Darier Hentsch. Mr. Jehle, based in Hong Kong, is moving his clients' assets into corporate bonds and
physical gold.
Still, a number of analysts believe the second half of 2009 may be a good time to start picking winners. Many
Asian companies are better able to weather hard times, having bolstered their balance sheets since the Asian
financial crisis of 1997. Banks generally have simpler, more-conservative business models and a relatively
limited exposure to the complex derivatives that tripped up U.S. and European banks.
By the second half, strong policy actions by governments around the world will have had enough time to take
effect. Tough times also will have given stronger companies a chance to swallow up or elbow out weaker
rivals.
"Bankruptcies provide an opportunity for stronger companies to increase their market share and grow even if
the total market size remains flat," says Kathryn Matthews, chief investment officer for Fidelity International in
Asia Pacific. "There is a lot of cash on the sidelines and once we see a recovery in confidence and increased
investor flows, Asia Pacific markets are likely to benefit."
China's aggressive stimulus measures, coupled with flexibility to lower interest rates further, make some
believe it could be an early turnaround candidate.
"There's no absolute haven in a global economic recession, but now we have to look for a market that will
recover faster, and in Asia that's China," says Ms. Fan of Credit Suisse.
In economies such as those in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, however, she believes a heavy reliance on
high-end overseas consumption could mean a slower recovery if Western economies remain lackluster.

After the stock market's third-worst year in more than a century, many investors are angry and confused.
They are hoping for a turnaround in 2009, but considering the pain that has continued for more than a year,
they are reluctant to bet on it.
At a time when some stock prognosticators are telling people that stocks are cheap and it is time to buy,
many investors have developed a "show me" attitude. Their most basic beliefs about stocks have been
shaken, notably the idea that buying and holding is smart and that stocks will outgain other assets over time.
Over the past 10 years, stocks as a broad group are down, and their performance trails that of almost every
other asset class, including government bonds, gold and even real estate, according to data from
Morningstar Inc.
So while people hear the advice that it is time to buy stocks, they have trouble following it. In fact,
professional and amateur investors alike are reluctant to buy anything that smacks of risk.
That helps explain the current demand for the investment perceived as the world's safest, U.S. Treasury
bonds, and the steady withdrawal of money from stock-focused mutual funds.
The problem isn't just that major institutions including Bear Stearns, American International Group and Fannie
Mae collapsed and had to be rescued. It isn't just that the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the year at
8776.39, down 4,488.43 points or 33.8% in 2008 and 38% below its October 2007 record.
It was the Dow's worst year since 1931. The broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index did even worse, down
38.5% for 2008, its worst year since 1937.
A big part of the problem is that each government effort to plug the market's holes has seemed inadequate,
and both stock rallies and investor hopes have repeatedly run out of steam. Given that the economy could be
weak for months to come, that financial institutions and ordinary people alike are borrowing less and holding
fewer risky securities, and that the banking system and housing market show little sign of returning to normal,
it is little wonder that stocks are struggling.
At some point, experts agree, the stock market will hit bottom and move higher. Some people believe it
happened in November, when stocks hit multiyear lows and then began an upswing. Others think stocks will
sag again and won't bottom out until later, perhaps some time in 2009.
No matter what they believe, few people want to make big bets right now.
Last month, Cleveland's Key Private Bank, an arm of KeyCorp, recommended that clients move about 5% of
their portfolios out of their cash reserve and back into stocks. But the bank continued to suggest that clients
keep 10% of their funds in cash, to protect themselves in case the market pulls back again. In ordinary times,
clients would be urged to hold little or no cash.
Bruce McCain, head of the private bank's investment-strategy team, says he and his colleagues are hoping
that the market is bottoming out, but they aren't sure. "We still see some potential for lower levels," Mr.
McCain says.
The past year saw more painful milestones than most investors could digest. The Nasdaq Composite Index
fell 40.5%, the worst percentage decline in its 38-year history, surpassing even its 39.3% plunge in 2000 after
the tech-stock bubble burst.

Volatility was startling. In October, the Dow enjoyed two of the six biggest one-day percentage gains in its
113-year history, and then gave back all the gains and fell to new lows. Four of the 20 biggest daily
percentage declines in Dow history happened in the last four months of 2008.
Early in October, the Dow industrials suffered their worst calendar-week percentage decline on record.
Analysts blamed the swings on fast-moving hedge funds and the heavy use of borrowed money, as stocks
sometimes soared one day and collapsed the next.
U.S. stocks lost $10.4 trillion in market value from the market record in October 2007 to the bear-market low
in November 2008, about 54% of their total market value, based on the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index,
which tracks almost all U.S.-based companies. At year's end, the Wilshire still was $8.4 trillion below its 2007
record.
Many analysts consider stock prices cheaper than usual now, but some fear they will become cheaper still.
One way to evaluate whether a stock or index is cheap is to measure its price against a 10-year average of
corporate profits, which smoothes out short-term earnings fluctuations.
Measured that way, stock prices are below-average today, but they only just have fallen below average after
being above-average for 18 years, according to data tracked by Yale professor Robert Shiller.
Theoretically, price-to-earnings ratios ought to spend as much time below average as they do above-average,
which suggests that P/E ratios may not pop higher right away.
After the Dow's miserable year, it makes sense that stocks are due for a good year to balance things, but that
hasn't always happened in the past. The Dow's worst year ever was 1931, when the blue-chip average fell
53%. In the next year, 1932, the Dow fell again, by 23%. It wasn't until 1933 that it recovered, rising 67%. The
index's second-worst year was 1907, when it declined 38%. The year after that, it did rebound, by 46%.
In other words, stocks do rebound sharply after a bad fall, but the trick is figuring out when they are done
falling. Whether stocks indeed turn up in 2009, as is widely expected, depends in large part on how
successful policy makers are in stabilizing the economy and credit markets, and getting banks to lend again.
It is a market truism that investors buy or sell stocks based on what they expect in the future, rather than on
what has happened in the immediate past. Because of that, investors typically spend a lot of time trying to
predict corporate profits, interest rates, inflation and the like.
But this year isn't likely to be a normal year, and investors aren't worrying about the normal things.
They already know that corporate profits are likely to keep falling amid a recession and the Fed has indicated
it will keep its target overnight interest rate near zero. They aren't worried much about inflation; the big worry
is price deflation, a more insidious danger because businesses and consumers delay spending as they
anticipate still lower prices. That hasn't happened in any serious way since the 1930s.
"Stocks are likely to struggle in the first half of 2009," warned John Praveen, chief investment strategist at
Prudential International Investment Advisors, in his year-end report.
He forecast continued troubles in the credit markets and continuing investor risk-aversion. He recommended
that people remain neutral on the stock market in the first half of the year, and be ready to boost investment
levels if, as he expects, shares show signs of rebounding at midyear.
Investors are trying to anticipate something they usually take for granted: the ability of the financial system to
function normally. That means figuring out whether banks and other credit-market participants will lend
money and buy the corporate debt and asset-backed securities that permit credit markets to operate.
As the year ended, with the Fed pumping billions of dollars into credit markets, there were initial signs of
thawing in things like interbank lending and demand for the highest grade of corporate bonds and other
securities. But appetite for riskier debt, such as junk bonds and asset-backed securities, remained far from
what it was one year ago.
Until they see signs that banks are lending again more broadly, and that companies, too, are able to take
risks by borrowing and investing, stock investors could remain cautious.
The continuing depth of the risk-aversion and fear can be seen clearly in the Treasury-bond market.
Despite the mild thawing, many investors still have appetite only for government securities. So Treasury
prices remained sky-high at year end, keeping their yields down near record lows. Short-term government
bills were yielding very close to zero, which did have the positive side effect of permitting the government to
borrow money for almost nothing.

The Fed has sought to keep Treasury yields low, in hopes of pushing investors, hungry for better returns, to
risk their money on nongovernment investments.
Interest rates paid by companies, sometimes measured as a "spread" above Treasury-bond yields, have
declined somewhat, but remain exceptionally high. And all but the most creditworthy companies continue to
find it much harder to borrow than at any time in decades.
One result of all this is that advice from stock prognosticators has been all over the map.
Steve Leuthold, the usually skeptical chairman of Minneapolis money-management and research firm
Leuthold Group, was almost gushing in his enthusiasm for stocks, any and all.
"Don't spend too much time worrying about what to buy," he wrote in a December report. "Most sectors,
groups, and stocks are down big and at attractive valuations."
But Larry Adam, U.S. chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, told clients
that while he sees hope for a rebound in 2009, he is reluctant to jump back in.
"We believe the equity markets are poised to rebound in the course of 2009," he wrote. "However, in the
near-term, caution is warranted," as hedge funds, banks and consumers reduce their borrowing and the
economy remains weak, he added.

Some years evoke memories that are seared into the consciousness. Last year -- as with 1929, 1941, 1969,
2001 -- will join that pantheon.
Though it became "official" only in the waning weeks, 2008 played out with the U.S., and possibly the world,
in recession. The Wall Street model died, and the five major investment banks are either gone (Lehman, Bear
Stearns, Merrill Lynch) or have new structures (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley). Washington Mutual
became the nation's biggest bank failure. AIG and the auto makers were given bailouts to prevent collapse.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were effectively nationalized.
Oil ranged from $145-plus to below $40. Stock markets globally fell by double digits, and a U.S. bear market
was confirmed. The Fed's key interest rate was cut to near zero. If all that weren't enough, Bernard Madoff
stands accused of running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme.
Off Wall Street, the news was no less captivating. Barack Obama was elected president. Two women were
contenders in the race. China celebrated its coming-out party with the Beijing Olympics. In Mumbai, terrorists
killed dozens and held a major financial capital hostage.
Here is a summary of news events from the front page of The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, the dates
reflect when the items were published (not the date of the event itself).

JANUARY
3 The Dow Jones Industrial Average falls 220.86 points, or 1.7%, to 13043.96 in the first trading session of
the year. Oil briefly touches $100 a barrel for the first time as investors seek safer havens amid mounting
economic fears. It is the average's sharpest percentage drop in a New Year debut since 1983. Crude oil
closes at a record $99.62 a barrel, up $3.64. Gold jumps $22.10 to $857 a troy ounce, its highest-ever
nominal finish in New York.
Regional bank National City cuts its dividend 49% and hires an adviser to help it raise capital, a sign the
credit crisis is spreading deeper among traditional banks. It starts seeking a buyer two months later. In
October, regulators push the Cleveland bank into a $5.08 billion sale to PNC Financial Services Group.
4 In Iowa's presidential caucuses, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee wins and former Massachusetts
Gov. Mitt Romney is second in the Republican field. Illinois Sen. Barack Obama wins the Democratic contest,

Clinton; Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd and Delaware Sen. Joe Biden drop out.
5 The jobless rate jumps to 5% for December, its highest level in more than two years.
9 The Dow industrials sink into correction territory as worries about bad mortgage bets and weak consumer

In New Hampshire's presidential primary, Hillary Clinton defies polls to defeat Barack Obama and revive her
campaign. For Republicans, Arizona Sen. John McCain's victory marks an improbable comeback; Mitt

Democratic side.

30 John McCain beats Mitt Romney in Florida's Republican primary, giving him front-runner status. The
Democrats' Hillary Clinton wins, but no delegates are awarded as the party's sanction for holding the primary
too early. (Later, its rules panel votes to seat the disputed Michigan and Florida delegations but limits each
delegate to one-half vote.) Republican Rudolph Giuliani, former New York mayor, and Democrat John
Edwards drop out a day later.
31 The Fed lowers interest rates by half a percentage point to 3%, the second cut in nine days, as it seeks
to nip an incipient recession in the bud. The 2.25 points in rate cuts since September roughly equal the initial

In Super Tuesday primaries, the Democrats' Hillary Clinton wins victories from East to West. But delegate

later.
8 Congress approves a $168 billion economic-stimulus plan, paving the way for over 130 million households

Biggest Gold ETF Holds Its Weight --- 'Positive Sign That Demand Is Firm'

Biggest Gold ETF Holds Its Weight --- 'Positive Sign That Demand Is Firm'

Holdings in the world's largest gold exchange-traded fund are at a record level as 2008 winds down,
providing some healthy optimism for the market in coming months.
Metal held by SPDR Gold Shares (trading symbol GLD) climbed to 705.90 metric tons on July 11, before
backing down to 614.35 in mid-September amid a liquidation selloff throughout the commodities complex.
Since then, holdings are on the rise again.
The SPDR Web site shows the holdings at a record 775.33 metric tons each business day since Dec. 17.
This represents an increase of 23.5% from 627.88 metric tons at the end of 2007.
Holdings in the world's main silver ETF, iShares Silver Trust (SLV), are near their all-time high. They stand at
6,792.99 metric tons, not far below the peak of 6,901.41 in late September.
Rising ETF holdings are generally described as supportive for a commodity such as gold or silver, because it
generates actual physical demand, analysts say.
"It's a huge trend," said Tom O'Brien, analyst and editor of Gold Report newsletter. "Everytime somebody
buys the GLD, the actual fund has to buy the physical gold."
That's because metal is put into storage to back the ETF shares.
"It's a positive sign that underlying demand is firm," said Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of American
Precious Metals Advisors and publisher of NicholsOnGold.com. "It's similar to the indications we've been
getting for many months now from the coin market, where premiums on American Eagles or Maple Leafs or
other major bullion coins have been very high because of the shortage of product from the mints."
Analysts described ETFs as one of the easiest ways for investors to hold gold. They buy shares similar to a
stock, and the ETF tracks the price of the metal. Meanwhile, investors don't have to worry about storage of
bars or handling coins.
"It makes the gold market much more accessible to people than futures," said Sterling Smith, vice president
with FuturesOne. "There are many, many more participants in the stock markets than traditional commodity
market. This allows them to readily, in any account size, put some money into gold."
ETFs let investors avoid the leverage and margin requirements of futures markets, Mr. Smith said.
"I think the holdings can be very bullish for gold," he said. "As they keep getting higher and people are willing
to hold it, that will provide a floor."
Mr. Nichols said it is important to recognize the gold ETFs are a proxy or form for holding physical gold more
conveniently than actually taking the physical metal in bar form or coin form. "It's responding to the same
underlying forces that are pushing gold higher," he said "It's not separate and apart."
Analysts cited uncertainty about the economy and financial markets, with gold often bought as a flight to
safety to preserve capital. There also are ideas that global monetary easing and fiscal stimulus aimed at
jump-starting the economy eventually will lead to inflation.
Reserve Yield Plus
Pays Some Investor Funds
Money-fund firm Reserve Management Co. said on Tuesday that it is starting to partially redeem investors
frozen in its Reserve Yield Plus fund.

--- Page 119 ---
Page 119 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The fund, which is not a money market fund but was sold as a relatively safe investment, fell below its $1 net
asset value in mid-September, due to its investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Similar investments
caused the firm's money market fund, Reserve Primary Fund, to "break the buck." Investors in both funds lost
at least three cents per share.
Since September, shareholders of the Yield Plus have been unable to withdraw their investments. However,
now the fund will make an initial distribution of $800 million, which represents two-thirds of the $1.2 billion in
total assets of the fund as of Sept 15, according to a statement by Reserve.

Gold, Not So Golden in 2008,
Loses Chance to Be Market Star
---
'Get-Me-Out Effect' Offsets Metal's Apeal as a Haven
It has been a terrible year for most major asset classes -- stocks, real estate, hedge funds and commodities.
One of the assets that investors might have expected to do a bit better in such an environment was gold. But
gold's performance this year has been a disappointment.
As of Friday, gold closed at $870.40 a troy ounce, up 4.3% on the year. Compared with a 41% decline in the
Standard &Poor's 500-stock index and a 61% drop in crude oil, that is just fine; it is, after all, a return of
capital. But analysts said gold failed to capitalize during market turmoil because for much of the year, gold
was as much a part of the craze as any other asset.
"We weren't necessarily seeing the rush to safety of this safe-haven market that gold has been in the past,"
said Darin Newsom, senior commodities analyst at DTN, a business-information provider. "We were seeing a
get-me-out effect in all commodities, and there was no belief that the gold market was any more sustainable
than any other commodity."
The yellow metal settled at a record $1,003.20 on March 18 and has lost 13% since. The gains were fueled
by much the same activity that boosted grain commodities such as wheat or corn, as well as energy-related
commodities: an abundance of liquidity seeking undervalued investments.
With inflation anticipated to rise, gold was a beneficiary. This run, however, increased gold's correlation with
other assets such as oil and stocks, and when those assets started to falter later in the year, gold, by virtue
of its already-lofty position, failed to respond positively.
"This was the perfect storm for every prediction ever made for gold to come and vindicate its safe-haven
attribute, but it's largely falling victim to deflationary pressures," said Jon Nadler, senior analyst at
precious-metals firm Kitco.
In late summer, renewed strength in the dollar added to pressure on gold and caused it to decline further as
investors worried more about deflation. Only more recently, as the dollar has declined, has gold regained a
bit of luster, rising from $774.60 at the beginning of December.
"It just keeps your buying ability intact as opposed to giving you much of an advance," said Dennis Lamson,
registered investment adviser at Coby Lamson Capital Management in Medford, Ore. He said that the
declining availability of coins suggests that demand for physical gold still exists as a hedge against various
factors, including rising inflation.
Should the Federal Reserve and other central banks achieve success and reinflate the economy, gold could
get a tail wind. For now, investors will have to contend with the fact that it was one of the few assets that
didn't lose anyone money.

As Energy Stocks Rise, Funds Hesitate
As Energy Stocks Rise, Funds Hesitate

Even as oil prices plummet to lows, energy stocks are rebounding. But natural-resources fund managers
aren't ready to snap up the shares.
They say they still believe in the growth of emerging markets and have their favorite stocks, but they aren't
convinced oil prices are headed up soon. After volatility and losses in commodities this year, they said they
are waiting to see a recovery in global demand and solutions to the credit crunch before buying stocks.
They also may be facing a cash crunch themselves as investors pull out amid dismal returns for the year.
Natural-resources funds, which invest in energy companies and mining stocks, lost 53% through Dec. 24, the
latest data available, making them the worst performer among all sector-specific categories tracked by
Morningstar Inc. The sector was an investors' darling in the first half, but got slaughtered as commodities
prices plunged across the board.
Oil, which settled at $37.71 a barrel Friday, hit a peak of $145.29 a barrel in early July. It fell to $33.87 last
Friday, the lowest price in nearly five years. Coal prices peaked at about $130 a ton in July, triple the price in
2004, before falling back to about $62 Friday.
Meanwhile, some energy stocks are rising. Although oil prices have fallen 14% in the past seven trading days
despite a production cut announced earlier in the month by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, investors buying the shares are betting that oil prices are heading up over the longer term. Energy
Select Sector SPDR, a benchmark exchange-traded fund tracking energy stocks, is up 13% since its Nov. 20
low. Exxon Mobil Corp. is up 13% over the same period and has gained 24% since its low for the year in
October.
Natural-resources funds, meanwhile, posted a loss of 3% over the past four weeks as of Dec. 24, according
to Morningstar.
Investors withdrew more than $7 billion from these funds between July and November, Morningstar
estimates. Including investment losses, assets under management shrank from $98.5 billion to $37.7 billion
over the same period.
"Redemptions at many funds have picked up considerably," said Michael Herbst, an analyst with Morningstar,
"so managers may be inclined to hold above-normal cash positions to meet those redemptions." These funds
typically keep a 5% stake in cash, he said.
Daniel Rice, manager of the BlackRock Global Resources Fund, said he is taking "a wait-and-see attitude" to
buying energy stocks.
He says he thinks the market's view of commodities is too bleak, but he acknowledges that his long-term
price target of $90 a barrel for oil, which is based on the assumption that the global economy expands 2% to
3% a year, depends on easier credit and the possibility of government spending on big infrastructure projects
to boost demand.
His fund, whose 10-year average annual return of 17% puts it among the top-performing natural-resources
funds tracked by Lipper Inc., has lost 58% this year. For the first half, the fund was up 46% and assets
ballooned to $1.8 billion. It now has just $450 million due to declining share prices and investors' withdrawals.
"It has been a complete roller coaster," said Mr. Rice, who has been running the fund since its inception in
1990.
The $555 million Van Eck Global Hard Assets Fund, down 49% this year, has maintained a 10% to 15% cash
stake in its portfolio since August.

--- Page 122 ---
Page 122 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Derek van Eck, the portfolio manager, said he has been gradually increasing the fund's holdings of gold, to
17% from 8%, buying both mining stocks and gold exchange-traded funds, betting that gold, as a hedge
against inflation, will outperform other commodities amid the economic turmoil.
He is on the fence about energy stocks. He uses U.S. gasoline consumption as a "leading indicator" to gauge
energy demand, and recent reports showed an increase since late November, before falling again in the
week ended Dec. 19.
"We're beginning to get a little bit more positive on commodities, but you need some degree of demand
stabilization before prices stabilize," he said.
This year's top performer in Lipper's natural-resources category, the $372.7 million ICON Energy Fund, has
stayed away from the oil-price guessing game. The fund uses quantitative models to pick stocks instead of
relying only on macroeconomic views, said portfolio manager Derek Rollingson. It has lost 37% this year.
BlackRock's Mr. Rice made his name with his early bets on coal, the cheapest fossil fuel. He started moving
into coal stocks in 2004, betting that coal demand was going to be much stronger than people had
anticipated.
Last spring, his two top coal holdings, Consol Energy Inc. and Massey Energy Co., had risen so much that
each exceeded 10% of the fund's assets and triggered a selling order, based on BlackRock Inc.'s internal risk
guidelines.
The fund trimmed holdings of the two coal producers in May and June at prices close to their all-time highs,
which were hit in June.
He isn't buying more, but still has a large position in those stocks.
They have taken a beating recently as hedge funds, which had snapped up lots of coal-mining stocks over
the years, rushed for the exits amid redemptions and margin calls. Consol Energy has fallen 76% and
Massey is off 86% from their all-time highs.
"Our love for coal was that this is the very top of the commodity mountain, and it will take a tsunami of bad
economic events to wash over the top to affect coal," he said, "Now it looks like it is washing over the top."

The Uncrowned King
By Kenneth Whyte
Counterpoint, 546 pages, $30
It is said that we are witnessing the not-so-slow demise of the newspaper industry. Circulation is down, even
at the most respected dailies, and ad revenues are flat or falling. The Internet -- that's where people get their
news nowadays. The old paper-and-ink model has been blown apart, and in its place has come a faster form
of word distribution.
Ah, but there was a time -- not so long ago in the grand scheme of things -- when people not only read
newspapers but waited with bated breath for the latest edition to hit the street. A time when journalism was
the wild realm of a lionhearted few and newspaper publishers wielded the power of kings. One need travel
back only a century or so to witness the noisy birth of the modern newspaper that so many have now
consigned to the grave.
In 1895, William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951) arrived in New York City from his family home in San
Francisco to assume the position of owner and publisher of the New York Morning Journal, a name he
immediately shortened to the New York Journal. Once Hearst was installed in his Park Row office, he soon
leapt into national prominence; how he managed this breakthrough is the subject of Kenneth Whyte's "The
Uncrowned King," an engaging chronicle of Hearst's first three years in New York.
Only a dozen years before his Manhattan arrival (and fresh from a Harvard expulsion) Hearst had taken his
first baby steps in journalism, persuading his father, Sen. George Hearst, to let him run the family's San
Francisco Examiner. Hearst quickly turned the Examiner into that city's most popular daily. A hotel fire
prompted a 14-page special section in the Examiner "with eye-witness accounts, oversized headlines, and
massive (for the time) three- and four-column pictures," Mr. Whyte notes. Reporters ginned up stories -- one
"threw himself over the side of the Oakland ferry to prove local authorities incapable of a timely rescue."
Hearst even attacked, as he promised he would, his father's friends, including Collis Potter Huntington, the
head of the Southern Pacific Railroad and, according to the Examiner, the proprietor of a monopolistic and
incompetent enterprise. Hearst promoted the Examiner's new swagger with marching bands, oyster suppers,
fireworks displays and free boat rides.
After shopping around for a New York paper for nearly a year, Hearst bought the Journal. When he assumed
control of the paper, there were 17 major dailies in operation in New York, so it would be unfair to mark
November 1895 -- when Hearst's name first appeared on the paper's masthead -- as the very beginning of
the city's famous newspaper wars. But the battle for readers assumed a new level of urgency the day William
Hearst rode into town, and the journalism industry would never be the same.
Mr. Whyte offers a sympathetic account of Hearst, presenting him as someone far different from the
megalomaniacal Citizen Kane-esque brute of legend. Mr. Whyte's Hearst is eccentric, to be sure, but he is
also an earnest general in the vanguard of the paper wars and a virtuoso of the front-page salvo.
Mr. Whyte's focus is set clearly on Hearst, but the author devotes a lot of space to the Hearst's two major
competitors: Joseph Pulitzer, owner of the New York World, and Charles A. Dana, editor and part-owner of
the New York Sun. This is only fair: Though he would embellish their journalism philosophies, Hearst was
very much a student of those Park Row legends. The banner headline, the heart-tugging human-interest
story, the articles of tendentious crusading, the jaw-dropping "scoop" (facts be damned) -- these were not
Hearst discoveries. Hearst gleaned everything he could from Pulitzer and Dana before he surpassed them.

--- Page 124 ---
Page 124 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"The Uncrowned King" centers on the two major news stories gripping the U.S. during Hearst's early years at
the Journal: the 1896 presidential election, pitting the upstart Democrat William Jennings Bryan against
William McKinley; and the Cuban theater of the Spanish-American War.
The 1896 election was one of the most hotly contested in U.S. history, and New York's dailies exploited the
drama, from Bryan's famous "Cross of Gold" convention speech through election night. The campaign would
represent Hearst's first triumph over the competition, but it came about in an odd way. The Journal supported
Bryan, even though it opposed his populist campaign to replace the gold standard with one pegged to gold
and silver. ("Free Silver" was favored by farmers and other borrowers -- but not by East Coast lenders --
because it was more likely to allow for inflation and ease credit burdens.) With both Pulitzer and Dana
unwilling to back Bryan, Hearst would be his most important newspaperman supporter.
Bryan lost the election, but Hearst gained tremendous credibility with the Journal's election reporting, Mr.
Whyte says. He reports that The Fourth Estate ("A Newspaper for the Makers of Newspapers") praised the
Journal for covering the race "in splendid style" and cited the 1.5 millions copies sold of the paper's election
edition as evidence that readers trusted the Journal even though its candidate had lost.
Mr. Whyte devotes nearly half of "The Uncrowned King" to the Spanish-American War, specifically the
dueling among the major dailies to secure news from Cuba. This was America's first post-Civil War fight as a
united nation -- or at least it was united behind the cause of Cuban independence after Hearst's relentless
campaign to shame a reluctant President McKinley into war. Amid rising tensions between the two countries
in 1898, an explosion sank the battleship Maine in the Havana harbor. The cause of the blast was murky, but
Hearst seized on it as the ultimate war-worthy outrage. Mr. Whyte acknowledges that the paper practiced
some "atrocious journalism" during this period, but he also brings to bear a refreshing sense of context.
"Biographers, journalists, military historians, political scientists, and novelists have cited Hearst's response to
the destruction of the Maine as the epitome of yellow journalism," the author writes. But Mr. Whyte has spent
many hours poring over old newsprint, and he notes that coverage of the Maine disaster by the Journal's New
York rivals was also plenty rabid. And the paper's reporting suggesting that the ship had been sabotaged was
based on credible sources, he says. The coverage was "nowhere near the acme of ruthless, truthless
journalism."
When war came, the New York Journal landed a veritable platoon at Havana -- including, eventually, Hearst
himself, acting as his own war correspondent. Journal men were there for the major Cuban battles and
witnessed firsthand the glorious Roosevelt Rough Riders at San Juan Hill, one or two of the reporters even
setting down their pens to pop off a shot at the enemy Spaniards.
Upon his return from Cuba, Hearst found himself at the pinnacle of the newspaper world -- a successful
publisher, acclaimed editor, even a writer of some repute. But he was also reviled in many quarters,
particularly by other publishers. American Magazine sent the renowned reporter Lincoln Steffens to interview
Hearst. The profile that resulted, "Hearst, the Man of Mystery," was a scathing depiction of a "dangerous
bully, a man with power and money but without friends or a home or scruples," Mr. Whyte writes. The article
"became a foundation stone of a Hearst legend that would continue to grow in scale and perversity and
culminate in the fine but scurrilous motion picture, Citizen Kane."
But then, typically and to his credit, Mr. Whyte tests the conventional wisdom by consulting the autobiography
that Steffens wrote many years later. It turns out that Steffens regretted writing the piece because he had
been pressured by his editors to take a hatchet to Hearst. Steffens confessed that he had "compromised"
with his colleagues "to keep my job." Hearst was "a great man, able, self-dependent," the old reporter wrote.
"He had no moral illusions; he saw straight as far as he saw, and he saw pretty far."
It would be interesting to know how Hearst might have responded to the the rise of the Internet. It's fair to
suspect that he would have remained steadfast in his belief that war and politics make or break any news
organization -- whether the news is delivered on a broadsheet page or a glowing screen.

A chart that accompanied a Saturday page-one article about Iceland's financial crisis showed the exchange
rate of the euro vs. the krona. The text in the chart and its scale incorrectly indicated that the chart showed
the krona vs. the euro.
(WSJ December 30, 2008)
(END)
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A boy charged to the front of an angry crowd here recently and tossed a carton of
skyr, a popular local yogurt-like snack, at the Parliament building. It splattered on the rough-hewn stone.
He and thousands of Icelanders were protesting one of the strangest economic failures of the global financial
crisis. This past fall, every bank that matters in this tiny nation -- that is, all three of them -- failed. Iceland's
currency, the krona, became worthless beyond its shores. The country's financial system stopped working.
"We are pissed off at the government," said one young man, pausing between fusillades of eggs. A roll of
toilet paper arced across the Nordic sky.
Iceland is an extreme casualty of an era in which it became extraordinarily easy to borrow money. But it was
more than that: An examination of the nation's banking system, which collapsed over about 10 days this
autumn, reveals the degree to which Iceland was one of the international financial bubble's most enthusiastic
players. Home to fewer people than Wichita, Kan., Iceland became so leveraged and so deeply intertwined
with the global financial infrastructure that its collapse has rattled the world from Tokyo to California to the
Middle East.
In Japan and Hong Kong, bond buyers got stuck holding all-but-worthless debt. In Beverly Hills, a real-estate
developer was forced to default after teaming up with an Icelandic bank to build condos near Wilshire
Boulevard. A German regional lender, Bayerische Landesbank, suffered big losses on its Icelandic
investments contributing to its need for a 30 billion euro ($42 billion) bailout package.
And in recent weeks, Naomi House, a hospice in southern England, had to cancel a service in which aides
made house calls to give the parents of dying children a helping hand. Some GBP 5.7 million ($8.7 million) --
two-thirds of its available cash -- is frozen and may never be fully returned. It was deposited in an Icelandic
bank.
Khalid Aziz, chairman of the hospice trust, says he didn't think twice back in 2005 when Icelanders bought the
local bank. "With the globalization of markets," he says, "everybody owns everything these days, don't they?"
Until very recently, the 21st century had smiled on Iceland. Last year, it boasted the highest standard of living
of any country, according to the United Nations -- outranking the U.S., for all its McMansions and
drive-through coffee shops, and Sweden with its government-paid parental leave and other generous social
benefits.
High interest rates set by the central bank kept foreign money flowing onto the island, strengthening the
krona and making imported goods easily affordable. Iceland's ports unloaded ships full of swank
Scandinavian furniture, building materials for new houses and sport-utility vehicles. Imports were boundless:
Recently, cape gooseberries were a common adornment on the plates of Reykjavik's chic restaurants.

Iceland has long had many valuable natural assets. It sits amid some of the world's best fishing grounds, and
that industry sustained the local economy for centuries. It is a wild, beautiful place where some people still
believe in alfar, or elves.
The cinematic landscape of fjords, glaciers and reindeer attracts adventurous tourists and their dollars. The
earth's innards bubble to the surface in volcanoes and geysers -- a product of Iceland's location atop the
violent meeting point of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates.
But in the early 1990s, some people felt Iceland could be more than a showcase for nature and producer of
salt cod.
Leading the charge was David Oddsson. A shaggy-haired former mayor of Reykjavik, Mr. Oddsson was an
Icelandic character: a writer of short stories and religious hymns, the one-time host of a comic radio program
and, as a youth, an aspiring actor who dressed as Santa Claus to earn pocket money at Christmas.
He was known for his wit, says Hannes Gissurarson, a member of Mr. Oddsson's inner circle at the time.
When Shimon Peres, the Israeli politician, visited Iceland, Mr. Oddsson jokingly said to him: "You are the
chosen people, we are the frozen people," according to Mr. Gissurarson.
Mr. Oddsson became prime minister in 1991 promising to bring an end to the country's boom-and-bust cycles
tied to the fish catch. He blamed the trouble on the state-controlled economy, which put bureaucrats in
charge of fishing, the media, even a travel agency.
Within a few years, Iceland had sold off companies worth a combined $2 billion, a big sum for the small
economy, says Mr. Gissurarson.
For Mr. Oddsson, what most held Iceland back was government control of banking, which put politicians in
the position of determining how capital should be allocated. "The crucial factor," he said in a 2004 speech,
"was the iron grip that the Icelandic state had on all business activity through its ownership of the commercial
banks."
He sold them all.
Icelanders embraced change. The highly educated populace launched biotechnology and software
companies. Ossur hf, an Icelandic maker of artificial limbs, grew into a global supplier of high-tech
prosthetics. At this year's Beijing Paralympic Games, the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius won three
gold medals wearing Ossur's "Cheetah" brand legs, running the 100-meter dash in 11.17 seconds.
Industrialists harnessed the energy of volcanoes and waterfalls to power aluminum smelters. Alcoa Inc. built
a giant smelter among Iceland's eastern fjords.
But Iceland's biggest foray was into banking. Almost immediately, the newly privatized banks started looking
overseas for growth. There was a simple reason: The local economy is small. With only 300,000 citizens,
there aren't enough Icelanders to open new accounts.
In 2000, Kaupthing Bank, Iceland's biggest, had assets of just 208 billion kronur. By June 30 of this year, its
assets had ballooned some 30 times, to 6.6 trillion kronur.
By earlier this year, the three main banks had grown so much that they accounted for around three-quarters
of Iceland's stock-market value. Their loans and other assets totaled about 10 times Iceland's gross domestic
product.
Central Reykjavik has a small-city feel -- rows of gabled houses and lamplit streets. But driven by banking, it
became a mini financial capital.
Icelandic tycoons held court at hotel bars and hip eateries that overshadowed the port city's seafood shacks.
At one, Sjavarkjallarinn, or Seafood Cellar, chefs put Icelandic fish in outre combinations with exotic
ingredients. Its signature appetizer: a Mason jar of lobster, cauliflower and a truffle-flecked foie gras sauce.
Universities lured the children of fishermen and trained them in finance. In 2005, Silja Sigurdardottir, 26 years
old, was an engineering student, then switched to financial math. "The banks were really big, and everything
was going up," she says.
Ms. Sigurdardottir got her masters in 2007, and worked for Kaupthing for one year. During that time, "I didn't
really worry about money," she says.
Those days are over. She was laid off in October. Next year she plans to begin studying for a new degree, in
sustainable development. "Now I have to go back to being a poor student," she says.

Much of Iceland is on a similar trajectory. After years of growth, Iceland's GDP is forecast to shrink by 8%
next year. Inflation, at 18% and expected to rise, is gutting the value of regular Icelanders' assets and
crimping their once-flush household budgets.
"We have a major macroeconomic problem on our hands," says Geir Haarde, the country's prime minister.
To a degree, the wealth Iceland enjoyed during the boom years was a mirage. It was conjured by high
interest rates, which attracted vast sums of foreign money.
Iceland became a paradise of high returns, even for individual foreigners simply looking for a bank account.
For instance, in July, Kaupthing's Isle of Man subsidiary offered 7.15% on one-year deposits.
High interest rates kept the currency, the krona, strong. The strong krona, in turn, made the prices of
imported goods -- flat-screen television sets, SUVs -- low. So Icelanders went on an epic shopping spree.
They dodged the expense of borrowing at those rates, though, by instead borrowing at lower interest rates in
foreign currencies (Japanese yen, Swiss francs) to finance homes and other big purchases.
Like Americans who rode a housing bubble thanks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's maintaining low interest
rates for years, Icelanders had found a cheap source of borrowing to finance their consumption.
As long as foreign money kept flowing into Iceland, everything remained fine. But an outflow would
dangerously reverse the equation, and set the stage for calamity.
Iceland isn't the only small country to be whipsawed by foreign money flooding in, then gushing out. Hungary
and Latvia were similarly hit.
What makes Iceland different: It tried to build a global banking center on top of a tiny currency. So when
foreign investors tried to pull out -- converting kronur back into dollars or euros en masse -- its currency fell
like a rock, spurring more withdrawals.
Amid Iceland's euphoria, there were warnings. In 2006, analysts at Danske Bank wrote a paper titled "Geyser
Crisis" saying that Iceland's banks had grown too much, and the country was dangerously reliant on the
willingness of foreigners to keep sending money.
Hedge funds attacked the Icelandic krona. The banks weathered the assault, and the krona bounced back.
Fatally, Iceland viewed its successful defense as proof of the banks' resilience.
But the Danske Bank team wasn't wrong, just early.
Meantime, Iceland's new breed of tycoons was living large.
Among them was Jon Asgeir Johannesson. He traveled by yacht, jet and helicopter all emblazoned "101" --
the name of a chic Reykjavik hotel owned by his wife.
Mr. Johannesson, who parlayed a discount-grocery business into a empire that spanned frozen food and
high-end retail, went on a global acquisition spree.
In 2006, he scooped up famed London retailer House of Fraser. His holding company also owned a big chunk
of Iceland's third-largest bank, Glitnir Bank hf.
One of Glitnir's predecessor institutions had been the state's Fisheries Investment Fund, which helped
fisherman buy trawlers. In recent years, Glitnir became much more complex, borrowing heavily from
European banks to finance a global expansion. It financed Mr. Johannesson's House of Fraser deal.
By mid-2008, strains in Iceland were starting to show. As the financial crisis simmered in the U.S., banks
world-wide were getting warier of lending to each other.
They particularly worried about the remote and deeply indebted island nation of Iceland.
In a matter of just days starting in late September, Iceland's entire banking system failed. This account of the
final days is based on documents and interviews with a dozen or so people close to the banks and the
government.
Inside Glitnir's headquarters in mid-September, CEO Larus Welding and his deputies faced a problem: The
bank had issued bonds five years earlier, to pay for its expansion, that were now coming due. Glitnir had to
make a payment of 600 million euros on Oct. 15.
Glitnir feared it didn't have the cash.

--- Page 128 ---

Mr. Welding, silver-haired at age 32, had taken his job just a year earlier. Previously, he ran the London
branch of Iceland's second-biggest bank, Landsbanki Islands hf, and helped run one of its most-popular
products, "Icesave," a service that led Britons to sock away money at high interest rates. Hundreds of
thousands of them did, pouring in billions of pounds.
Glitnir, however, didn't have access to piles of pounds or euros to pay back creditors. Unlike Landsbanki and
Kaupthing, Glitnir hadn't bulked up on foreign deposits.
Mr. Welding's bankers tried everything to raise cash: They attempted to sell Norwegian subsidiaries. They
tried to borrow foreign currency. But no one wanted the krona-denominated mortgages and car loans that
Glitnir could offer as collateral.
Indeed, suddenly no one wanted kronur at all. The exchange rate was in freefall.
The mid-September collapse of Lehman Brothers in New York had panicked financial firms world-wide --
bringing lending between banks to a standstill. Given Glitnir's acute need for a loan, that was very bad news.
Glitnir hoped Bayerische Landesbank would let it be late with a 150-million euro payment on a loan, freeing
up some cash for the bond repayment. No dice. On Sept. 24, the Germans asked to be paid on time.
Mr. Welding phoned Glitnir's chairman, Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson. "This has not been a good day," he said.
Iceland was beginning to be cut down to size.
Mr. Haarde, the prime minister, spent Sept. 24 in New York City at the United Nations General Assembly.
The talk there was of the financial crisis then laying waste to Wall Street. Yet while Lehman Brothers had just
gone bankrupt, Europe hadn't yet felt the full force.
The Icelandic delegation headed across town to Nasdaq headquarters, where Mr. Haarde, smiling for the
photo op, rang the closing bell.
Back in Reykjavik, however, Iceland's own Glitnir bank was flirting with disaster. With Mr. Haarde out of town,
Messrs. Welding and Baldvinsson turned for help to Mr. Oddsson, the former prime minister.
In 2005, Mr. Oddsson had moved across town to another position of power: chairman of the central bank's
board of governors. The Glitnir men said they could need between 500 million euros and 600 million euros.
Mr. Oddsson didn't commit. "Let's keep in touch," he said, according to a person familiar with the matter.
There was a problem: Iceland's central bank -- which is supposed to act as a lender of last resort when
banks get into a bind -- hadn't stockpiled very many euros to lend. By the middle of this year, it held just 2
billion euros in foreign-currency reserves. By contrast, Iceland had more than $70 billion (49.9 billion euros) in
debts to foreign banks.
It had plenty of kronur. But nobody wanted those.
That weekend, Iceland's political and banking leaders scrambled to avert cataclysm. The chiefs of the three
banks met at the offices of the state banking regulator to hammer out a shotgun merger. The most likely deal
-- a tie-up of Landsbanki and Glitnir -- would still require the government to provide euros so Glitnir could
make its payments.
Euros, of course, were just about as scarce in Iceland as cape gooseberries had once been.
Within the government, a split emerged about what to do with the few euros Iceland did have. Some
advocated in effect lending Glitnir the money. But central-bank officials said a loan would be a waste: Glitnir
would just be back later for more, they argued.
Instead, they proposed the government make a large investment directly in Glitnir, in return for equity.
This had its risks. The prime minister's chief economic adviser, Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, worried that
diluting Glitnir's shareholders would torpedo other banks' shares.
The evening of Sunday, Sept. 28, Mr. Oddsson summoned the top Glitnir officials. As Messrs. Welding and
Baldvinsson arrived at the central-bank headquarters to learn Glitnir's fate, Mr. Welding turned to his
colleague. "Do you realize," he said, "It's over."
Mr. Oddsson said the government would be willing to take a 75% stake in Glitnir for 600 million euros.

Monday morning, when the deal was announced, bank shares collapsed. Rating agencies knocked down the
debt ratings of Glitnir, Iceland's other banks, and Iceland itself. The krona dropped like a stone.
In Spain, watching television at his home, Daniel Herzberg caught a news report about Iceland's banks. He
got worried.
A few years ago, he and his wife had deposited GBP 10,000 in the Guernsey branch of a British savings
bank. A year later, Landsbanki bought the branch.
Mr. Herzberg, a 39-year-old expatriate Briton who organizes bicycle and walking tours, emailed the bank to
ask whether his money was safe. He and his wife, Lucy, were saving for home renovations to accommodate
their 2-year-old, Oliver.
On Friday, Oct. 3, Mr. Herzberg got an encouraging reply: Landsbanki would back foreign depositors. The
email also pointed out that Icelandic bank regulators just a few weeks earlier had found Landsbanki "strong
enough to withstand a severe shock to the financial system."
"Everything's fine," Mr. Herzberg said to his wife.
Except it wasn't.
The bad news about Iceland had startled many Brits with money in Landsbanki's Icesave accounts. That
weekend, they withdrew some GBP 200 million.
Alarmed, British banking authorities told Landsbanki it had until Monday afternoon to replenish the London
branch with about the same amount.
The UK Financial Services Authority declined to discuss the Icesave sequence of events.
A couple of hundred million pounds was something Landsbanki didn't have just lying around. Like any bank
would, it had lent or invested the deposits it had taken in over the years.
Landsbanki had little choice but to turn to its lender of last resort, Iceland's central bank. Saturday, major
shareholder Bjoergolfur Thor Bjoergolfsson paid a visit to Mr. Oddsson to ask for a loan. Mr. Bjoergolfsson
and his father, Bjoergolfur Gudmundsson, are perhaps Iceland's most prominent tycoons. In 2006, the father
purchased West Ham United, a top British soccer club.
Meantime, Prime Minister Haarde and other top officials -- bankers, regulators, labor-union leaders,
parliamentarians and pension-fund administrators -- scrounged everywhere for euros that might be used to
prop up the banks.
Around midnight on Sunday, there was a burst of hope. Mr. Haarde told a small crowd gathered in the lobby
of Iceland's Parliament building about a new plan taking shape: Iceland's pension funds would sell some
overseas investments to raise foreign currency, then let the government buy the foreign currency for kronur.
By Monday morning, that idea was dead. The pension funds weren't eager to sell assets at fire-sale prices
into a global crisis.
Iceland had run out of moves.
Monday afternoon, a weary-looking Mr. Haarde addressed his countrymen. He warned that the banks' grave
troubles threatened the whole island. "The Icelandic economy, in the worst case, could be sucked with the
banks into the whirlpool," he announced on television.
The solution: Iceland would seize the banks. That evening, Parliament passed a new law enabling this to
happen.
The next morning, Tuesday, Oct. 7, Landsbanki was nationalized. Iceland's depositors would be protected
from losses, the government said.
In the U.K., banking authorities didn't like the sound of that. British depositors had billions of pounds in
Icesave -- and no one was saying anything about protecting them.
In a heated phone call, British Treasury chief Alistair Darling asked Iceland's finance minister if British
depositors were getting left out in the cold. "Do I understand that you guarantee the deposits of Icelandic
depositors?" Mr. Darling asked, according to a transcript published in the Icelandic press.
"Yes," replied Arni Mathiesen.

--- Page 130 ---
Page 130 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"But not the branches outside Iceland?" Mr. Darling asked.
"No," Mr. Mathiesen said, not beyond the 20,000 euro minimum prescribed by European regulations. Later in
the call, Mr. Mathiesen said Iceland probably didn't even have enough money to meet the 20,000 euro
minimum.
"Well," said Mr. Darling, "that is a terrible position to be in."
Mr. Darling's office didn't respond to a request for comment. In public remarks, he has recounted a version of
the call that is consistent with the transcript. Mr. Mathiesen couldn't be reached.
Despite the Landsbanki debacle, executives at Kaupthing remained hopeful about survival. Kaupthing hadn't
seen massive outflows from its own British deposit service (which, luckily, didn't have "Ice" in its name). And
Iceland's government had agreed to give Kaupthing the 500-million euro loan it needed.
Working late Tuesday at the bank's headquarters -- an airy glass building with a waterfall in the atrium -- they
hammered out a proposal to take over Glitnir and sell its foreign assets. Thus, two of Iceland's three banks
would pull through.
Early Wednesday morning, Kaupthing's chairman was working with his bankers to try to sell some UK assets,
when bad tidings flashed across his TV screen: British authorities, worried about the solvency of Kaupthing's
U.K. subsidiary, had seized its assets and transferred them to the Dutch bank ING.
The seizure would trigger a cascade of defaults for Kaupthing, blows it simply couldn't survive.
The next morning, Iceland's government took over what was left of Kaupthing. Glitnir, too, was eventually
brought under government control.
In Iceland, the reaction has been shame and anger. Popular targets are British Prime Minister Gordon Brown
and Mr. Darling, blamed for precipitating Kaupthing's collapse. They are also reviled for using an anti-terror
law to seize other Icelandic assets. Also attracting a helping of blame is Mr. Oddsson.
His spokesman declined several requests for comment.
In a brief telephone interview in October, Mr. Oddsson said Iceland's foreign-currency reserves per capita
were greater than most other countries. And in a spirited October interview on Icelandic television, he said it
was the banks that should have been made smaller, not the currency reserves larger.
In a November speech to an Icelandic business gathering, Mr. Oddsson rejected blame for the crisis, saying
the central bank had limited supervisory authority over banks, and that he had, in fact, warned of the banks'
profligacy.
Blaming Mr. Oddsson is "totally unjustified," says his friend Mr. Gissurarson, also a member of the central
bank's supervisory board." The currency crisis was brought about by Gordon Brown," he says. When the
U.K. seized Kaupthing's assets, that ended Iceland's best hope keep that institution alive itself.
Mr. Brown has vigorously defended Britain's moves, saying they were necessary to protect British savers
after Iceland signaled it would back local depositors but not foreigners.
Iceland's Global Fallout
One thing that might have saved Icelandic capitalism was joining the euro. Appealing to national pride, Mr.
Oddsson long resisted moves to join the European Union and adopt the common currency. Perhaps most
crucially, joining the EU would have meant bureaucrats in Brussels would then regulate Iceland's use of its
fishing stocks -- a political third rail in Iceland.
In the October TV interview, Mr. Oddsson was unbowed in his views of the euro. "If we were tied to the euro,
for instance, we would just have to succumb to the laws of Germany and France," he said.
The growth of Iceland's banks abroad was astonishing. When they fell, they left a mess to clean up that spills
across the globe.
Glitnir owned two Norwegian banks. Landsbanki took deposits across the Atlantic in Nova Scotia -- then
spread halfway across Canada to open a private-banking office in Winnipeg.
Kaupthing launched operations in Luxembourg, and raised an investment fund and bought a power plant in
India. Two weeks before it collapsed, Kaupthing also wooed a Qatari sheikh, Mohammed Bin Khalifa
Al-Thani, into buying a 5% bank stake for 25.6 billion kronur. A spokeswoman says the stake is now virtually
worthless.

Kaupthing also hired a real-estate banker to drum up business. Among the resulting projects was the Beverly
Hills condo development. Kaupthing teamed up with land developer CPC Group, and borrowed $365 million
to help finance the purchase of eight acres of land abutting Wilshire Boulevard.
The loan was due Oct. 9 -- the day Kaupthing was seized by Iceland. CPC was unable to make the whole
payment. The project is in turmoil.
In most countries, deposit-protection schemes cover at least some money lost by savers, at significant cost to
local treasuries. Britain and the Netherlands are putting up billions of euros to cover their depositors. Iceland
will reimburse some funds, but not for years.
Mr. Herzberg and the 2,000 other depositors in Landsbanki Guernsey have been paid 30% of their GBP 120
million in deposits. But the bank's court-appointed administrator isn't optimistic that they'll get the rest back.
Guernsey has no deposit-guarantee protection.
Account holders with large balances, like Naomi House, the British children's hospice, are out of luck. Some
250 children suffering from cancer and other diseases come to Naomi House each year. Many pass through
its doors only for a temporary stay. Others come there to die.
In better times -- in fact, just three years ago -- Naomi house decided to start building a second facility, for
teenagers. Construction isn't finished, so to keep the project going, Mr. Aziz, the charity's chairman, says the
trust may be forced to sell its stocks and other investments.
Mr. Aziz hopes the government can help his charity, given that it is spending billions on bank bailouts.
"Against the eye-watering sums that are being bandied around," Mr. Aziz says, "this is nothing."

Retail Sales Plummet --- Discounts Don't Revive Holiday Spending; High-End Walloped
Retail Sales Plummet --- Discounts Don't Revive Holiday Spending; High-End Walloped

Price-slashing failed to rescue a bleak holiday season for beleaguered retailers, as sales plunged across
most categories on shrinking consumer spending, according to new data released Thursday.
Despite a flurry of last-minute shoppers lured by the deep discounts, total retail sales, excluding automobiles,
fell over the year-earlier period by 5.5% in November and 8% in December through Christmas Eve, according
to MasterCard Inc.'s SpendingPulse unit.
When gasoline sales are excluded, the fall in overall retail sales is more modest: a 2.5% drop in November
and a 4% decline in December. A 40% drop in gasoline prices over the year-earlier period contributed to the
sharp decline in total sales.
But considering individual sectors, "This will go down as the one of the worst holiday sales seasons on
record," said Mary Delk, a director in the retail practice at consulting firm Deloitte LLP. "Retailers went from
'Ho-ho' to 'Uh-oh' to 'Oh-no.'"
The holiday retail-sales decline was much worse than the already-dire picture painted by industry forecasts,
which had predicted sales ranging from a 1% drop to a more optimistic increase of 2.2%.
Luxury goods, once considered immune from economic turmoil, were hardest hit, with sales falling 21.2%,
compared with a jump of 7.5% a year ago, when the economy had just begun to sputter. Including jewelry
sales, the luxury sector plunged by a whopping 34.5%.
During the same period last year, overall retail sales rose a modest 2.4%, helped by late-season discounting
that enticed procrastinating shoppers. But this year, after a moderate uptick in shopping activity boosted by
steep promotions the Friday after Thanksgiving, shoppers closed their wallets and reopened them only
cautiously, worried by job losses, a sinking stock market and a recession climbing into its second year.
"There has been a major contraction in consumer spending," Michael McNamara, vice president of research
and analysis for MasterCard Advisors, said in an interview yesterday.
This spells a bitter disappointment for companies that had hoped the holidays would offset a year when sales
have been sliding steadily, draining profits and, in many instances, undermining the ability to pay down debt.
The industry already has seen a parade of retailers entering bankruptcy proceedings, such as Circuit City
Stores Inc., and liquidating, including Mervyn's LLC and Linens 'N Things Inc. The weak holiday sales mean
more chains are likely to follow suit next year.
To be sure, there was a glimmer of positive economic news this week as well, as the Labor Department
released figures showing inflation-adjusted consumer spending inched up slightly in November as gas prices
fell steeply. The personal savings rate also climbed in November. Socking away more in the bank leaves less
for splurging at the mall.
"It's all about restoring confidence in the buying climate and declining prices help to bring us there, but we're
not there yet," said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers.
At a Los Angeles Anthropologie store on Christmas Eve, even a clearance table at the apparel and
home-goods store didn't tempt Gloria Langstaff, 60 years old. "We're spending less," said the librarian from
Missoula, Mont., who is visiting Los Angeles on an annual holiday trip. The trip itself was a cutback from last
year, when the family went to the Dominican Republic.
A final burst of spending retailers hoped for last weekend never came. Shopper traffic fell 27% compared with
the same time last year, while sales declined 5.3%, according to ShopperTrak RCT Corp., which tracks sales
in retail outlets nationwide. Bad weather on both coasts combined with economic factors to slow sales, the
company said.

Few retailers were counting on the holidays being robust when they placed conservative orders for
merchandise last summer. Most worried that high gas prices and the continuing housing slump would cause
another lackluster year. But even that conservative approach wasn't enough when the bottom fell out of the
stock market in September. By October, retail sales were declining faster than expected amid the steady
drumbeat of bad economic news.
No retail sector was spared. Among the biggest losers were electronics and appliances, which fell a
combined 26.7% versus a 2.7% gain last year. Women's apparel slid 22.7% compared with a 2.4% drop a
year ago. E-commerce showed the most resilience, with online sales falling just 2%. But it was still a
disappointment compared with last year when online sales posted a 22.4% gain in the period.
In addition to sales at stores and online, SpendingPulse tracks spending at restaurants and on gift cards,
though retailers don't book revenue from card sales until they are redeemed. Its data are based on sales
activity in the MasterCard payments network with estimates for all other payment forms, including cash and
checks.
At the Prudential Center mall in downtown Boston on Christmas Eve, Stephen Sweigart and Paul Heffernan
were perusing sale items and refused to buy anything for less than half off.
Mr. Sweigart said he wasn't spending as much on family this year, and was making donations to charity in
lieu of gifts due to the recession. "It makes unwrapping presents a lot faster, and we spent less money. It's a
win-win," he said.
Glen Senk, chief executive officer of clothing and home accessories retailer Urban Outfitters Inc., said he's
been struck by the extent of retail price cuts over the past several months. Mr. Senk says he's not planning
any unusual post-Christmas price cuts.
The season's dismal results have left stores with mountains of inventory to clear, prompting many to move up
their typical January clearance sales to this weekend to help salvage what they can of the season.
Luxury retailer Neiman Marcus Group Inc.'s namesake department-store chain posted its online
after-Christmas sale on Tuesday, with the message: "Savings so good, we couldn't wait!" and offered 40% off
already reduced merchandise. Two weeks ago, Neiman's reported its net profit dropped 84% for its fiscal first
quarter as affluent shoppers cut way back on discretionary purchases.
J.C. Penney Co. is offering free wake-up calls to rouse department-store shoppers at 5:30 a.m. Friday. From
the time the store opens until 1 p.m., the stores will offer 100 "doorbuster" deals, twice as many as last year,
including 50% off Ralph Lauren-designed American Living sportswear line, 70% off gold and sterling-silver
jewelry and juniors holiday sweaters for $9.99.
Limited Brands Inc. is moving the start date of semiannual sales at its Victoria's Secret and Bath &Body
Works stores to the end of December from January, according to a spokeswoman. Both chains are already
offering the semiannual sale prices online.
Retailers were stung by a shorter holiday-shopping season this year -- just 27 days between Thanksgiving
and Christmas in 2008 compared with 32 in 2007. But some are holding out hope that the calendar will
improve post-Christmas sales. This year, a complete weekend falls between Christmas and New Year's Eve.
"What we lose between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we think we gain between Christmas and New Year's,"
said Jeff Maynard, the head of marketing at Circuit City, which has been advertising Blu-Ray discs for $12.99
this week and unveiled a fresh round of post-Christmas sales Thursday.
Circuit City, which is operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, needs the extra sales. An
attorney for the company told a judge this week that holiday sales were down 50%, nearly twice what the
chain had expected.
The post-Christmas lift retailers are now hoping for may be hampered by shoppers who took advantage of
early discounts and snapped up merchandise for themselves. In a survey by the International Council of
Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs Group, 20% of consumers said they took advantage of bargains and
bought for themselves.
Michelle Culang, 26, a doctoral student at City University of New York, stopped by Macy's Herald Square
store in Manhattan before Christmas because the store was having a big sale on pillows. "Once I saw the
prices I bought more than I would have," said Ms. Culang, who spent $130 on a satin-sheet set and two
extra-firm pillows for $29.99 each, marked down from $100.
Retailers soon may face yet another blow. In recent years, they have seen a big lift in post-Christmas sales
as shoppers coming back to stores to redeem gift cards often spent more than the card amount to buy

full-price merchandise. But Deloitte's holiday consumer survey earlier this week found that shoppers expected
to spend only $151 on gift cards this season, a 24% drop from last year.

AUGSBURG, Germany -- Every day, retired florist Rita Wunderle prays for the souls of bankers.
Despite daily headlines about banker-fueled economic crisis and an alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme, her
145 neighbors pray, too.
Mrs. Wunderle lives in the Fuggerei, a Roman Catholic housing settlement for the poor that Jakob Fugger
"The Rich" built in this southern German city nearly 500 years ago. Praying for Mr. Fugger and his
descendants to enter the Pearly Gates is a condition for living here, at an annual rent of 1 Rhein guilder, the
same as in 1520. In today's money, that's 88 euro cents, or about $1.23.
Jakob the Rich was Wall Street long before it existed. He minted coins for the Vatican, bankrolled the Holy
Roman Empire and helped steer Europe's spice trade in the early 16th century to become one of the
wealthiest and most powerful financiers in history. He left more than seven tons of gold to his successors --
and a good deed.
Much of the Fugger business empire crumbled over the next 150 years, battered by wars and soured credits.
But the walled Fuggerei, with its picturesque lanes and seven gates in the heart of this onetime European
banking capital, still stands.
As in medieval times, the Fuggerei enclave is locked at night. Residents take turns manning the gatehouse to
open up for late stragglers and fine them (between 50 cents and a euro, depending on the hour).
They promise to say three prayers -- the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and the Apostles' Creed -- each day to
boost the celestial ambitions of the Fuggers. To remind them, the family built a church inside the entrance
gate.
"I don't exactly have the best thoughts when it comes to bankers," says Mrs. Wunderle. She came to the
Fuggerei with her husband last year after a bank told them they had to leave their rented home and flower
shop because of a change in ownership.
The Fuggers, though, are an exception for whom she says she prays heartily, though not on her knees. "Lots
of people have bad knees here," explains Mrs. Wunderle, 71 years old.
"Sometimes I forget to pray. But some days I pray extra if there's nothing good on television," says
74-year-old Barbara Jerger. She arrived at the Fuggerei nearly a decade ago, having left Romania in 1990
and having worked in Germany for a time as a cleaning lady.
Every 500- to 700-square-foot apartment has its own entrance leading to a lane or a courtyard, giving it the
feel of a house. The buildings are pretty, the architecture elaborate. The handles on the iron doorbells have
different shapes such as a cloverleaf and a pine cone -- a holdover from when there was less lighting and
residents needed help at night to recognize their doors.
Many of the residents are widows without savings. They say their meager pensions wouldn't get them through
the month if they had to pay several hundred euros in rent. Getting an apartment in the Fuggerei five years
ago, after having two heart attacks, was like "winning the lottery," says 66-year-old Maria Mayer, who is
divorced.
Jakob the Rich hailed from a weaver-turned-merchant family that was already wealthy by the time he was
born in 1459. He built an even bigger fortune running a silver-mining operation and a major trade route to
Venice. He also turned to investment banking and was wildly successful, securing the Vatican as a client and
financing a trade expedition to India.

By the early 16th century, he had become the chief financial backer of the Habsburg family, whose members
sat on thrones across Europe. He bankrolled the election of Spain's King Charles V as Emperor of the Holy
Roman Empire in 1519. The connections were good for business. The wheeler-dealer from once-sleepy
Augsburg was reputed to be the richest man in Europe.
Financial success brought Jakob the Rich critics, not the least of them Martin Luther, the Protestant reformer.
Luther pointedly asked whether it was God's will that so much wealth and influence be concentrated in one
person. At the time, many people believed that simply charging interest constituted immoral "usury."
So around 1520, the controversial banker set up a charitable trust in the name of Augsburg's local St. Ulrich.
Jakob Fugger allocated a bit more than 10,000 guilders in start-up money -- a sliver of his fortune -- to build a
settlement for the indigent. Within a few years, 52 houses with 106 apartment units had been constructed. A
steady stream of out-of-luck painters, printers and other laborers began passing through the Fuggerei's gates
with their families.
Franz Mozart, a bricklayer and the great-grandfather of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, lived here
in the late 17th century.
The Fuggers still own several castles and other businesses, including a residual stake in a small private bank
that carries the family name. But they aren't nearly as rich as they once were. After reaching its zenith in the
mid-16th century, the Fugger banking empire was undermined by wars and the repeated bankruptcies of the
Spanish state.
The charitable trust, however, has been careful in its investments. Most revenue for the upkeep of the
Fuggerei comes from old forestry holdings, which became a staple investment for the Fuggers in the late 17th
century after they got burned on higher-yielding but riskier financing ventures.
Over the past 200 years, the trust's annual returns after inflation have ranged from 2% in a good year to
0.5% in a bad year, estimates Wolf-Dietrich Graf von Hundt, the administrator. The trust also has a few local
real-estate holdings but no exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages, Icelandic savings accounts or New York
investment funds that have undone other charities.
Renovations are slow. Some apartments still don't have central heating or showers. But there was enough
money to repair the Fuggerei after marauding Swedish troops and their horses took up temporary residence
in the 17th century, and after Allied bombing raids damaged most of the buildings in World War II.
The lesson isn't lost on Alexander Fugger-Babenhausen, a descendant of Jakob the Rich. He expects soon
to replace his father -- Prince Hubertus Fugger-Babenhausen -- on the Fuggerei trust's board. The
27-year-old Harvard graduate recently returned to Augsburg after stints in London with Morgan Stanley and
private-equity firm TPG. He says he lost a small bundle on Washington Mutual shares along the way.
The recent financial meltdown has been "a good reality check," says the younger Mr. Fugger-Babenhausen,
over buttered pretzels at his family's hilltop castle, itself burned and pillaged over the centuries. "I'm not
thinking I can reinvent the wheel."

MOSCOW -- Russia's international reserves, the world's third largest, last week made their biggest gain this
year, boosted by a rising euro, the country's central bank said on Thursday.
However, President Dmitry Medvedev's economic adviser, Arkady Dvorkovich, said Wednesday that Russia
will "undoubtedly" need to dip into its oil savings to pay for government spending in 2009. He told Russian
news agency RIA Novosti that the oil price -- now less than a quarter of its summer peak -- has made a
budget deficit inevitable in 2009.
Russia last ran a deficit a decade ago, when the country defaulted on its sovereign debt.
Mr. Dvorkovich said Russia will fill the deficit using funds from the country's Reserve Fund, in which the
finance ministry has put $130 billion from oil taxes.
Russia's gold and foreign-exchange reserves rose $15.4 billion last week to $450.8 billion.
"The main reason why reserves rose last week was currency revaluation and the transfer of funds to
central-bank foreign accounts," Alexei Ulyukayev, first deputy chairman of Russia's central bank, said to the
Interfax news agency.
The euro, which accounts for almost half of the reserves, gained 4.1% against the dollar last week.
In recent weeks, the reserves slumped dramatically, in large part because of the central bank's attempts to
defend the ruble. On Wednesday, it devalued its currency for a seventh time this month by widening the
ruble's trading band against its reference basket of dollars and euros.

In "Is the Medicine Worse Than the Illness?" (Weekend Journal, Dec. 20) James Grant writes, "Our troubles,
over which we will certainly prevail, stem from a basic contradiction." The real contradiction is that we are
forced to use a command money -- which can be produced in unlimited quantities by central bankers -- as the
medium of exchange in a free market in which goods and services are scarce.
Ludwig von Mises wrote that sound money, such as gold, is as important to our freedom as bills of rights and
constitutions. For those who cannot envision a nation without a central bank, America's great industrial
expansion between the Civil War and World War I was accomplished without a central bank, proving that
one was not necessary for what probably was the greatest economic expansion in the history of the world.
The current massive debasement of central bankers' fiat money, enforced by coercive legal-tender laws, is
nothing more than theft by counterfeiters.

Jim Grant calls to mind a quote from Edward Gibbon's "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire": "It is the
misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate
advantage, or to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance, and even to multiply, the
most pernicious abuses."

Oil Falls on Economy Worry

Oil Falls on Economy Worry

Continued concerns about demand weighed on the crude-oil market again Monday, sending prices on the
New York Mercantile Exchange down nearly 6%.
February-delivery crude oil fell 5.8%, or $2.45, to settle at $39.91 a barrel.
Market participants said thin pre-holiday trading volume and anticipation ahead of Wednesday's weekly U.S.
oil-inventory figures also contributed to the decline.
Crude futures have now ended below $40 a barrel for the third consecutive session, a sharp contrast to the
Nymex-record settlement high of $145.29 a barrel reached earlier this year. Prices have tumbled off the high
as the near-implosion of the U.S. banking sector tipped the country into recession, sparking a global
slowdown and an abrupt turnabout in oil demand.
Market trading volume is down sharply in the run up to the Christmas break, which can make trading more
volatile by exaggerating price movements. However, crude mostly traded within a fairly tight range around
$41 a barrel, before shedding another dollar in a flurry of activity toward the close.
Concerns about slumping demand have continued to pound crude prices over recent weeks, as the stream of
U.S. and global economic data points to a longer and deeper slowdown than previously anticipated.
The Bank of Japan said Monday in its monthly economic report that conditions in the world's second-biggest
economy have been "deteriorating" and are likely to become even more severe in the near term as exports
continue to slump. It marked the first time the central bank has described the economy as "deteriorating"
since March 2002.
U.S. economic releases this week may offer little relief. Tuesday's new-home sales and Wednesday's
durable-goods orders are expected to show losses of 4.2% and 3.0%, respectively, building on already
dismal data from the previous month.
In related energy markets, January reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, settled down 8.31 cents at
$0.8862 a gallon, and January heating oil settled 5.05 cents lower at $1.3415 a gallon.
In other commodity markets on Monday:
NATURAL GAS: Forecasts for milder weather in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast later in the week put a chill
on Nymex natural-gas prices. January natural gas fell 4 cents to $5.294 a million British thermal units. The
warmer temperatures are expected to curb demand for natural gas for heating. High levels of gas in storage
also were placing pressure on prices. Gas inventories totaled 3.167 trillion cubic feet as of Dec. 12, 3.7%
above the five-year average.
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of Nymex rose thanks to a weakening U.S. dollar, market participants
said. Gold often trades inversely to the U.S. currency. Nearby Decmber gold settled $9.80 higher at $846.20
a troy ounce, and the most-active February contract also added $9.80 to settle at $847.20 a troy ounce.

Gold's Power
Is Keeping Up
Despite It All
Many corners of the market are fearing deflation. So why is it that gold isn't selling off sharply?
As the quintessential hard asset, one that traditionally hedges against rising consumer prices, gold's
trajectory these days should be downward. After all, prices for just about every other commodity, from oil to
nickel to cotton, have plunged as inflation risks have seemingly abated and as investors increasingly fear
deflation.
Yet, gold has largely traded between $750 and $850 an ounce for the last few months, and is up about 8%
since the Fed cut interest rates to between 0% and 0.25% last week.
It hasn't been an entirely smooth ride. Gold sank amid panic this fall as investors crowded into the U.S.
dollar. And it remains well under its $1,002 close back in March. But the metal hasn't stumbled nearly to the
degree many other commodities have. Clearly, deflation worries aren't tugging at gold.
Instead, other factors -- historically low U.S. interest rates, U.S. dollar weakness and the longer-term
inflationary pressures of the Federal Reserve throwing trillions of dollars at the American economy -- "mean
the environment is favorable for gold," says Tobias Merath, head of commodity research at Credit Suisse in
Singapore.
The Fed's recent actions and words -- that it will pursue unconventional stimulus such as buying agency debt,
mortgage-backed securities and, potentially, longer-term Treasurys -- have pushed Treasurys to unusually
low yields.
That development neutralizes a key argument against gold: that gold imposes a holding cost since it
generates no interest. Now, the U.S. dollar, measured by short-term T-bill returns, effectively offers no yield
either.
And while inflation isn't apparent today, stimulus packages and bailouts mean much more money in the
system. That is classically inflationary. Moreover, despite efforts to sop up this liquidity later, the effects of
unintended consequences might mean some portion of the trillions added to the Fed's balance sheet are
likely to "stick around" to fuel inflation, says Axel Merk, who recently increased gold exposure in his Merk
Hard Asset Fund and personal portfolio.
Says Malcolm Southwood, commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs JBWere in Australia, "I'm telling clients
that the environment over the next five years is extremely constructive because of the inflationary risks further
out."
Near-term gold could still demonstrate some weakness as the last of the panic trade peters out. And if the
European Union cuts interest rates, as some expect, that could boost the dollar's value, which could
undermine gold. And U.S. and European Central banks could sell gold to raise cash to pay for bailouts,
which would be bearish for gold prices. But Mr. Southwood suspects Asian central bankers looking to
diversify reserves would grab that supply, seeing the sales as "an alarm signal about the dollar."
And what if deflation does hit? Even that doesn't necessarily spell doom for gold, as some think. During the
deflationary Great Depression, "gold preserved its value," says Matt McLennan, a lead manager at First
Eagle funds, which runs a gold fund. "It preserved its purchasing power."

Is the Medicine Worse Than the Illness?

[The world ran out of trust in 2008 -- but there is no shortage of money because the Fed is printing like mad.
It's the wrong approach, with potentially dire consequences, says James Grant.]
It is a sorry place at which we Americans find ourselves this none-too-festive holiday season. The biggest
names on Wall Street have gone to their rewards or into partnership with the U.S. Treasury. Foreigners stare
wide-eyed from across the waters. A $50 billion Ponzi scheme (baited with, of all things in this age of excess,
the promise of low, spuriously predictable returns)? Interest rates over which tiny Japanese rates fairly
tower? Regulatory policy seemingly set by a weather vane? A Federal Reserve that can't make up its mind: Is
it in the business of central banking or of central planning? And to think -- our disappointed foreign friends
mutter -- all of these enormities taking place under a Republican administration.
Trust itself entered a bear market in 2008, complementing and perhaps surpassing the selloffs in stocks,
mortgages and commodities. Never to be confused with angels, we humans seem to outdo ourselves when
money is on the line. So it is that Bernard Madoff, supposed pillar of the community, stands accused of
perpetrating one of the greatest hoaxes since John Law discovered the inflationary possibilities of paper
money in the early 18th century.
Barely nudging Mr. Madoff out of the top of the news was the Federal Reserve's announcement last Tuesday
that it intends to debase its own paper money. The year just ending has been a time of confusion as much as
it has been of loss. But here, at least, was the bright beam of clarity. Specifically, the Fed pledged to print
dollars in unlimited volume and to trim its funds rate, if necessary, all the way to zero. Nor would it rest on its
laurels even at an interest rate low enough to drive the creditor class back to work. It would, on the contrary,
"continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity."
Wall Street that day did handsprings. Even government securities prices raced higher, as if, somehow,
Treasury bonds were not denominated in the currency with which the Fed had announced its intention to
paper the face of the earth. Economic commentators praised the central bank's determination to fight
deflation -- that is, to reinstate inflation. All hands, including President-elect Obama, seemed to agree that
wholesale money-printing was the answer to the nation's prayers.
One market, only, registered a protest. The Fed's declaration of inflationary intent knocked the dollar for a
loop against gold and foreign currencies. In many different languages and from many time zones came the
question, "Tell me, again, now that the dollar yields so little, why do we own it?"
It was on Oct. 6, 1979, that then-Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker vowed to print less money to bring down
inflation. So doing, he closed one monetary era and opened another. With Tuesday's promise to print much
more money, the Federal Reserve of Ben S. Bernanke has opened its own new era. Whether Mr. Bernanke's
policy of debasement will lead to as happy an outcome as that which crowned the Volcker anti-inflation
initiative is, however, doubtful. Whatever the road to riches might be paved with, it isn't little green pieces of
paper stamped "legal tender."
Our troubles, over which we will certainly prevail, stem from a basic contradiction. The dollar is the world's
currency, yet the Fed is America's central bank. Mr. Bernanke's remit is to promote low inflation, high
employment and solvent finance -- in the 50 states. He wishes the Chinese well, of course, and the French
and the Singaporeans and all the rest besides, but they don't pay his salary.
They do, however, buy the U.S. Treasury's bonds, which frames the emerging American dilemma. If the Fed
is going to create boatloads of depreciating, non-yielding dollar bills, who will absorb them? Who will finance
the Obama administration's looming titanic fiscal deficits? Who will finance America's annual surplus of
consumption over production (after 25 more or less continuous years, almost a national trait)? Inflation is a

--- Page 147 ---
Page 147 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
kind of governmentally sanctioned white-collar crime. Every crime needs a dupe. Now that the Fed has
announced its plan to deceive, where will it find its victims?
Mr. Bernanke has good reason to worry about the economy. We all do. In the boom, a superabundance of
mispriced debt led countless people down innumerable blind investment alleys. E-Z credit financed bubbles in
real estate, commodities, mortgage-backed securities and a myriad of other assets. It punished saving and
encouraged speculation. Imagine a man at the top of a stepladder. He is up on his toes reaching for
something. Call that something "yield." Call the stepladder "leverage." Now kick the ladder away. The man
falls, pieces of debt crashing to the floor around him. The Fed, watching this preventable accident unfold,
rushes to the scene too late. Not only did Bernanke et al. not see it coming, but they actually egged the man
higher. You will recall the ultra-low interest rates of the early 2000s. The Fed imposed them to speed
recovery from an earlier accident, this one involving a man up on a stepladder reaching for technology stocks.
The underlying cause of these mishaps is the dollar and the central bank that manipulates it. In ages past, it
was so simple. A central banker had one job only, and that was to assure that the currency under his care
was exchangeable into gold at the lawfully stipulated rate. It was his office to make the public indifferent
between currency or gold. In a crisis, the banker's job description expanded to permit emergency lending
against good collateral at a high rate of interest. But no self-respecting central banker did much more.
Certainly, none arrogated to himself the job of steering the economy by fixing an interest rate. None, I believe,
had an economist on the payroll. None facilitated deficit spending by buying up his government's bonds.
None cared about the average level of prices, which rose in wartime and sank in peacetime. It sank in
peacetime because technological progress and the opening of new regions to agricultural production made
merchandise and commodities cheaper and more abundant.
Not everyone agreed that these arrangements were heaven-sent. In comparison to the rigor of the gold
standard, paper money seemed, to many, an intelligent and forgiving alternative. In 1878, a committee of the
House of Representatives was formed to investigate the causes of the suffering of working people in the
depression that was five years old and counting. Not a few witnesses pleaded for the creation of more
greenbacks. They asked that the government not go through with its plan to return to the gold standard in
1879. But the nation did return to gold -- it had financed the Civil War with paper money -- and the
depression ended in the very same year.
Gold is a hard master, and a capricious one, too, insofar as growth in the world's monetary base depends on
the enterprise of mining engineers. But, as we have seen lately, there is no caprice like the caprice of
sleep-deprived Mandarins improvising a monetary solution to a credit crisis (or, for that matter, of fully rested
Mandarins setting interest rates by the lights of their econometric models).
The times were hard in the 1870s and, for that matter, again in the 1890s, but Americans repeatedly spurned
the Populist cries for a dollar you didn't have to dig out of the ground but could rather print up by the job lot. "If
the Government can create money," as a hard-money propagandist put it in an 1892 broadside entitled
"Cheap Money," "why should not it create all that everybody wants? Why should anybody work for a living?"
And -- in a most prescient rhetorical question -- he went on to ask, "Why should we have any limit put to the
volume of our currency?"
A couple of panics later, the Federal Reserve came along -- the year was 1913. Promoters of the legislation
to establish America's new central bank protested that they wanted no soft currency. The dollar would
continue to be exchangeable into gold at the customary rate of $20.67 an ounce. But, they added, under the
Fed's enlightened stewardship, the currency would become "expansive." Accordion-fashion, the number of
dollars in circulation would expand or contract according to the needs of commerce and agriculture.
Elihu Root, Republican senator from New York, thought he smelled a rat. Anticipating the credit inflations of
the future and recalling the disturbances of the past, Mr. Root attacked the bill in this fashion: "Little by little,
business is enlarged with easy money. With the exhaustless reservoir of the Government of the United States
furnishing easy money, the sales increase, the businesses enlarge, more new enterprises are started, the
spirit of optimism pervades the community.
"Bankers are not free from it," Mr. Root went on. "They are human. The members of the Federal Reserve
board will not be free of it. They are human . . . . Everyone is making money. Everyone is growing rich. It
goes up and up, the margin between costs and sales continually growing smaller as a result of the operation
of inevitable laws, until finally someone whose judgment was bad, someone whose capacity for business was
small, breaks; and as he falls he hits the next brick in the row, and then another, and then another, and down
comes the whole structure.
"That, sir," Mr. Root concluded, "is no dream. That is the history of every movement of inflation since the
world's business began, and it is the history of many a period in our own country. That is what happened to
greater or less degree before the panic of 1837, of 1857, of 1873, of 1893 and of 1907. The precise formula
which the students of economic movements have evolved to describe the reason for the crash following the

--- Page 148 ---
Page 148 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
universal process is that when credit exceeds the legitimate demands of the country the currency becomes
suspected and gold leaves the country."
Little did Mr. Root suspect that the dollar would lose its gold backing altogether -- that, starting in 1971, there
would be nothing behind it more than the good intentions of the U.S. government and (somewhat more
substantively) the demonstrated strength of the U.S. economy. Still less could he have guessed that the world
would nonetheless fall in love with that uncollateralized piece of paper or -- even more astoundingly -- that the
United States would enjoy so great a reservoir of good will that it would be allowed to borrow its way to a net
international investment position of minus $2.44 trillion ($17.64 trillion of foreign assets held by Americans vs.
$20.08 trillion of American assets held by foreigners). "It goes up and up," Mr. Root said of the inflationary
cycle, but just how high he could not have dreamt.
Knowledge of the precepts of classical central banking prepared no one to understand, much less to
anticipate, the Fed's conduct in this credit crackup. The central bank is lending freely, all right, but not at the
stipulated "high" interest rate. As a matter of fact, it is starting to lend at a rate below which there is no
positive rate. The gold standard was objective. Modern monetary management is subjective (under Alan
Greenspan, it was intuitive). The gold standard was rules-based. The 21st century Fed goes with what works
-- or seems to work. What it hopes is going to work for the fellow who fell off the stepladder is more debt and
more dollars. Just how much of each can be found every Thursday evening on the Fed's own Web site. Open
up form H4.1 and prepare to be amazed. Since Labor Day, the Fed's assets have zoomed to $2.31 trillion
from $905.7 billion. And what is the significance of this stunning rate of asset growth? Simply this: The Fed
pays for its assets with freshly made dollars. It conjures them into existence on a computer; "printing" is a
figure of speech.
In this crisis, the Fed's assets have grown much faster than its capital. The truth is that the Federal Reserve
is itself a highly leveraged financial institution. The flagship branch of the 12-bank system, the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, shows assets of $1.3 trillion and capital of just $12.2 billion. Its leverage ratio, a
mere 0.9%, is less than one-third of that prescribed for banks in the private sector. Such a thin film of
protection would present no special risk if the bank managed by Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury
secretary-designate, owned only short-dated Treasurys. However, the mystery meat acquired from Bear
Stearns and AIG foots to $66.6 billion. A writedown of just 18.3% in the value of those risky portfolios would
erase the New York Fed's capital account. In congressional testimony eight years ago, Laurence Meyer, then
a Fed governor, tried to allay any such concerns (which then must have seemed remote, indeed). "Creditors
of central banks . . . are at no risk of a loss because the central bank can always create additional currency
to meet any obligation denominated in that currency," he soothingly reminded his listeners.
Yes, today's policy makers allow, there are risks to "creating" a trillion or so of new currency every few
months, but that is tomorrow's worry. On today's agenda is a deflationary abyss. Frostbite victims tend not to
dwell on the summertime perils of heatstroke.
But the seasons of finance are unpredictable. Prescience is rare enough in the private sector. It is almost
unheard of in Washington. The credit troubles took the Fed unawares. So, likely, will the outbreak of the next
inflation. Already the stars are aligned for a doozy. Not only the Fed, but also the other leading central banks
are frantically ramping up money production. Simultaneously, miners and oil producers are ramping down
commodity production -- as is, for instance, is Rio Tinto, the heavily encumbered mining giant, which the
other day disclosed 14,000 layoffs and a $5 billion cutback in capital expenditure. Come the economic
recovery, resource producers will certainly increase output. But it is far less certain that, once the cycle turns,
the central banks will punctually tighten.
The public has been slow to anger in this costliest and scariest of post World War II financial crises. Wall
Street and the debt ratings agencies have come in for well-deserved castigation. But pointing fingers rarely
find the Federal Reserve, whose low, low interest rates helped to set house prices levitating in the first
place.
After Mr. Bernanke gets a good night's sleep, he should be called to account for once again cutting interest
rates at the expense of the long-suffering (and possibly hungry) savers. He should be asked to explain how
the central-banking methods of the paper-dollar era represent any improvement, either in practice or theory,
over the rigor, elegance, simplicity and predictability of the gold standard. He should be directed to read
aloud the text of critique by Elihu Root and explain where, if at all, the old gentleman went wrong. Finally, he
should be directed to put himself into the shoes of a foreign holder of U.S. dollars. "Tell us, Mr. Bernanke," a
congressman might consider asking him, "if you had the choice, would you hold dollars? And may I remind
you, Mr. Chairman, that you are under oath?"

Oil's Crash Stirs Unrest In Russia As Slump Hits Home
Oil's Crash Stirs Unrest In Russia As Slump Hits Home

BARNAUL, Russia -- Russia's oil-fired economic miracle is unraveling as industry shrinks and job losses
mount. Now the first stirrings of social unrest have the Kremlin groping for a response.
Gloom deepened over the outlook for oil-export revenue, Russia's main earner, as prices plunged Thursday
despite OPEC's move this week to deeply cut production. Oil hit a 4 1/2 year low on anxiety about falling
global demand, with crude closing at $36.22 a barrel in New York, down $3.84. This could spell trouble for
Russia, which has pegged its 2009 budget on much higher oil prices, meaning it will have to trim spending.
The drop in oil prices is eroding the Kremlin's ability to replenish its gold and foreign-currency reserves just
when it needs them most. Although the country's reserves are the world's third-largest behind China and
Japan, it has been spending tens of billions of dollars in an attempt to prop up its falling ruble and stave off
public panic.
The central bank let the currency slide more quickly Thursday, the third small devaluation in four days. The
currency has lost more than 11% against the government's dollar-euro basket since August, when it hit its
historic peak.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday painted a bleak picture of the economy. Since October, more than
7,500 firms have informed the government they intended to lay off people, and 207,000 workers have had
their working hours reduced, he said, calling these "worrying signals."
The government is drawing up a list of the most significant enterprises that might need a bailout, Mr. Putin
added. That would come on top of the more than $200 billion the Kremlin has already pledged to shore up the
economy, and will cover a minimum of 1,500 firms. Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach said on
Thursday that the economy wouldn't grow again until the middle of next year.
The Kremlin has tried in state media to downplay the impact of the global financial crisis. Yet popular
discontent is growing.
Last weekend, thousands of angry residents in the far eastern city of Vladivostok took to the streets and
blocked traffic to protest government plans to raise tariffs on secondhand foreign cars, which are one of the
impoverished region's biggest moneymakers. Similar protests have been attempted in Moscow, St.
Petersburg and Kaliningrad, and further demonstrations are planned for Sunday in Vladivostok.
Public anger also spilled onto the streets this fall in the Siberian town of Barnaul, as thousands of pensioners
who had lost their right to discounted public-transport tickets staged noisy protests.
The government's response says a lot about the Kremlin's growing angst over the financial crisis. After
several tense days, the pensioners got their discount tickets back, police detained younger protesters who
had joined the demonstrations, and state media made little mention of the events.
The prospect of further unrest poses what could be the biggest challenge yet to the authoritarian system built
by Mr. Putin. It also foists a stark choice on the Kremlin: to stifle dissent, or to placate protesters to provide
some kind of pressure outlet. For now, the Kremlin has decided on a mixture of both. But the government's
options may narrow as its financial reserves shrink.
"They're incredibly scared of this," says Yevgeny Gontmakher, an economic adviser to the Kremlin. "They
don't know how to operate in this environment."
Previous periods of low oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the downfall of two Kremlin
administrations -- those of Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Often, social discontent has begun in
Russia's far-flung regions, where Kremlin control is comparatively tenuous.

Russia is just beginning to feel the impact of a slowdown that economists say could take the economy from
nearly 8% growth earlier this year to near recession in the next few months. Wage delays have already led to
a strike by migrant workers on a construction site in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Such social
protest has been rare in recent years amid widespread political apathy and fear of government retribution.
Russia posted its first monthly budget deficit in November as falling oil prices and slowing production battered
the economy. Meanwhile, Standard &Poor's has downgraded Russia's sovereign debt for the first time in 10
years.
Public panic is one of the Kremlin's greatest fears. "I've already seen how things get worse as the result of an
oil-price collapse," says Yegor Gaidar, who was acting prime minister in 1992. "It's dangerous -- but people
who have not governed a nuclear-armed country don't quite understand that."
Mr. Putin's party has told lawmakers to report layoffs in their regions, and a draft law would oblige employers
to warn the government of problems that might trigger job or salary cuts.
The Kremlin has recently begun to talk publicly about the financial crisis. Before, it was seldom mentioned on
state TV. Members of a Kremlin advisory body that monitors the media say officials told journalists not to use
the word "crisis." Last month, regulators chastised Moscow's daily Vedomosti newspaper after it printed an
article examining the potential for social unrest, the editor, Elizaveta Osetinskaya, says.
The Kremlin has accused the West and homegrown economic liberals of using the crisis to fan discontent. In
a recent question-and-answer session with voters aired on Russia's two main state television channels, Mr.
Putin blamed Russia's problems on "financial and economic authorities" in the U.S. They had "infected" the
global economy, he said.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in his party have turned on liberal Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, complaining about
the speed at which Russia's foreign-currency reserves are being spent on anti-crisis measures. Mr. Kudrin
has said the money is being spent "accurately."
This fall, Barnaul, an ailing Siberian industrial hub some 2,000 miles south of Moscow and one of the last
regions to benefit from the oil boom, became one of the first to feel the crisis.
As the credit crunch poisoned Russia's economy, supply chains broke down on a lack of cash and trust, and
orders dried up at the town's factories, which churn out diesel engines, heavy machinery and tires.
Three months ago, workers say, several factories sent workers home on reduced salaries until better times.
Government data show over 1,000 workers in the region are in the process of being laid off; opposition
lawmakers say hundreds more layoffs are likely.
In late October, when authorities revoked subsidized transport tickets for more than 200,000 pensioners in
Barnaul, they gave no warning or explanation. When the pensioners -- among the poorest groups in Russian
society -- learned the tickets were being axed, they panicked.
On Oct. 26, about 1,500 gathered in front of the regional government building to protest, according to people
who attended. The pensioners blocked the town's main thoroughfare, Lenin Avenue, for three hours, and only
dispersed after a local government official invited a few of the leaders inside for a chat, promising the tickets
would be reinstated.
Still, protesters came back the next day. This time, they numbered only a few hundred but demanded the
resignation of the local Kremlin-appointed governor, Alexander Karlin.
In a third protest, a crowd of 2,000 again blocked Lenin Avenue as regional lawmakers debated the decision
to do away with the discount. Some demonstrators tried to storm the government building, but police lines
held. The governor tried to calm the crowd, but was forced to retreat.
Eventually, the government decided pensioners could keep their discounted transport tickets, while a new
system allowing them to choose between cash payments and free transport passes is introduced.
Spokesmen for the local parliament and regional government said that the unrest came about because of a
"misunderstanding" and a government failure to adequately explain the reforms to welfare benefits.
Alexander Romanenko, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker in Barnaul,says the protests fizzled out after pensioners
realized the government recognized their needs.
But political opponents believe remote regions and towns like Barnaul are the Kremlin's Achilles' heel. "They
can only control what's within the Moscow ring road," says Vitaly Boldakov, a left-wing activist in Barnaul. "But
beyond that road, their control collapses."

A Dollar Referendum

A Dollar Referendum

As it has so often in recent months, the market elation that greeted the Federal Reserve's epic monetary
easing earlier this week has turned to worry. Stocks fell off again yesterday, but the big news of the week has
been the slide in the dollar.
The nearby chart shows the greenback's story since September. From its dangerous summer lows, the buck
soared at the height of the credit panic as investors looked for safety in a hurricane. (See accompanying chart
-- WSJ December 19, 2008) But the dollar has fallen like Newton's apple in December, as Chairman Ben
Bernanke and his comrades signaled that they are willing to cut interest rates to near-zero and print as much
money as it takes to prevent a deflation.
Even after a dollar bounce yesterday, the euro is back to the mid-1.4 range and the yen is near a 13-year
high against the buck. The price of gold -- an historic inflation hedge -- has also stayed stubbornly high at
more than $800 an ounce, even though other commodity prices are falling as global recession sets in.
We hope Mr. Bernanke considers this to be the warning it is. The Fed chief is saying what central bankers
always say, which is that he'll remove all of the excess money he is now injecting into the economy when the
deflation fear subsides. But currency markets are a running referendum on that promise, and the dollar's
plunge is a sign that the world's investors don't believe Mr. Bernanke's promise.
And why should they? Across this decade, the Fed has proven that it is far better at adding liquidity than at
removing it. In 2003 and 2004, the central bank kept its target interest rate at 1% for a year, even as GDP
growth in the third quarter of 2003 hit an annual rate of 7.5%. Even arfter it started to tighten, it did so only
very slowly. Mr. Bernanke was part of that Fed, which created the credit mania that eventually turned to panic
and the current mess.
Meanwhile, the newly triumphant Democrats keep raising their "stimulus" spending target. Thursday's leak du
jour had Barack Obama's proposal in the $700 billion range, along with a prayer that the President-elect could
keep Congress from exceeding $1 trillion. As they consider whether to hold dollars, the world's investors are
also contemplating how all of this new American debt will be financed, or whether Democrats are merely
counting on Mr. Bernanke to inflate it away.
Overall inflation measures have fallen sharply in recent months, as the price of oil and food has declined.
But the producer and consumer price indexes are lagging indicators. The dollar's decline is a warning about
the future. Mr. Bernanke's decision to flood the world with dollars will no doubt succeed in preventing a
deflation. What everyone wants to know is whether he also has the fortitude -- or even the desire -- to prevent
a run on the world's reserve currency.

Investors Flirt With Risk, but Stocks Fall --- Dow Industrials Decline by 99.80 Points On Day After Rate Cut; Gold Makes Gains

Investors Flirt With Risk, but Stocks Fall --- Dow Industrials Decline by 99.80 Points On Day After Rate
Cut; Gold Makes Gains

Stocks followed Tuesday's rally with modest declines as investors considered the full implications of the
Federal Reserve's latest moves to jump-start the slumping economy.
Major indexes had brief gains during the day but couldn't sustain them through the closing bell. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average, which leapt nearly 360 points on Tuesday after the Fed announced a steep
interest-rate cut and other measures, ended down 99.80 points, or 1.1%, at 8824.34.
Traders in stocks, bonds and currencies weighed the pros and cons of the Fed's moves, including a rate cut
that may take the central bank's key interest rate to zero. The rate cut is intended to unlock credit markets,
where conditions are still making it difficult for consumers and businesses to access financing. But the Fed's
moves, which could include new lending and securities purchases, indicate how concerned it is about the
depths of the recession.
"This is a desperate move that the Fed made," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners
in New York.
The dollar fell against the euro for the sixth consecutive day, and long-term Treasury prices rose sharply as
investors fled to safety and anticipated the effects of the Fed's rate cut.
"They've made no bones about the fact that they're devaluing the dollar to shore up everything else," said
Derek Frey, head trader at Odom &Frey, a futures brokerage in Atlantic Beach, Fla., who spent Wednesday
morning making and quickly closing short-term bets on the euro's value against the dollar. "Devaluing
currencies just hasn't ever worked," Mr. Frey said.
By the end of the day, one euro cost $1.4390, up 1.8% from late Tuesday. The U.S. Dollar Index, which
measures the currency's value against a basket of six currencies, was down 2%.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to a new multidecade low of 2.665% as prices rose. The price of
gold, another safe haven, was up sharply, helped by the dollar's weakness. Gold futures rose 3.1% to
$867.50 per ounce in New York.
Oil prices dropped despite the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' announcement of an
unprecedented production cut of 2.2 million barrels, about 9% of the group's daily production. Traders had
been anticipating a big reduction and remain skeptical that the move would be enough to offset quickly
weakening demand amid the global economic slump. Crude futures fell 8.1% to a four-year low of $40.06 a
barrel in New York.
The decline in oil prices sent energy stocks lower. Exxon Mobil finished down 2.5%. Chevron was off 2.8%.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index slipped 1% to 904.42. All its sectors fell except health care, a
traditional investor haven that eked out a 0.3% gain.
Investors also digested new signs of the pain from Wall Street's soured credit bets. Morgan Stanley shares
tumbled in morning action but recovered to gain 2.3% after the bank posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.37
billion.
Other financial stocks fell. Citigroup was down 4.9%, the biggest decliner among the 30 Dow components.
Stock trading volume was relatively light as some 5.2 billion New York Stock Exchange-listed shares changed
hands. Traders and analysts attributed the weak activity to a mix of factors, including the absence of some

participants who have taken off early for the Christmas holiday and a tendency to hold off on aggressive new
bets following a big one-day move like Tuesday's.
Borrowing costs between banks slid in response to the Fed's rate cut. Three-month U.S. dollar Libor tumbled
to 1.5775%, the lowest since July 2004, from Tuesday's 1.8475%.

Oil Briefly Slumps Below $40 --- Prices Are 70% Below the Record High of Mid-July

Oil Briefly Slumps Below $40 --- Prices Are 70% Below the Record High of Mid-July

Crude-oil prices ended at a 4 1/2-year low, sloughing off the announcement of the biggest-ever output cut by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After dipping below $40 for the first time since July 2004, the price of the light, sweet crude contract for
January delivery settled at $40.06 a barrel, down $3.54, or 8.1%, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Crude prices now are more than 70% below the record high of July, having brushed off concerted efforts to
halt the price plunge as the economic downturn spreads and deepens.
Following its meeting in Oran, Algeria, OPEC said it would rein in crude-oil production by 2.2 million barrels a
day beginning Jan. 1. It was the largest cut since March 1999. Despite the size, the reduction was largely in
line with market expectations and an initial rally wore off quickly and sharply.
"We've talked about it so much for the last couple of weeks that it's the usual case of 'buy the rumor and sell
the fact,'" said Mike Fitzpatrick, a broker at MF Global in New York. "Everybody was waiting for two million
barrels a day plus, and that's the number that came up."
The cartel has now agreed to cut 4.2 million barrels a day of production since September. The 11 members
with output quotas will produce roughly 24.8 million barrels of oil a day starting in January, said OPEC
President Chakib Khelil.
Non-OPEC members Russia and Azerbaijan, which sent high-level delegations to the meeting, could
contribute an additional 600,000 barrels a day of cutbacks, though their oil fields already are in natural
decline.
While the cuts would appear to balance the market against falling demand in January, stockpiles could start
to build again as the low-demand "shoulder season" kicks off in February, said Lawrence Eagles, head of
commodities research at J.P. Morgan Chase.
"That means that prices will come under pressure at least by the end of January, if not before," Mr. Eagles
wrote in a note to clients. "Any significant improvement in prices will have to wait until the world economy gets
back onto a growth path, and works off current high stocks and the spare capacity that is being created -- a
task which will take some time."
Just before the OPEC announcement, the Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. petroleum
inventories posted larger-than-expected increases last week.
Despite gyrations on each new headline, oil prices have mostly stayed within a range of $40-$50 a barrel all
month, said Mr. Fitzpatrick of MF Global, Wednesday's brief dip to $39.88 a barrel notwithstanding.
"It looks like the market's starting to look for a bottom," Mr. Fitzpatrick said. "It doesn't really matter if the
bottom is $36 or $38 or $40. The process has begun."
In other commodity markets:
COTTON: Prices rose, supported by a weaker U.S. dollar. Technical-chart buying also gave cotton a lift. ICE
Futures U.S. March cotton rose 1.82 cents to 45.96 cents a pound.
GOLD: Prices rose as the dollar weakened and participants priced in longer-term inflation expectations, but
the metal pared some of those gains as the greenback came off lows. Thinly traded nearby December gold
rose $25.80, or 3.1%, to settle at $867.50 a troy ounce. Most-active February gold also rose $25.80, to settle
at $868.50.

Goldcorp, Silver Wheaton Are Lures as Metals Jump

Goldcorp, Silver Wheaton Are Lures as Metals Jump

NEW YORK -- Options traders cast a glance at metals companies, as the price of both gold and silver
climbed to the highest levels since early October.
Following a decision by the Federal Reserve to cut its target interest rate, the price of gold rose 3.1% and
silver jumped 6.7%.
Investors were quick to respond, flocking to the options market to take mostly bullish positions in companies
that produce and mine the metals.
Trading in silver producer Silver Wheaton Corp. was especially robust, with investors picking up 33,000 calls
that allow them to buy the company's stock and 5,000 puts that allow them to sell it, according to Track Data.
A lot of the day's activity took place in January calls that convey the right to buy Silver Wheaton stock for
$7.50. The contracts are priced at 50 cents and will show a profit if Silver Wheaton climbs above $8 before
expiration on Jan. 16.
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading, the shares were up 3.7% at $6.14.
There was noteworthy volume in Goldcorp Inc. as well, with investors picking up 32,000 calls and 19,000
puts. Here, investors showed interest in January $37.50 calls, which are priced at 90 cents and show a profit
if Goldcorp pulls above $38.40. The shares fell 3.3% to $30.62 on the NYSE.
In Newmont Mining Corp., investors gravitated toward December calls that convey the right to buy the
company's stock for $40, $42.50 and $45. The first set of contracts, priced at 80 cents, will show a profit if
Newmont Mining rises above $40.80 before Friday. Newmont fell 2.1% to $39.17 in the NYSE.
In Royal Gold Inc., investors liked January $50 calls. Those contracts cost $1.80 and show a profit if Royal
Gold jumps above $51.80. The shares rose 0.4% to $43.58 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The gold and silver rally was spurred by the Fed's decision to lower interest rates and the damping effect
that had on the value of the U.S. dollar. "You're no longer giving up a nice rate of return by putting your
money in gold or silver," said Steve Sosnick, an equity risk manager with Interactive Brokers' Timber Hill.
Elsewhere in the options market, there was heavy trading in Mexican cement producer Cemex SAB, where
volume was 10 times the normal level.
While Cemex rose 4.5% on the NYSE to $9.94, the options activity reflected bearish expectations or, at the
very least, defensive positioning. One large trader pursued a "risk reversal" in Cemex's January contracts --
buying January $7.50 puts and selling January $12.50 calls.
Paying 20 cents for the position, the trader could be preparing in case Cemex shares dive below $7.30 in the
next few weeks. Alternatively, the trader could have bought Cemex shares and pursued the options trade to
protect against future declines in the stock.
Monday, Cemex said it expected its fourth-quarter profit to fall 27%.

Crude Futures Retreat as Traders Troll for Bottom --- Oil Settles at $43.60 a Barrel Even as OPEC
Production Cutbacks Loom and as the Dollar Continues to Weaken

NEW YORK -- Oil prices have bounced back from a four-year low, but analysts and traders aren't ready to
call a bottom to the market.
Crude futures traded down to $40.50 a barrel earlier this month, marking a 70% plunge since July and the
erasure of four years of gains in just five months.
Since then, the looming production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a sharply
weaker dollar have lifted oil. The market has gone seven consecutive sessions without hitting a new low, a
feat achieved only once since August.
Oil futures fell 91 cents, or 2%, to settle at $43.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures
briefly crossed above $50 Monday.
Tight supply and a weak dollar played leading roles in a confluence of factors that lifted oil to record highs
during the first half of 2008. The mere hint of their return caused oil to shoot up after falling to $40.
But some of the bull market's former champions still believe the worst is yet to come. Declining petroleum
demand could overwhelm attempts by OPEC to reduce output, or prevent oil from regaining its status as a
haven from the slumping dollar. On Tuesday, oil prices fell even as the dollar weakened after the Federal
Reserve cut interest rates to a historic low and as OPEC telegraphed its intentions for a large production cut.
"What is not yet clear is how long the bottoming phase will last," wrote Arjun Murti, an analyst with Goldman
Sachs Group. "Global economic conditions are the weakest the world has seen since at least the early 1980s
and global oil demand is declining at an accelerating rate."
Analysts have called a bottom to oil's correction several times, and were proven wrong when the economy
deteriorated more quickly than expected. A consensus on a recovery of the broader economy isn't seen in the
near future, as recent U.S. government reports show the biggest declines in jobs, housing starts and
consumer prices in decades.
The recent uptick in oil prices came as the dollar lost significant ground to the euro, recalling the first half of
2008, when commodities and currency markets seemed bound together by the investor flows between them.
An investor can counter the effects of inflation by buying crude futures priced in weakening dollars. Oil also
becomes cheaper for traders who book profits in other currencies when the dollar weakens. Between January
and July, the dollar sank to regular record lows against the euro, and oil shattered highs almost daily.
"Oil was a safe-haven play," partially supplanting the role usually played by the dollar in troubled times, said
Phil Flynn, an analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "That all changed when we realized this was a
global crisis."
With the oil market at a crossroads, OPEC is hoping to force traders' hands. The group meets Wednesday in
Algeria, and will announce a cut of about two million barrels a day, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said Tuesday.
Russia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter, after Saudi Arabia, but not an OPEC member, has also said it may cut
output.
Oil prices dropped after Mr. Naimi's comments, as they seemed to lessen the chance that OPEC's cut would
exceed market expectations, traders said.

The combined cuts, along with reductions from other producers whose fields cost more to operate than the oil
is worth, could total 2.5 million barrels a day, said Ehsan Ul-Haq, head of research with JBC Energy in
Vienna.
World inventories will decline after a cut of that size, though it may be months before enough oil traders take
notice.
"It takes time," Mr. Ul-Haq said. "The market is still seeing an oversupply, and this perception has to change."
The imminent drop in oil supplies indicates that crude is approaching its low point, but the market won't hit
bottom until demand begins to level off, wrote Mr. Murti, the Goldman Sachs analyst.
Lower energy prices may already be helping to reduce the slide in demand. The latest year-on-year decline in
refined products supplied by refiners was the lowest since September, according to the Department of
Energy.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures held near steady in the early part of Tuesday trading in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's
interest-rate announcement, but the metal ended higher on a boost from a lower U.S. dollar. Most-active
February gold rose $6.20 to $842.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The metal then surged in the thinly traded after-hours session following the Fed's interest rate cut, rising as
much as $859 at one point.
WHEAT: Concerns about damage to unprotected dormant wheat lifted prices at the Kansas City Board of
Trade as cold weather is forecast to arrive in parts of the Plains. KCBT March wheat added 22 cents to $5.65

How a Gold Fund Has Held Up --- Mr. Eveillard Bought Bullion, Stuck to Veteran Miners

How a Gold Fund Has Held Up --- Mr. Eveillard Bought Bullion, Stuck to Veteran Miners

The First Eagle Gold Fund has roughly a third of its assets in gold bullion, avoided the base metals before
their free fall, and tends to invest in shares of more-established producers rather than junior mining
companies, said manager Jean-Marie Eveillard.
This approach enabled it to hold up better than many other gold-oriented funds during a recent downturn in
share prices of mining stocks and a general weakness in commodities.
As of Friday, the Philadelphia Gold Silver Index of mining shares was down around 40% in 2008. As a result,
many precious-metals funds were down by around 50% or more.
By contrast, First Eagle Gold was down by about 25%, according to fund researcher Morningstar.
Morningstar gives the New York-based fund its top five-star rating among funds specializing in precious
metals.
"The fact that we were 30% to 35% in bullion helped, to the extent that bullion until a month ago acted much
better than gold-mining stocks," Mr. Eveillard said.
While mining shares went into a free fall, spot gold was down by a more modest 7.4% since the end of 2007.
At the end of November, the First Eagle Gold Fund had assets of $765 million, including all share classes,
Mr. Eveillard said. Since its creation in August 1993 through the end of October, the gold fund has provided a
compounded annual return of 6.5%, while the Financial Times index for gold mines compounded at minus
1.5%, Mr. Eveillard said.
Mr. Eveillard has been portfolio manager for most of the fund's history, retaking the reins after a two-year
retirement in the spring of 2007. The fund was established as insurance against cataclysmic events in the
financial system, he said. "Gold is the only asset that is completely outside of the credit system and the only
asset that has no liability," Mr. Eveillard said.
Thus, the fund didn't dabble in base metals when they ran up more sharply than gold for much of this
decade. "Base metals have nothing to do with gold and nothing to do with the insurance that in my mind gold
represents," he said. And base metals have fallen further than gold this year, with copper losing around 51%
since the end of 2007.
"We are very reluctant to buy stocks of junior gold-mining companies that sit on a deposit that has not been
turned into a mine yet," Mr. Eveillard said. "In the extreme, if a deposit cannot be turned into a mine, then the
price of gold could go to $3,000 an ounce [but] the stock would be worth zero."
Meanwhile, Mr. Eveillard said, First Eagle is one of the few gold funds to hold a large percentage in bullion,
not relying upon exchange-traded funds. As of this past week, 35% of the fund's holdings were in bullion. "If
you look at gold as insurance, then gold bullion is preferable to gold-mining shares," he said, since it avoids
the risks facing mining companies themselves.
When looking at mining stocks, First Eagle focuses on assets still underground and the cost of mining them,
said Rachel Benepe, the fund's analyst.
Mr. Eveillard and Ms. Benepe said they like Royal Gold Inc., a company that relies upon royalties and
thereby avoids mining costs. Stocks of royalty companies tend to be "somewhat expensive," Mr. Eveillard
said, "but we're willing to live with that."

--- Page 165 ---
Page 165 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The fund holds Randgold Resources Ltd., which has mines in French-speaking central Africa. The company
is knowledgeable about the region and its politics, and tends to rely upon organic expansion, or the
development of mines, rather than acquisitions, Mr. Eveillard said.
Randgold is good at every stage -- from finding to building to operating mines, Ms. Benepe said. By contrast,
she said, many mining companies might have only one strength.
Mr. Eveillard said he is "extremely positive" about the longer-term prospects for gold. "What passes for the
monetary system world-wide is fraying at the edges," he said.
President-elect Barack Obama has signaled that his administration will use fiscal policy to stimulate the
economy at the same time the Federal Reserve is doing the same with monetary policy. But ultimately, all of
these plans are likely to prove to be inflationary, Mr. Eveillard said. And investors often buy gold as a hedge
against inflation.

Oil Rises 10%, to $47.98 a Barrel

Oil Rises 10%, to $47.98 a Barrel

NEW YORK -- Crude-oil futures shot up amid expectations of a production cut by OPEC and as the dollar
weakened.
Light, sweet crude for January delivery settled $4.46, or 10%, higher at $47.98 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
Oil has fallen $100 a barrel over the past five months, largely over concerns that weakening economic
conditions would result in a supply glut. Crude futures traded as low as $40.50 a barrel last Friday, a
four-year low.
The gain in crude futures Thursday raised the possibility that $40 marks a bottom for the market, as
production falls in line with lower demand. However, participants were quick to warn that the global economic
downturn, including the highest new jobless claims in the U.S. last week since 1982, leaves open the
possibility of further declines.
Several members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have said that the group will agree to
a large production cut when it meets Wednesday in Oran, Algeria. On Thursday, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,
Ali al-Naimi, said the country cut output to 8.493 million barrels a day in November, close to its quota,
Bloomberg News reported. Mr. Naimi's comments indicate that the kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter,
is supportive of OPEC efforts to reduce supplies.
Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, also could cut production to prevent further declines in oil prices,
President Dmitry Medvedev said, according to a Russian news agency.
The oil market has been skeptical of OPEC's ability to move prices, especially after a cut of 1.5 million barrels
a day in October failed to stop the slide. But sentiment is changing amid indications that Saudi Arabia is
supportive of reducing production.
"People are getting the message that the cuts are in fact going to be severe," said Matt Zeman, head of
trading at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. "Everybody was on the [lower] crude-oil bandwagon so to
speak, and we're seeing some of those people start to abandon those positions."
Supplies outside OPEC also are likely to increase by less than expected next year, as low prices lead to
reduced spending by producers, the International Energy Agency said.
A lobbying group for Canada's oil and gas producers has revised downward its forecast for the nation's
output. The impact to volumes planned for next year is expected to be modest, but output predicted for 2015
could take a greater hit due to announced project delays. Canada's oil sands are seen as a new source of
supply, particularly for the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.
Oil received some support from the dollar, which weakened against the euro Thursday.
A cheaper dollar makes oil priced in the U.S. currency an attractive buy for foreign investors, while also acting
as a hedge against inflation. But the dollar's weakening in response to the poor state of the U.S. economy
mightn't bode well for oil prices, which could fall as demand deteriorates.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices hit a seven-week high as the dollar index fell to a six-week low and crude oil surged. Also, with
Treasury yields falling, some investors are turning to gold amid financial uncertainty. Nearby December gold
gained $17.80, or 2.2%, to $824.90 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex, while most-active
February rose $17.80, or 2.2%, to $826.60.

RICE: Futures surged following the government's supply-and-demand report, which cut U.S. supplies by
almost 8%. The report came amid a "bullish backdrop" that included a weaker dollar and higher crude oil,
said Bill Nelson, analyst for Doane Advisory Services. Chicago Board of Trade January rice gained 47 cents,
or 3.3%, to settle at $14.55 per hundredweight.

Markets in Asia rallied as expectations of interest-rate cuts and economic-stimulus measures forced bearish
investors to reverse bets that the downtrend in stocks will continue.
European shares were confined to a tight trading range Wednesday, as losses from banks and
pharmaceutical stocks offset gains for Rio Tinto and other mineral extractors.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index jumped 5.6% to 15577.74, rising above 15000 after dropping 1.9% on
Tuesday.
"Investors are expecting further rate cuts in the U.S. and that Hong Kong may follow. The market overcame
the resistance at 15000, so the short positions got squeezed," said Andrew To, sales director at Taifook
Securities.
HSBC Holdings climbed 4.4%, and shares of Air China soared 22%, a day after the Chinese civil-aviation
regulator said it was encouraging airlines to cancel or postpone delivery of aircraft.
In SHANGHAI, the composite index finished the day 2% higher at 2079.12. Official data showed
producer-price inflation climbed less than economists expected in November.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose for a third consecutive session, climbing 3.2% to
8660.24, its highest closing level since the middle of November.
Elpida Memory jumped 17%, on top of Tuesday's 18% surge, following a report that the chipmaker could
redeem a recently issued $540 million convertible bond. The bond could have led to a large rise in the
number of outstanding shares, diluting the value of existing stock.
Sony gained 1.1%, recovering from early losses after the company Tuesday announced a restructuring,
which includes cutting 8,000 full-time jobs world-wide. Mizuho Financial Group rose by 5.6%.
In MUMBAI, India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 5.4% to 9654.90 as trading resumed after Tuesday's
holiday. ICICI Bank surged 8.2%.
In SYDNEY, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 1% to 3640.70, reversing early declines. Westpac slumped
8.5% as trading resumed after the bank raised $2.5 billion Australian dollars (US$1.7 billion) by selling stock
to institutional investors.Shares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia dropped 5% after the lender said it will
raise capital by issuing shares to Merrill Lynch International (Australia).
Resource stocks helped offset the weakness in banking shares. BHP Billiton gained 6.7% and Rio Tinto
surged 12%, before Rio Tinto announced plans to cut 14,000 jobs and more than halve its capital spending
for 2009.
Later in the day, European markets were mixed.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index ended virtually unchanged at 205.37. Although the index has
lost roughly 45% in the past 12 months, it managed to take back a small part of those losses at the start of
this week.
"We've had a huge correction in the market. I just wonder whether the markets are saying that we've
discounted an awful lot of the bad news," noted Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.

In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.3% to 4367.28. Mineral extractors advanced, with Rio Tinto leading
the way. Shares jumped 20% after the company announced a measures to conserve cash and lower costs.
Elsewhere in the sector, Xstrata climbed 6.6% and Vedanta Resources advanced 15%.
Among other national markets, the French CAC-40 index ended 0.7% higher at 3320.31 and the German
DAX 30 index rose 0.5% to close at 4804.88.
Later, in TORONTO, shares ended higher, driven by gains in resource stocks. the S&P/TSX Composite Index
rose 2.8% to 8634.00. Barrick Gold increased C$3.40 to C$38.50 while rival gold miner Agnico-Eagle
finished up 6.04 at 46.24. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, a big fertilizer producer, rose 9.53 to 87.60.

Why Tie Health Insurance to a Job?
Why Tie Health Insurance to a Job?

Not many people are buying cars built 60 years ago. No one is watching TV on a set manufactured in the
1940s. Patients are not lining up to see a doctor who hasn't cracked a book since before the polio vaccine
was discovered. Why, then, do millions of Americans get their health care through an employer-based system
from the 1940s?
Employers didn't start offering health benefits roughly 60 years ago because they were experts in medical
decisions. It was a way of circumventing the World War II wage and price controls. Barred from offering
higher salaries to attract workers, employers offered health insurance instead. Aided by an IRS ruling that
said workers who received health benefits did not have to pay income taxes on them, and by the fact that
employers could write off the cost of the health benefits as a business related expense, this accidental
arrangement became the primary way most Americans access health care.
The system worked at first, but a lot has changed in 60 years. Back then, the average soldier returning from
World War II took a job with a local company where he would work for decades until he got a gold watch at a
big retirement party. Today, lifetime employment is dead. By 42, the average American will change jobs 11
times.
Sixty years ago, most American companies competed only against neighboring companies for lucrative
contracts. Today, most businesses are up against foreign companies that don't foot the bill for their
employees' health-care costs.
Today, health-care costs are increasing at twice the rate of inflation. To stay in the black, companies are
forced to raise their employees' premiums and deductibles, opt for cheaper insurance plans, or worse yet,
drop health benefits altogether. Since 2000, the percentage of employers providing health insurance has
declined by nearly 10%.
For too many, the employer-based system is inefficient. Each employer purchases health insurance
separately. According to a recent estimate by the McKinsey Global Institute, this adds more than $75 billion in
underwriting, marketing, sales, billing and other administrative costs that offer no health benefits. More than
half of all American employers who offer health-care benefits don't offer their employees a choice.
Consequently, most Americans don't have the option of giving their business to insurance companies that
treat them well and only cover what they need. This prevents the usual market forces from holding down
costs.
Workers are the ones paying for this waste. The money that employers are spending to buy health care for
their employees could otherwise go to workers in the form of higher wages, empowering individuals to make
their own health-care choices.
The currently available alternative to this employer-based system is even more horrifying. Individuals buying
insurance don't have the same purchasing power as large businesses and end up paying much higher prices
to cover administrative costs and risks. They also don't get the tax breaks that employers get for buying
health insurance. In most states, insurance companies have the right to discriminate against individuals by
denying coverage or charging astronomical prices to anyone with a pre-existing condition. It is no surprise
that, when given the choice between the employer-based system and buying health insurance on their own,
the vast majority of Americans reject the latter. (A Kaiser Health Tracking Poll this summer, for example,
found that only 17% of Americans said they would prefer to buy insurance on their own.)
But this is a false choice. It assumes that the current system is the only option. Why can't Americans have the
best of both worlds?
Americans need some of the benefits of the employer-based system: the security of being part of a large
group, of not being denied coverage because of age and pre-existing conditions, and the convenience of

--- Page 171 ---
Page 171 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
having experts screen qualified plans and manage enrollment. But Americans also need portable insurance --
coverage that follows them when they change jobs, lose jobs, start a business or whatever else may come.
Americans need more choices and the market power to buy the health coverage that works best for them and
their families and, in turn, to make insurance companies compete for their business.
Such a system could be implemented today by creating state or regional insurance exchanges that pool
individuals and small groups to pay the same lower prices charged to larger employers; that certify that all
insurance benefit packages meet minimum consumer protection standards; that manage the enrollment
process; that collect premiums; and that require insurance companies to issue and renew coverage for
anyone who applies, protecting the insurers by paying them a risk-adjusted premium that pays them more
when they enroll sicker, more costly, patients.
Fundamentally, this means that insurance companies would have to change their business model to compete
on the basis of quality, price and benefits, rather than by "cherry picking" the healthiest people to cover. It
means spending less money on administrative costs and more money on keeping patients healthy. And it
means letting everyone keep the health insurance they have if that's what they want, but giving all employers
and employees more choices for their health care.
In the coming year, there will be no shortage of suggestions for fixing the nation's health-care system. But
what Americans and the president-elect need to ask is whether the health-care system that was founded in
the 1940s is the best health-care system for the 21st century. We believe that Americans deserve better.

A $1 Million Chaise? Not This Year --- Demand for limited-edition contemporary furniture flags at Design Miami fair

A $1 Million Chaise? Not This Year --- Demand for limited-edition contemporary furniture flags at
Design Miami fair

Miami Beach, Fla. -- With its extravagant, over-the-top installations and six-digit price tags, the biannual
Design Miami fair gained renown as a celebration of the most extreme end of design: limited-edition
contemporary furniture. Last year, the pricey but often impractical pieces sold out in hours, and New York
retailer Moss set a record by selling two sets of bronze furniture for $1.2 million.
This year, the glow has faded from the fair, which opened Tuesday and runs through Saturday. The number
of participating galleries has shrunk by half a dozen to 23, leading organizers to consider adding dealers of
antique furniture next year. Moss has sold only three pieces of its latest pricey furniture set, which is asking
$495,000. And at Tuesday's VIP preview, the most-crowded stall was that of car maker Audi, which was
serving up free Champagne and shrimp ceviche. It was clear that the emerging category of
modern-furniture-as-art won't be escaping the recession, which is pummeling sales of other discretionary
purchases like fine art, luxury real estate and automobiles.
Surrounded by the brightly-painted lacquered furniture of American designer Roy McMakin, New York dealer
Matthew Marks said he decided to keep prices for Mr. McMakin's "Simple Chair" at $5,000 apiece,
unchanged since 2005. "I'm not embarrassed to lower my prices," adds Mr. Marks, who represents Lucian
Freud, Brice Marden and other major artists and is exhibiting both here and at Art Basel Miami, the massive
sister fair for fine art also taking place this week.
"Everyone lowered prices before they came here," says Kenny Schachter, of Rove Projects in London. He
sold several Zaha Hadid pieces, one for $100,000. "And I'm sure if you make an offer for anything, nothing is
at face value."
Versions of the popular "stuffed toy" stools by Brazil's Campana Brothers, known for incorporating ordinary
and indigenous materials into their designs, were for sale for $22,000. The Campana's earlier edition of
stuffed animal banquettes (featuring alligators, sharks, dolphins and several other animals) had retailed
recently for $50,000, said Matt Langton, director of London-based Albion, which is selling the items.
Founded in 2005, Design Miami quickly became a crucial marketplace for "design art," furniture marketed in
limited editions and pitched as collectibles. Buoyed by the booming art market and the fetish for housing and
real estate, impractical but innovative designs were suddenly selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The craze quickly spread: In October 2007, Marc Newson's curvy but uncomfortable riveted chaise lounge
sold for roughly $1.5 million at Christie's -- a barometer of the market's peak.
Some dealers say that the go-go price inflation of the past few years hurt the category because it attracted
speculators who snapped up a piece only to resell at a profit. The frequent trading dumped too much work on
the auction block, says Mr. Schachter, the London dealer. By last summer, sales were falling flat. Sotheby's
failed to sell 40% of its lots at its summer design auction.
Now this once hot category is suddenly facing a less certain future. Dealers are cutting back on fairs, laying
off workers, shopping for smaller warehouse spaces, and of course, offering discounts.
Some dealers are pitching value. Priveekollektie Contemporary Art/Design, a three-year-old gallery based in
the Netherlands, drew attention with young Dutch designer Pieke Bergmans's "Light Blub Chandelier," a
massive lamp made up of 40 hand-blown bulbs lit by LED lights. Selling for $175,000, it is a relative bargain
when compared against the $850,000 ceiling-to-floor crystal chandelier designed by Ross Lovegrove for
Swarovski.

Gloom aside, the fair and its satellite shows offered a well-chosen, if quixotic, collection of contemporary
design. East-meets-West themed furnishings from the new Al Sabah Art &Design Collection commissioned
by Sheik Majed, of Kuwait's Villa Moda, had mainly sold out, including 1960s-style Beirut furniture recovered
in lush indigenous Central Asian fabrics and mother-of-pearl antique furniture with handblown glass vases
partially melted on top (from $8,000 to roughly $60,000).
Also attracting attention was a $45,000 wood console made from three-dimensional fractals by architects
Aranda/Lasch, a group whose work was featured in part of a Museum of Modern Art show earlier this year
and who also designed the fair's exhibition tent. The piece sold. Last year a larger table in the same style sold
for $85,000.
Across the street from the main tent was a curated exhibition: "Beyond Organic: Design in the State of
Nature," featuring landscaped tropical plant vignettes interspersed with nature-inspired designs including a
vintage Arne Jacobsen's Egg Chair (1958) and a glass and metal cabinet with logs inside by Arik Levy
(2008). One of the pieces in that show, "Do You Hear What I Hear?," boasted a taxidermy fox with gold
maggots in its ears by London-based Kelly McCallum. Priced at $20,000, it was more sculpture than furniture
and was one of the earliest pieces to sell, according to dealer Zesty Meyers, of R 20th Century.

Gold prices fell on the liquidation of positions by funds and expectations of more before the end of the year.
Worries about the recession and strength of the U.S. dollar also took a toll, analysts said.
The price of the nearby December gold contract fell $12.50, or 1.6%, to settle at $768.80 an ounce on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the price of the most-active February contract
fell $12.80, or 1.6%, to $770.50.
"It seems like the hedge funds are preparing for year-end liquidation," said George Gero, vice president at
RBC Capital Markets Global Futures. "And the problem isn't just that they are preparing for liquidation, but
there is nobody there with a bushel basket of money to take the other side of the selling."
This tends to exacerbate downward moves, he said.
The market opened weaker, and several traders linked some of this to the U.S. dollar's strength, especially
amid expectations for interest-rate cuts Thursday in Europe.
Analysts also tied gold's soft tone to the U.S. recession, particularly after a weak private-sector jobs report
from Automatic Data Processing and Macroeconomic Advisors, along with a soft Institute for Supply
Management nonmanufacturing index. "In gold right now, people are raising capital and selling," said John
Person, president of NationalFutures.com "There is no reason to hold gold as a hedge against inflation right
now."
Observers cited the recent rise in prices on long-term Treasurys, and corresponding decline in yields, as a
sign of reduced inflationary concerns. Many investors also are favoring bonds as a safe haven, they added.
Several analysts suggested gold should draw support eventually as an inflation hedge, particularly since
efforts by central bankers and governments to reignite their economies are likely to mean rising price
pressures.
"Eventually, all of this liquidity is going to cause an inflationary spiral that is going to be very bullish for gold,"
said Bill O'Neill, a principal at Logic Advisors. "But we're not there yet. It's much too soon to even think
about."
Several analysts said gold may either move sideways for the remainder of 2008 or else slip back to
somewhere between $680 and $720.
"I think we're in a deflationary cycle right now," said Charles Nedoss, metals analyst with Peak Trading
Group. Thus, "gold is having a hard time getting up and going. That is likely to continue for the rest of the
year."
In other commodity markets:
COPPER: Prices fell early on economic data, but pared those declines as U.S. equities rebounded. The thinly
traded nearby December contract declined 4.5 cents, or more than 2.8%, to settle at $1.5335 a pound on the
Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most-active March fell 4.6 cents to $1.5545.

More Americans are looking for a way to add luster to their individual retirement accounts -- gold. They are
taking advantage of little-known U.S. tax regulations to buy precious metals, coins and bars for their IRAs.
Some rules and fees exist that don't apply to other kinds of IRA investments. The metals must be stored in a
depository, for instance, and there are storage fees.
Still, some investors consider precious metals worthwhile for a small portion of their IRA portfolio, for many of
the same reasons they buy precious metals in general: They diversify the portfolio, they're a hedge against
inflation, and an insurance policy against disasters like this fall's stock-market meltdown.
Similarly, financial planners interviewed for this article included skeptics who oppose putting metals in IRAs,
though not for reasons having to do with IRAs themselves. These critics tend not to recommend direct
ownership of precious metals in general, citing limited liquidity and the lack of interest or dividend payments.
These critics favor using other hedges in IRAs, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or proxies for
precious metals, such as mining stocks.
Gold's history as an investment is spotty. After a record high of $850 an ounce in 1980, gold was lower for
nearly three decades before finally hitting a new peak in January. During that time, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average soared from below 1,000 to above 10,000. But since 2001, gold has far outperformed equities, with
the spot price roughly quadrupling to a record of $1,032.50 in March before pulling back.
To buy precious metals in a retirement account, investors need a self-directed IRA, which is a type of
retirement account that can invest in almost any kind of asset except life insurance and collectibles.
Companies that offer self-directed IRAs and metal-investing services include Sterling Trust Co., GoldStar
Trust Co. and The Entrust Group.
"It's a fairly small segment of our business, roughly 10% in terms of number of accounts and assets held,"
says Kelli Click, vice president for marketing and product development at Sterling Trust, in Waco, Texas. "But
it is a growing trend and definitely one we've noticed in the last couple of years," she says. As of early in the
fourth quarter, the firm administered some 62,000 IRAs with assets of more than $4 billion. Ms. Click put the
value of metals in those IRAs at $380 million to $400 million. The number of IRAs at Sterling Trust that hold
metals, meanwhile, is up 150% so far in 2008, she says.
GoldStar Trust had 7,200 retirement accounts holding precious metals totaling a little more than $400 million
early in the fourth quarter, says Trey Hightower, trust officer for GoldStar in Canyon, Texas. Metals IRA
transactions surged some 700% over the prior 16 months, he adds.
The Entrust Group reports that of its 50,000 clients with approximately $4 billion in self-directed IRAs early in
the fourth quarter, close to 1% of the accounts held metals, with value estimated at $11 million. Some $10
million worth of those metals holdings came since Jan. 1, and 4% of all new assets purchased by clients this
year were metals, the company says.
George Cooper, senior account executive with the bullion dealer USA GOLD-Centennial Precious Metals in
Denver, says that he fields 30 to 50 phone calls a day about coins or precious metals, and that half of the
inquiries are for IRA investments. "In the springtime, we had a lot of interest in gold because of the price," Mr.
Cooper says.
GoldStar's Mr. Hightower, meanwhile, says his company kept getting calls this autumn even as gold prices
retreated. The callers were looking for a safe haven as the credit crisis intensified, he says. "We do have
folks coming in thinking, 'I'm going to make money,'" Mr. Hightower says. "But we have a lot who have
expressed that they want to preserve what they do have."

Investors often buy gold not as an investment but as a "currency of last resort," says Hugh Bromma, chief
executive of The Entrust Group in Reno, Nev. "Gold has not historically outperformed the stock market," he
says. "So the person using their IRA is looking for a safe haven for cash."
Nevertheless, he describes the investment as "only suited to people who know how precious metals, such as
gold, work." They should be aware of risks of commodities generally and the potential for volatility, he says.
David Morgan, an independent precious-metals analyst and founder of Silver-Investor.com, in Spokane,
Wash., says many Americans "don't have a clue" that they can include metals in their IRAs. He advocates
metals because of their negative correlation to other assets, particularly equities. Gold tends to perform best
when "needed most," when more traditional asset classes decline, he says.
Mostly older investors are buying gold for their self-directed IRAs, after opening new accounts or performing
rollovers or transfers from their previous IRA custodian. Investors should check out potential custodians
before making a move, says IRA consultant Ed Slott of Ed Slott &Co., Rockville Centre, N.Y. Also take care
to transfer the IRA correctly -- preferably from trustee to trustee -- to avoid creating a "taxable event," Mr.
Slott says.
Once the account is open, investors select a bullion dealer from which to purchase metal. The dealer sends
purchased metal to a depository, which notifies the account custodian when the metal arrives.
Commissions and fees are one of the considerations when choosing a custodian or a dealer, but industry
officials also cite service, such as how quickly a dealer can deliver metal. Annual fees charged by IRA
custodians range from $50 to $250 for administration; storage charges are mostly around $90 to $100. There
also are bullion-dealer commissions.
How favorably a fee-based financial planner or adviser looks on gold as part of an IRA hinges partly on
whether they like gold as an investment for any kind of portfolio.
"I wouldn't tie up too much of the IRA in that, but it's not bad for a piece, just to hedge your bets," says Mr.
Slott, who adds that he advises investors to maintain sufficient liquid assets in case of an emergency.
(Custodians of IRA accounts say it can take from a few days to a couple of weeks to get a check. )
"I'm not a fan," says Sheryl Garrett, founder of the Garrett Planning Network, in Shawnee Mission, Kan. Ms.
Garrett prefers TIPS to protect against inflation. "You'd actually get a positive return," she says. "No matter
what, there is some interest paid. And it's secure -- as secure as anything can be."
Ms. Garrett says other commodities, like oil or natural gas, are better than gold as an inflation hedge. The
price of gold, she says, is too dependent on jewelry demand.
Mary Erl, founder of Nestegg Financial Advisors in Gurnee, Ill., says gold "generally does work" as an
inflation hedge, but she also favors TIPS. Gold offers a psychological advantage in that investors can hold it
in their hands, she says. But there are other ways to own precious metals in IRAs, she says, such as mining
stocks, which earn dividends and avoid storage costs.
The metals analyst Mr. Morgan and Jim Puplava, a money manager and chief executive of San Diego-based
PFS Group, argue for holding physical metal and not relying solely on mining stocks. While prices trend
together, there is some divergence.
Mr. Puplava points out that while gold was down 10% for the year, the American Stock Exchange's Gold
BUGS Index was down more than 50%.
"When the price of the metal goes up, the mining stocks can go up two or three times faster," he says. This is
because higher gold prices mean rising profits for mining companies. Plus, the value of their underground
reserves increases. "Conversely," he adds, "when the price of metals goes down, you can see the price of
stocks go down even further."

Blame the 1920s Fed, Not Gold Standard

In his Nov. 26 Letter "The Gold Standard Doesn't Glitter," Simon James Bogli, responding to Gerald P.
O'Driscoll Jr.'s "To Prevent Bubbles, Restrain the Fed" (op-ed, Nov. 17), writes that the U.S. gold standard
exacerbated deflationary forces. In fact, as Amity Shlaes writes in her book "Forgotten Man," gold seeking a
haven flowed into the U.S. during this period, but the Federal Reserve sterilized this new money by selling
bonds, thus preventing the gold standard from functioning properly. Mr. Bogli is correct that the Fed hindered
recovery -- a cautionary tale for our times -- but he is wrong to cite the gold standard as the cause.
Mr. Bogli blames the Fed for "not being able to control equity prices of the 1920s." But it is not the job of the
Fed to "control" equity prices. Moreover, one can argue that much of the run-up in prices during the '20s was
well-justified. As Russell Napier writes in "Anatomy of the Bear," "On 24 August 1921, the DJIA closed at
63.9, a level first reached on 27 January 1899. Essentially, the industrials index had gone nowhere in two
decades." Thus the '20s was a catch-up period that took the market from undervalued to overvalued during a
period of extraordinary innovation (electricity, telephone and autos) and productivity gains.
The excessive use of leverage during both the 1920s and recent times is a far more deserving villain.

Pilgrim's In Discussions With Lenders

Pilgrim's Pride Corp. said it expects to report a fiscal-fourth-quarter loss of $802 million, or $10.83 a share, as
speculation grew on Wall Street that the ailing chicken giant is close to deciding whether it will seek
bankruptcy protection.
The Pittsburg, Texas, firm said late Friday that discussions with its lenders about continuing to temporarily
waive debt covenants is delaying the filing of its annual 10-K report for the fiscal year ended Sept. 27 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a part of its notification to the SEC, Pilgrim's Pride disclosed that
its fourth-quarter results will include a noncash charge of $501.4 million, or $6.77 a share, in connection with
Gold Kist Inc., which it bought for $1.1 billion in 2006.
While the acquisition made Pilgrim's the largest U.S. chicken processor and gave it control of 26% of the
nation's bird-slaughter capacity, it also loaded its books with debt just as the cost of raising chickens was
beginning to soar. The U.S. chicken industry was battered in 2007 and much of 2008 by rapidly rising prices
of corn and soybeans, which is fed in copious amounts to chickens.
Although crop prices have fallen since July, the chicken industry is still struggling to raise its prices enough to
recoup its added expenses.
During the 2007 fiscal fourth quarter, Pilgrim's Pride generated net income of $33.2 million, or 50 cents a
share, on sales of $2.1 billion. For the 2008 fiscal year, Pilgrim's Pride said it expects to report a net loss of
$998.6 million, or $14.40 a share, on sales of $8.5 billion.
Robert Moskow, a Credit Suisse equity analyst, said in a report issued Friday that he expects Pilgrim's Pride
management to announce Monday whether it will seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy
laws. According to Mr. Moskow, the latest in a series of waivers by Pilgrim's lenders is set to expire Monday.
A company spokesman couldn't be reached to comment Friday.

Regarding Gerald P. O'Driscoll Jr.'s "To Prevent Bubbles, Restrain the Fed" (op-ed, Nov. 17):
I find it curious that Mr. O'Driscoll somehow believes that a gold standard can actually deflate asset prices.
Does he not remember the Great Depression? At the time, the U.S. was the vanguard of the reconstructed
gold standard, yet the Federal Reserve was unable to control the manic equity prices of the 1920s. What's
worse, the U.S. gold standard exacerbated deflationary forces and hindered American recovery from the
Depression.
I think the issue of deflating asset bubbles deserves a far more sophisticated policy response than just
shackling the money supply to gold or any other commodity.
Providing the Fed with the discretion to run monetary policy has not been without its failures; however, I
can't imagine how Mr. O'Driscoll would contemplate addressing the persistent deflation that we would be
suffering under his policy, given that most commodity prices in the past 100 years have fallen very
significantly in real terms.
There's no point popping an asset bubble on Wall Street if Main Street is laboring under a Japanese-style
deflation. It's cracking the nut with a sledgehammer, in monetary terms.

President-elect Barack Obama and future presidents might be well advised to appoint Fed members more
willing to follow William Machesney Martin's dictum:
"The Fed's job is to take away the punch bowl just before the party starts."
I do not know how closely Chairman Martin's Fed followed his advice, but if they did and it worked, this
simple, common sense approach should itself prevent, or at least dampen, future bubbles.

World News: Russia Allows the Ruble to Weaken Again
World News: Russia Allows the Ruble to Weaken Again

MOSCOW -- Russia's central bank allowed the ruble to shed 1% of its value Monday for the second time this
month, strengthening expectations that it will conduct a staged weakening of the currency, rather than a
one-off devaluation, at least for now.
The market had expected the move, which the bank executed by widening the ruble's trading band against a
dollar/euro basket by 30 kopecks in each direction.
Only a few months ago, the Kremlin promoted the ruble as a symbol of Russia's might and economic
independence. But it has shed 6% since August against a basket composed 55% of dollars and 45% of
euros. It fell 2% against the euro Monday but rose 1% against the dollar.
As oil prices have crumbled amid massive capital outflows, many economists have argued that the ruble is
overvalued and that an abrupt, one-step adjustment is needed to keep the country's massive gold and
foreign reserves from disappearing as the government continues to tap them to defend the currency.
Because of the strain on the ruble from oil prices falling nearly two-thirds since their July peak above $145, as
well as capital outflows of $83 billion in the months of August to October, some economists have forecast that
its value will be halved within a year.
But many market observers see it falling only 20%. The central bank, which has been consistently vague in
disclosing monetary and foreign-exchange policy plans, declined to comment beyond calling the move a
"technical decision."
However, Russia's monetary and government officials have said often that there will be no sharp fluctuations
in the exchange rate. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin vowed last week that the country won't see economic
shocks like those of 1991 and 1998, pledging the continued use of its foreign reserves to defend the
currency.
"The famous ruble-appreciation story is turning into a depreciation story," said Alexander Morozov, chief
economist at HSBC in Moscow, in a note to clients. "This has happened surprisingly fast."
Both Mr. Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev have said they keep their personal assets in rubles. But that
hasn't persuaded people not to rush to convert their rubles into dollars. Analysts estimate extra dollar sales at
exchange points in November at $1 billion a week.
Russia's gold and foreign-currency reserves -- still the world's third-largest at $453.5 billion in mid-November
-- have shed $144 billion since peaking in August.

Oil Moves Back Above $50 --- Bailout Allays Investors, Who Return to Commodities

NEW YORK -- Crude-oil prices shot up as commodities markets benefited from a surge in investor
confidence.
Markets rallied early on news of the proposed U.S. government rescue of Citigroup Inc., interpreting the move
as easing the uncertainty that had plagued the financial sector in recent days.
Though such concerns didn't disappear Monday, investors who had stashed funds in the dollar as a
safe-haven investment appeared to be moving back into commodities and equities. The euro reached a
two-week high against the dollar, while most commodities prices rose.
The price of the contract for light, sweet crude for January delivery rose $4.57, or 9.2%, to settle at $54.50 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Analysts and traders differed as to whether the move marked the start of a new chapter for an oil market that
has traded consistently lower the past four months and fell 12% last week over fears the economic downturn
was deepening.
"It's too early to say yet, but this certainly looks positive," said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures in
Newport Beach, Calif. "This has to become a habit. If [Tuesday] is another day like today, that may change
the mood of these markets substantially."
Others were quick to dismiss any increases made in the days before the Thanksgiving holiday, when activity
often is light and volatile. "Whatever happens this week will be a lot of . . . getting money out before the
holiday," said Stephen Schork, editor of the Schork Report, an energy newsletter in Villanova, Pa. "I can't tell
you which way, but what we can expect is a lot of volatility."
The oil market's focus this week is likely to turn to two coming meetings of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the first of which will be Saturday in Cairo. OPEC President Chakib Khelil said there
likely wouldn't be a production cut announced at the Nov. 29 meeting, but a reduction is widely expected at
the second gathering on Dec. 17 in Oran, Algeria.
Both the size and timing of a cut from the cartel are still up in the air, though Mr. Khelil and analysts agree it
must total more than 1 million barrels a day to come close to matching demand lost to the weak economy.
In other commodity markets:
COPPER: A sharply weaker U.S. dollar and higher equities that accompanied improved market sentiment
after the Citigroup bailout sparked short covering in copper futures, boosting the metal after the release of
supportive Chinese trade figures. The price of the thinly traded Comex November contract rose 9.5 cents, or
more than 6%, to settle at $1.6660 a pound, while the most-active March contract rose 9.25 cents to $1.6715.
SILVER: Prices rose in tandem with gold, though the gray metal outperformed gold in percentage terms
because "silver was a little more oversold than gold," said Michael Gross, broker and futures analyst with
OptionSellers.com. The thinly traded nearby November silver contract rose 87.5 cents, or 9.2%, to settle at
$10.355 an ounce, while most-active March rose 87.3 cents to $10.378.

Gold Market's Recent Price Gains
Suggest Oil May Be Losing Its Grip
---
Retail Customers Flock to Metal Amid Crude's Fall
The harsh, uncompromising selling engulfed most assets last week, including stocks, commercial
mortgage-backed securities, oil, and grains. But somebody forgot to tell the gold market.
Gold traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange for November delivery closed up $43.10 to $791.80 an
ounce Friday, its highest settlement in more than a month. For the week, gold gained 6.7%, and investors
are considering the possibility that the tight movements between gold and oil may have broken.
It could signal that these two commodities might be reverting to their old relationship, where they generally
move independent of one another. "I'd almost given up on gold, because amid all these crises, gold couldn't
even rally to a new high," says Sean Peche, manager at BlueAlpha Investment Advisory Ltd. "Now, all of a
sudden it's decoupled from oil. Oil has collapsed in a heap and now we're seeing a big move in gold."
In the early part of 2008, oil and gold were the beneficiaries of massive funds available to asset managers,
who jumped from one asset class to another over a period of several months. Stocks peaked in October
2007, gold hit its peak in March 2008, and oil peaked in July 2008.
Beginning Wednesday, though, gold and oil walked different paths. The price of crude fell below $50, while
gold rebounded, in part on news of increased demand from retail investors. "For oil at this juncture, it's this
specter of extremely sluggish demand," says Jon Nadler, senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers. "With gold,
there's a bit of a safe-haven component."
Still, it is a weird environment for gold. The yellow metal was a favorite inflation hedge of many, and
consumer prices fell last month. Gold is often a beneficiary of a weak dollar, and the dollar is strengthening.
Perhaps some of this "Great Depression II" talk that has erupted of late is sparking interest in gold as a
storehouse of value. But Mr. Nadler says he wants to see this trend continue a bit longer, noting that other
precious metals, such as silver and platinum, haven't been as buoyant as gold. "I'm not sure there's a full
decoupling at play here yet," he says.

The Fed Is Out of Ammunition
The Fed Is Out of Ammunition

With an estimated $4 trillion in housing wealth and $9 trillion in stock-market wealth destroyed so far in the
United States, there is little doubt that we are witnessing a classic debt-deflation bust at work, characterized
by falling prices, frozen credit markets and plummeting asset values.
Those who want to understand the mechanism might ponder Irving Fisher's comment in 1933: When it comes
to booms gone bust, "over-investment and over-speculation are often important; but they would have far less
serious results were they not conducted with borrowed money."
The growing risk of falling prices raises a challenge for one of the conventional wisdoms of the modern
economics profession, and indeed modern central banking: the belief that it is impossible to have deflation in
a fiat paper-money system. Yet U.S. core CPI fell by 0.1% month-on-month in October, the first such decline
since December 1982.
The origins of the modern conventional wisdom lies in the simplistic monetarist interpretation of the Great
Depression popularized by Milton Friedman and taught to generations of economics students ever since. This
argued that the Great Depression could have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had been more proactive
about printing money. Yet the Japanese experience of the 1990s -- persistent deflationary malaise
unresponsive to near zero-percent interest rates -- shows that it is not so easy to inflate one's way out of a
debt bust.
In the U.S., the Fed can only control the supply of money; it cannot control the velocity of money or the rate at
which it turns over. The dramatic collapse in securitization over the past 18 months reflects the continuing
collapse in velocity as financial engineering goes into reverse.
True, this will change one day. But for now, the issuance of nonagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in
America has plunged by 98% year-on-year to a monthly average of $0.82 billion in the past four months,
down from a peak of $136 billion in June 2006. There has been no new issuance in commercial MBS since
July. This collapse in securitization is intensely deflationary.
It is also true that under Chairman Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve balance sheet continues to expand at
a frantic rate, as do commercial-bank total reserves in an effort to counter credit contraction. Thus, the
Federal Reserve banks' total assets have increased by $1.28 trillion since early September to $2.19 trillion on
Nov. 19. Likewise, the aggregate reserves of U.S. depository institutions have surged nearly 14-fold in the
past two months to $653 billion in the week ended Nov. 19 from $47 billion at the beginning of September.
But the growth of excess reserves also reflects bank disinterest in lending the money. This suggests the
banks only want to finance existing positions, such as where they have already made credit-line
commitments.
Monetarist Bernanke and others blame Japan's postbubble deflationary downturn on policy errors by the
Bank of Japan. But he and others are about to find out that monetary gymnastics are not as effective as they
would like to think. So too will the Keynesians who view an aggressive fiscal policy as the best way to counter
a deflationary slump. While public-works spending can blunt the downside and provide jobs, it remains the
case that FDR's New Deal did not end the Great Depression.
There are no easy policy answers to the current credit convulsion and intensifying financial panic -- not as
long as politicians and central bankers are determined not to let financial institutions fail, and so prevent the
market from correcting the excesses. This is why this writer has a certain sympathy for Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson, even if nobody else seems to. The securitized nature of this credit cycle, combined with the
nightmare levels of leverage embedded in the products dreamt up by the quantitative geeks, means this is a
horribly difficult issue to solve.

--- Page 186 ---
Page 186 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Virtually everybody blames Mr. Paulson for the decision to let Lehman Brothers go. But this decision should
be applauded for precipitating the deflationary unwind that was going to come sooner or later anyway.
The Japanese precedent also remains important because the efforts in the West to prevent the market from
disciplining excesses will have, as in Japan, unintended, adverse, long-term consequences. In Japan, one
legacy is the continuing existence of a large number of uncompetitive companies which have caused profit
margins to fall for their more productive competitors. Another consequence has been a long-term deflationary
malaise, which has kept yen interest rates ridiculously low to the detriment of savers.
Meanwhile, the most recent Fed survey of loan officers provides hard evidence of the intensifying credit
crunch in America. A net 83.6% of domestic banks reported having tightened lending standards on
commercial and industrial loans to large and midsize firms over the past three months, the highest since the
data series began in 1990. A net 47% of banks also indicated that they had become less willing to make
consumer installment loans over the past three months.
Consumers are also more reluctant to borrow. A net 48% of respondents indicated that they had experienced
weaker demand for consumer loans of all types over the past quarter, up from 30% in the July survey. This
hints at the Japanese outcome of "pushing on a string" -- i.e., the banks can make credit available but cannot
force people to borrow.
What happens next? With a fed-funds rate at 0.5% or lower in coming months, it is fast becoming time for
investors to read again Mr. Bernanke's speeches in 2002 and 2003 on the subject of combating falling
inflation. In these speeches, the Fed chairman outlined how policy could evolve once short-term interest
rates get to near zero. A key focus in such an environment will be to bring down long-term interest rates,
which help determine the rates of mortgages and other debt instruments. This would likely involve in practice
the Fed buying longer-term Treasury bonds.
It would seem fair to conclude that a Bernanke-led Fed will follow through on such policies in coming months
if, as is likely, the U.S. economy continues to suffer and if inflationary pressures continue to collapse. Such
actions will not solve the problem but will merely compound it, by adding debt to debt.
In this respect the present crisis in the West will ultimately end up discrediting mechanical monetarism -- and
with it the fiat paper-money system in general -- as the U.S. paper-dollar standard, in place since Richard
Nixon broke the link with gold in 1971, finally disintegrates.
The catalyst will be foreign creditors fleeing the dollar for gold. That will in turn lead to global recognition of
the need for a vastly more disciplined global financial system and one where gold, the "barbarous relic"
scorned by most modern central bankers, may well play a part.

Large Stock Focus: Citigroup's November Swoon: Down 72%
Large Stock Focus: Citigroup's November Swoon: Down 72%

Despite Wall Street's late rally Friday, Citigroup fell 94 cents, or 20%, to $3.77 on the day, taking its losses to
60% for the week and 72% for November.
Selling of Citi's shares grew heavier after Chief Executive Vikram Pandit said he had no desire to sell the
Smith Barney brokerage unit. The stock's close was the lowest for Citi since the last day of 1992; it has lost
more than $53.8 billion in market value in November.
"It's mind-boggling," said Bud Haslett, chief executive of Miller Tabak Capital Management.
Traders say the Treasury Department's decision last week against buying distressed assets abruptly changed
the outlook for banks.
Reflecting the panicky nature of the markets, one of the nation's largest manufacturers is now trading under
the $2 billion threshold used by The Wall Street Journal to define a small-cap stock.
General Motors rose 18 cents, or 6.3%, to 3.06, and finished the week up 1.7%. The visit by the heads of the
three Detroit auto makers to Capitol Hill was inconclusive, as Democrats in Congress offered only a glimmer
of hope, saying they would reconsider a rescue if GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler LLC submit convincing
turnaround plans by Dec. 2.
Ford Motor tacked on 4 cents to 1.43, and lost 21% on the week.
In what's shaping up to be the most volatile stock market in terms of percentage swings since the 1930s,
traders say it takes little to push the market in one direction or another.
"We're trying to find logic in what is a very illogical market," said Peter McCorry, senior equity trader at Keefe,
Bruyette &Woods. Traders are acting on "pure emotion," he said.
Goldman Sachs Group rose 1.31, or 2.5%, to 53.31, finishing the week with a loss of 20%. Morgan Stanley
rose 85 cents, or 9.2%, to 10.05, but down 16% on the week. The model of Wall Street banks is under strain
as investments across all asset classes turn sour.
KeyCorp fell 64 cents, or 9.3%, to 6.27 after the regional bank slashed its dividend.
Dell (Nasdaq) shed 51 cents, or 5.2%, to 9.30. Third-quarter profit exceeded the Wall Street estimate, helped
by cost cuts, but revenue fell to $15.16 billion from $15.65 billion a year earlier.
The shopping season begins in force next week, and traders will see if consumer-spending fears are justified.
The Consumer Select Discretionary SPDR, a basket of retailers and other consumer stocks, rose 1.12, or
6.9%, to 17.45 Friday, and fell 9% on the week, just one of many wild swings.
Gold-mining companies surged Friday as a wave of "deflation" fears receded for now. Gold is used as a safe
haven, but also a hedge against inflation, a market worry that was replaced by deflation lately. Newmont
Mining added 5.79, or 25%, to 28.79, but has fallen by almost half since its peak.

Dutch to Merge
Fortis, ABN Units
The Dutch government said it will merge the retail-banking operations of Fortis NV and ABN Amro and
named former Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm as chief executive of the combined bank. "ABN Amro and Fortis
have to go forward as one powerful Dutch company," said Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende. The
state decided to buy Fortis's Dutch businesses, which include Dutch bank ABN Amro that Fortis took over a
year ago, for 16.8 billion euros ($20.96 billion) in early October after it lost the confidence of investors and
depositors. Fortis had taken over ABN Amro with Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and Banco Santander
SA for 70 billion euros last year.
Australia's Investec
To Lay Off 15%
Investec Bank (Australia) Ltd., a wholly owned unit of Investec Group, plans to lay off about 15% of its
Australian work force, a spokesman confirmed Friday. The layoffs will raise fears the global banking crisis is
beginning to bear down on Australia, whose banks have remained relatively unscathed. The approximately
60 jobs are full-time positions across the bank. Investec employs 400 staff across Australia. The investment
bank also is merging its Perth operations into its Sydney headquarters, excluding its professional finance
business, Experien.
Sweden Begins Sale
Of Carnegie Assets
The board of Carnegie AB said it was questioning the legality of the Swedish government's decision to take
over the Swedish investment bank after Sweden's National Debt Office said earlier Friday it had started the
sales process. Carnegie put up shares in units Carnegie Investment Bank AB and insurance branch Max
Matthiessen AB as collateral for a five billion Swedish kronor ($601 million) loan from the Swedish central
bank. The National Debt Office said no time frame has been set for completion of the transaction. It plans to
sell the shares in Carnegie Investment Bank and Max Matthiessen as separate units.
AngloGold Loan
Buys Some Time
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. on Friday said it secured a $1 billion bridge loan that buys it time to refinance until
credit markets have recovered, meaning it won't be forced into a fire sale of assets. The big South African
gold miner continues to discuss the sale of nonstrategic assets, but Chief Executive Mark Cutifani said this
can take time. "We're not sellers if it's not for value," he said. The loan with Standard Chartered Bank will be
used to repay a convertible bond due Feb. 27. Mr. Cutifani said., "This was the last brick in the wall to make
us bulletproof."

Gold Prices Rally in a Move to Safety --- Metal Briefly Pierces $800 on Jitters Over Wider Market Concerns

Gold Prices Rally in a Move to Safety --- Metal Briefly Pierces $800 on Jitters Over Wider Market
Concerns

Gold prices rallied as safe-haven buying amid broader global market worries sent the metal briefly past $800
an ounce.
The move higher gained support from participants buying back positions to cover "short" bets that prices
would fall. Traders and investors also added fresh long positions that anticipate further price increases in the
wake of Thursday's expiration of December gold options.
Support after option expiration "left shorts scrambling to cover, adding to a jump in investment demand," said
George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
The price of the thinly traded nearby November gold contract rose $43.10, or more than 5.8%, to settle at
$791.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price of the most-active December contract also rose $43.10, settling at $791.80 an ounce. In pit-trading
hours, the contract hit as high as $801.90, then moved as high as $802.80 in afterhours electronic trading.
Although the safe-haven buying picked up from the muted levels of late, the rally may prove fragile as there
is the potential for profit-taking going into the Thanksgiving holiday.
Prices may "crumble" next week if some measure of calm returns to financial markets, said Sterling Smith,
vice president with FuturesOne.
"My gut feeling is it's probably going to fade," said Michael Gross, broker and futures analyst with
OptionSellers.com.
Much of Friday's rally in gold came as participants fled to the metal amid "wider financial infrastructure
concerns," Mr. Smith said.
Gold benefited as participants looked for a store of value while they fear a "general economic meltdown" and
worry about Citigroup Inc., said Zachary Oxman, senior trader with Wisdom Financial. "I think people are
looking for a place to hoard money," Mr. Oxman said.
Executives at Citigroup, faced with a plunging stock price, began weighing the possibility of auctioning off
pieces of the financial giant.
Gold also gained momentum when rising prices triggered preplaced buy orders.
An options contract conveys the right -- while futures contracts are obligations -- to buy or sell a commodity or
equity at a certain price in the future.
In other commodity markets:
COTTON: Prices rose 4.7%, as the aggressive selling that plagued the market earlier in the week dissipated.
Cotton also rose on news that most of the deliveries made against the December contract on the first day of
the delivery cycle were accepted by an end-user, a bullish sign. The price of the December contract rose 1.35
cents to settle at 40.99 cents a pound.

[As Thanksgiving nears, Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim picks her favorite rare books on early America]
1. Mourt's Relation
By William Bradford and Edward Winslow
1622
For narrative suspense and visual detail, few accounts of the Plymouth colony's first year can match this
report by the Mayflower passengers William Bradford and Edward Winslow. ("Mourt's Relation" refers to the
Bradford family connection who published the work.) We see them wading ashore in the fall of 1620, wary of
the unseen natives but obliged to seek them out to barter for food. For days they find only clues: a distant
plume of smoke, the shallow grave of a child, abandoned huts, the head of a freshly killed deer. Finally, one
evening: the cry "Indians! Indians!" and a hail of arrows. A year later, with the group of 102 nearly halved by
frost and disease, the Pilgrims sit down to an autumn feast. The Indians, now friendly, join them.
2. A Description of New-England
By John Smith
1616
In 1614, John Smith turned his back on the squabbling Virginia colony -- and on Pocahontas -- to explore the
unmapped north. In this book, published two years later, he gives the region a name designed to lure
readers: "New-England." But more than a sales pitch, Smith's work is a plea for a new colonial work ethic.
The riches of North America, Smith says, lie in timber and fish and agricultural crops, which require hard work
and long-term settlement. Of the Spanish get-rich-quick dreams of gold and plunder he writes: "More are
choked than well fed with such hasty hopes." Great civilizations, he says, "have no advantage in nature but
this: They are beautified by the long labor and diligence of industrious people and art."
3. An Almanack for the Year of Our Lord 1647
By Samuel Danforth
1647
The almanac, wrote 19th-century literary historian Moses Coit Tyler, is "the very quack, clown, pack-horse
and pariah of American literature." One such wondrous beast is this almanac by a Puritan minister, an
astronomical calendar calculated for the region, with tide tables, the dates of court sessions and country fairs.
Unaffected verses for each month provide glimpses of New England life: July brings English supply ships,
"wooden birds" with bellies full of cloth and sugar; August is marked by clashes with Indians. A chronology of
notable events in the Massachusetts colony -- all 20 years of it -- records earthquakes and hurricanes, pirates
and the birth of American printing. Samuel Danforth predicts a solar eclipse, visible only in New Guinea and
the Solomon Islands. Here, in a few humble octavo leaves, the Puritan microcosm connects to the universe at
large.
4. Panacea
By Giles Everard
1659

--- Page 192 ---
Page 192 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The first seed of Caribbean tobacco -- milder than the local variety -- was planted in Virginia soil in 1612.
Within 20 years, the colony was producing more than 750 tons of tobacco annually, most of it for export;
tobacco became the engine of early America's economic growth. In "Panacea" (first published in Latin in
1587), Dutch doctor Giles Everard extols the "wonderful vertues" of tobacco in all its addictive potency.
Tobacco, he writes, is becoming "the meat and drink of many men, women and children," the stuff that keeps
scholars awake at their desks and soldiers on their guard. He explains its medical uses too, in unguents and
poultices, as well as in enemas that are so singularly effective against the wind colic that "King James merrily
said, 'that was the way to take it.'" If tobacco's smoke is abused by some, Everard insists, "the fault is not in
the leaf."
5. An Account of the Method and Success of Inoculating the Small-Pox . . .
By Cotton Mather
1722
Cotton Mather is best known for his incendiary influence on the Salem witch trials, but he was also an
intellectual omnivore, a prolific science writer whose interests included rainbows and rattlesnakes, cures for
syphilis and Indian methods of keeping time. Having witnessed the devastation of smallpox epidemics,
Mather was fascinated when one of his slaves told him of a form of inoculation practiced in his native Sudan.
Mather found writings on the subject by Turkish doctors and English scientists eager to try it, and he soon
threw his religious passion behind a campaign for inoculation trials in Boston. The campaign faced fierce
opposition, but American medical history was born here, in a conversation between a Puritan preacher and
his African slave.

To Prevent Bubbles, Restrain the Fed
To Prevent Bubbles, Restrain the Fed
By Gerald P. O'Driscoll Jr.

On Nov. 14, 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 8497.31. On Nov. 13, 1998, the adjusted (for
dividends and split) close was 8919.59. There has been great volatility, but no net capital accumulation as
measured by the Dow in a decade. Other indexes, such as the Nasdaq, tell a similar story. Capital has been
invested but as much value has been destroyed as created.
The U.S. cannot afford to have another lost decade. Or to see the dreams of another generation of
Americans who had been told to take responsibility for their financial health by investing in the stock market
dashed by failed monetary and fiscal polices.
Today, the most urgent task facing President-elect Barack Obama is stabilizing financial markets by
instituting policies that foster economic growth and prevent the type of boom and bust cycle that has just
wiped out a decade's worth of wealth accumulation.
Mr. Obama's task is made all the more difficult because there has been a perfect storm of bad policies and
practices. Laudable goals, such as fostering more homeownership, went terribly awry. Financial services
regulation has failed at its most basic task, protecting the soundness of the system. And a dysfunctional
compensation system has given corporate managers incentives to take excessive risks with investors'
money.
None of the policies and practices that are now widely criticized suddenly appeared in the past decade. But
they were kindling for a financial firestorm that needed only an accelerant and a spark. Both were provided by
a policy of easy money that came in response to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000-01, the ensuing
recession, and the Sept. 11 attacks.
At first Fed easing was in order. The central bank needed to counter the "irrational exuberance" of the
dot-com bubble. And by May of 2000 the Fed had done that by raising the fed-funds target to 6.5%. That
needed to come down when the bubble burst. Aggressive cutting brought it to 2% in November 2001.
The problem is the rate remained at 2% or less for three years (for a year it was at 1%). During most of this
period, the real (inflation-adjusted) fed-funds rate was negative. People were being paid to borrow and they
responded by often borrowing irresponsibly.
Consider subprime mortgages. In 2001, there was $190 billion worth of subprime loan originations -- 8.6% of
total mortgage originations. In 2005, there was $625 billion worth of subprime originations -- 20% of the total.
In the same period, the percentage of subprime mortgages securitized -- loans that were packaged and sold
to investors -- rose from just about 50% to a little more than 81%. (These numbers all trailed off slightly in
2006.) The great easing in monetary policy ended (with a lag) when the Fed began raising rates in June
2004.
The subprime saga follows a familiar pattern. Easy credit begets a boom and then the inevitable tightening of
credit bursts the bubble. What is not familiar is the scale of the devastation wrought in this boom-bust cycle.
Never before had financial markets evolved such a complex superstructure of interlinked securities,
derivatives of all kinds, and special-purpose investment vehicles. Professor Gary Gorton of the Yale School of
Management has best described that complexity in his paper "The Panic of 2007," published by the National
Bureau of Economic Research. He makes clear that as this system evolved there was not a sufficient guard
against systemic risk.
No president could want these events to repeat themselves on his watch. But they could be repeated.
The economy now confronts deflationary forces. If past is prologue the Fed will concentrate on those
deflationary forces for too long and rekindle an asset boom of some kind. The fiscal "stimulus" being
contemplated by Congress could be another economic accelerant. If both the fiscal and money stimulus

efforts kick in just as market forces also kick in, we're likely to see another unsustainable boom that will be
followed by a bust.
The incoming administration must think about that possibility because the timing of boom and bust cycles
seems to be shortening. The next bust could come five or six years from now -- or about in the middle of an
Obama second term. Should that happen, Mr. Obama would be unable to blame Republicans for the mess
and would be tagged as the second coming of Jimmy Charter.
To avoid such a fate, Mr. Obama needs to stop the next asset bubble from being inflated by imposing a
commodity standard on the Fed. A commodity standard (such as a gold standard) imposes discipline on a
central bank because it forces it to acquire commodity reserves in order to increase the money supply.
Today the government can inflate asset bubbles without paying a cost for it because the currency isn't linked
to the price of a commodity.
With a commodity standard in place, the government would also have price signals that would alert it to the
formation of a bubble. Why? Because the price of the commodity would be continuously traded in spot and
futures markets. Excessive easing by the Fed would be signaled by rising prices for the commodity. In recent
years, Fed officials have claimed that they cannot know when an asset bubble is developing. With a
commodity standard in place, it would be clear to anyone watching spot markets whether a bubble is forming.
What's more, if Fed officials ignored price signals, outflows of commodity reserves would force them to act
against the bubble.
The point is not to deflate asset bubbles, but to avoid them in the first place. Imposing a commodity standard
is a practical response to the repeated failures of central banks to maintain sound money and financial
stability. What would be impractical is to believe that the next time central banks will get it right on their own.

Stable Money Is the Key to Recovery

Tomorrow's "Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy" in Washington will have a stellar cast.
Leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations will be there, including Chinese President Hu
Jintao, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who initiated the whole affair, in order, as he put it, "to
build together the capitalism of the future," will be in attendance, along with the host, our own President
George W. Bush, and the chiefs of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations.
One thing is guaranteed: Most attendees will take the view that Wall Street greed and inadequate regulatory
oversight by U.S. authorities caused the global financial crisis -- never mind that their own regulatory
agencies missed the boat and that their own governments eagerly bought up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
securities for the higher yield over Treasurys.
But whatever they agree to pursue, whether new transnational regulatory authority or globally mandated limits
on executive remuneration, would only stultify prospects for economic recovery -- and completely miss the
point.
At the bottom of the world financial crisis is international monetary disorder. Ever since the post-World War II
Bretton Woods system -- anchored by a gold-convertible dollar -- ended in August 1971, the cause of free
trade has been compromised by sovereign monetary-policy indulgence.
Today, a soupy mix of currencies sloshes investment capital around the world, channeling it into stagnant
pools while productive endeavor is left high and dry. Entrepreneurs in countries with overvalued currencies
are unable to attract the foreign investment that should logically flow in their direction, while scam artists in
countries with undervalued currencies lure global financial resources into brackish puddles.
To speak of "overvalued" or "undervalued" currencies is to raise the question: Why can't we just have money
that works -- a meaningful unit of account to provide accurate price signals to producers and consumers
across the globe?
Consider this: The total outstanding notional amount of financial derivatives, according to the Bank for
International Settlements, is $684 trillion (as of June 2008) -- over 12 times the world's nominal gross
domestic product. Derivatives make it possible to place bets on future monetary policy or exchange-rate
movements. More than 66% of those financial derivatives are interest-rate contracts: swaps, options or
forward-rate agreements. Another 9% are foreign-exchange contracts.
In other words, some three-quarters of the massive derivatives market, which has wreaked the most havoc
across global financial markets, derives its investment allure from the capricious monetary policies of central
banks and the chaotic movements of currencies.
In the absence of a rational monetary system, investment responds to the perverse incentives of paper
profits. Meanwhile, price signals in the global marketplace are hopelessly distorted.
For his part, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says his essential goal is "to root out the irresponsible and
often undisclosed lending at the heart of our problems." But if anyone has demonstrated irresponsibility, it is
not those who chased misleading price signals in pursuit of false profits -- but rather global authorities who
have failed to provide an appropriate international monetary system to serve the needs of honest
entrepreneurs in an open world economy.
When President Richard Nixon closed the gold window some 37 years ago, it marked the end of a golden
age of robust trade and unprecedented global economic growth. The Bretton Woods system derived its
strength from a commitment by the U.S. to redeem dollars for gold on demand.

--- Page 196 ---
Page 196 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
True, the right of convertibility at a pre-established rate was granted only to foreign central banks, not to
individual dollar holders; therein lies the distinction between the Bretton Woods gold exchange system and a
classical gold standard. Under Bretton Woods, participating nations agreed to maintain their own currencies
at a fixed exchange rate relative to the dollar.
Since the value of the dollar was fixed to gold at $35 per ounce of gold -- guaranteed by the redemption
privilege -- it was as if all currencies were anchored to gold. It also meant all currencies were convertible into
each other at fixed rates.
Paul Volcker, former Fed chairman, was at Camp David with Nixon on that fateful day, Aug. 15, when the
system was ended. Mr. Volcker, serving as Treasury undersecretary for monetary affairs at the time, had
misgivings; and he has since noted that the inflationary pressures which caused us to go off the gold
standard in the first place have only worsened. Moreover, he suggests, floating rates undermine the
fundamental tenets of comparative advantage.
"What can an exchange rate really mean," he wrote in "Changing Fortunes" (1992), "in terms of everything a
textbook teaches about rational economic decision making, when it changes by 30% or more in the space of
12 months only to reverse itself? What kind of signals does that send about where a businessman should
intelligently invest his capital for long-term profitability? In the grand scheme of economic life first described
by Adam Smith, in which nations like individuals should concentrate on the things they do best, how can
anyone decide which country produces what most efficiently when the prices change so fast? The answer, to
me, must be that such large swings are a symptom of a system in disarray."
If we are to "build together the capitalism of the future," as Mr. Sarkozy puts it, the world needs sound money.
Does that mean going back to a gold standard, or gold-based international monetary system? Perhaps so;
it's hard to imagine a more universally accepted standard of value.
Gold has occupied a primary place in the world's monetary history and continues to be widely held as a
reserve asset. The central banks of the G-20 nations hold two-thirds of official world gold reserves; include
the gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Bank for
International Settlements, and the figure goes to nearly 80%, representing about 15% of all the gold ever
mined.
Ironically, it was French President Charles de Gaulle who best made the case in the 1960s. Worried that the
U.S. would be tempted to abuse its role as key currency issuer by exporting domestic inflation, he called for
the return to a classical international gold standard. "Gold," he observed, "has no nationality."
Mr. Sarkozy might build on that legacy if he can look beyond the immediacy of the crisis and work toward a
future global economy based on monetary integrity. This would indeed help to restore the values of
democratic capitalism. And Mr. Volcker, an influential adviser to President-elect Barack Obama, could turn
out to be a powerful ally in the pursuit of a new stable monetary order.

Large Stock Focus: Starbucks and AmEx Lead Stocks' Decline
Large Stock Focus: Starbucks and AmEx Lead Stocks' Decline
By Rob Curran

Stocks fell as American Express and Starbucks underscored the extent of the consumer-spending slowdown
in the U.S., while commodity stocks such as Devon Energy fell on concerns that not even the central bank of
China could jump-start demand world-wide.
Meanwhile, fears about the viability of the U.S. auto sector dragged General Motors to its lowest level since
World War II.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.58 points, or 2%, to 8693.96, within 520 points of the blue-chip
index's Oct. 27 five-and-a-half year closing low. The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index fell 20.26, or 2.2%, to
898.95. The Nasdaq Composite fell 35.84, or 2.2%, to 1580.90.
Typical of the recent stock-market slump, selling was broad, with all 30 Dow components declining.
American Express fell $1.58, or 6.6%, to $22.40 after the credit-card provider sought bank-holding status, a
move interpreted as a cry for government assistance under the bank bailout plan.
Starbucks (Nasdaq) fell 21 cents, or 2.1%, to 9.99 after the coffee-shop chain warned it was opening fewer
stores overseas than planned because of a plunge in fiscal-fourth-quarter profit. The chain, which built its
reputation on premium-priced drinks, also is planning to sell cut-rate holiday beverages.
Among financial stocks, Goldman Sachs Group rose 3.47, or 4.9%, to 74.68 as Sandler O'Neill raised its
rating to "buy" from "hold." Morgan Stanley shed 50 cents, or 3.4%, to 14.08.
"It doesn't seem to get any better, no matter how much money they throw at the financials," said a trader at a
midsize Wall Street firm. "Now [the crisis] has obviously contaminated the economy to a pretty severe extent,
and the layoff notices are coming fast and furious. The General Motors/Chrysler/Ford Motor saga is extremely
unnerving."
General Motors plunged 44 cents, or 13%, to 2.92. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives,
said she will push legislation next week that would qualify the auto industry for assistance from the
bank-bailout plan.
Ford Motor shed 13 cents, or 6.7%, to 1.80.
The housing sector, which was among the first to go into recession, is still on its knees. Toll Brothers shed
two cents to 18.93 after the luxury-home builder warned "preliminary signs of stability" in the housing market
in September were "upended" during the October financial crisis. Fourth-quarter revenue fell 41%.
Relief may be on its way for some homeowners: Citigroup fell 41 cents, or 3.7%, to 10.80 after the bank said
it is offering to modify the terms of as much as $20 billion in mortgages for borrowers in default or at risk of
falling behind. The bank addressed the mortgage issue as one of its economists noted the increasing
pressure of rising unemployment on borrowers.
Fannie Mae fell four cents, or 5.3%, to 68 cents; Freddie Mac fell six cents, or 6.8%, to 82 cents as the
mortgage-finance giants looked to speed up modification of hundreds of thousands of mortgages in an effort
to stave off more foreclosures.
Oil prices closed below $60 a barrel for the first time since March 2007. Driller Devon Energy fell 3.80, or
4.9%, to 74. The slide for oil and other commodity prices suggests a "disinflation" process is under way, as
the falloff in demand from consumers and commercial interests world-wide overshadows questions of supply,
driving prices down.
Shares of miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &Gold fell 2.68, or 9.8%, to 24.78, 81% from its peak.

Las Vegas Sands fell 2.66, or 33%, to 5.34 after the casino operator delayed developments in Macau and a
condominium project in Las Vegas, and raised capital in a dilutive sale of common and preferred equity and
warrants. Shares of the casino operator traded for more than $120 last December but have retreated as a
slowdown in consumer spending has caused lower revenue on the Las Vegas Strip.
MGM Mirage fell 1.30, or 10%, to 11.36.
A silver lining: American depositary shares of Vodafone Group rose 1.11, or 6.6%, to 17.87 after the British
cellphone provider cut its revenue projection but said it could boost its free cash flow through cost cuts.
Shares of Tyco fell 3.60, or 14%, to 21.74 after the industrial conglomerate warned that financing difficulties
and a stronger dollar caused customers to delay projects.

Commodity Currencies Take a Pounding

Commodity Currencies Take a Pounding

In currency markets gripped by turmoil, investors have targeted one group for special punishment: big
commodity exporters.
This cluster includes the currencies of countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which have
significant exports of natural resources and agricultural goods.
With the global economy headed toward recession, weakening demand for everything from oil to iron ore,
these currencies could face a further battering.
In many ways, these "commodity currencies" are bellwethers of global growth, soaring in good times and
tanking when the picture turns grim.
Monday, they got a brief shot in the arm from news of China's massive stimulus package, which could
generate demand for certain commodities. The Australian dollar strengthened against the U.S. dollar before
retreating. It is down more than 30% versus the buck since mid-July.
In October, the Canadian dollar had its worst month ever against the greenback, falling 12%, effectively
erasing more than three years of gains. The New Zealand dollar has lost about a quarter of its value against
the U.S. dollar since July.
When commodity prices fall, it translates into a shock for the trading position of commodity-exporting nations.
Suddenly, the price they earn for their exports falls relative to what they pay for their imports. That means
their trade balances deteriorate and their economies suffer as income from exports declines.
Commodity currencies did mount a minor recovery in late October and early November as investors tiptoed
back into battered assets. Other factors also influence these currencies, of course, from investment flows to
developments in each country's domestic economy.
Still, their special link to commodities makes them susceptible to more pain. A precedent exists for further
falls in commodity prices: Despite the recent drop, commodity prices remain well above the lows touched in
the two last global recessions.
China, with its appetite for imported natural resources, is a focus for worry. "If this cycle is vicious enough and
China gets into trouble, this could be very, very powerful," says Stephen Jen, head of currency research at
Morgan Stanley.
He singles out the Australian dollar as especially vulnerable. "The low that we saw back in 2001 shouldn't be
ruled out," Mr. Jen says.
Back then, one Australian dollar fetched less than 50 U.S. cents. Late Monday in New York, it bought about
67 cents, down from more than 97 cents in July. Prices for certain Australian exports, like copper, wheat,
aluminum and nickel have slumped.
The economic link between the currencies of commodity exporters and the prices of such exports has
prompted economists to ask whether the former might predict the latter. The reasoning: Investors will
incorporate their expectations about movements in commodity prices into their trading of these currencies.
In a recent paper, economists Yu-chin Chen, Kenneth Rogoff and Barbara Rossi examined quarterly moves
in the currencies of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and South Africa over the past one to three
decades. They found that each currency helped forecast the prices of its country's main commodity exports.
Together, the currencies were a surprisingly good indicator of how a broad index of commodities would
perform in the following quarter.

--- Page 200 ---
Page 200 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
For the third quarter, the model based on the currencies forecast a fall of roughly 9% in commodity prices,
despite their strong performance earlier in the year. It got the change in direction correct, but not quite the
magnitude: A broad commodity index from the International Monetary Fund was down 18% in the third
quarter; excluding energy, it was down 12%.
Given the severity of the current turmoil in global markets, using historical patterns to forecast commodity
prices mightn't be of much use at the moment, cautioned Ms. Chen, an economist at the University of
Washington.
Among emerging markets, there are several currencies with strong links to commodities, among them the
Chilean peso, which moves with copper prices, and the South African rand, which has ties to gold and
minerals like platinum. The Russian ruble also has benefited from the soaring price of crude oil.
Some experts caution that the recent thumping taken by commodity currencies may be overkill. Robert
Sinche, head of global currency strategy at Bank of America, says that the Australian dollar may have been
unduly punished from a medium-term perspective.
Economic growth in Australia is projected to slow markedly in the year to next June, to 1.5%, according to the
country's central bank. That isn't a great figure, but still better than in other advanced economies.
But with currency markets so unsettled and many investors still on the sidelines, making bets is difficult.
"Even if some of these currencies look considerably cheap, the volatility is just immense," says Jens Nordvig,
a currency strategist at Goldman Sachs.

Andrew Wilson is right: The New Deal did not end the Great Depression ("Five Myths About the Great
Depression," op-ed, Nov. 4). No less an authority than FDR's Treasury secretary and close friend, Henry
Morgenthau, conceded this fact to Congressional Democrats in May 1939: "We have tried spending money.
We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest,
and if I am wrong . . . somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see
people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises . . . I
say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started . . . And
an enormous debt to boot!" Indeed, FDR's market-suffocating policies are almost surely what put the "Great"
in Great Depression.

I am concerned that we are following the lead of 1930s failures into another depression. In response to a
financial crisis, President Herbert Hoover raised taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals and instituted
protectionist tariffs, thereby escalating the crisis into a depression. Franklin Roosevelt followed with the New
Deal which destroyed business incentives and extended the Depression for over 10 years. That Depression
led directly to World War II which was the greatest social, environmental and economic crisis the world has
ever seen. President-elect Barack Obama campaigned on many of these same measures.
Capitalism has served America incredibly well for over 200 years. The current crisis resulted primarily from
anticapitalists forcing banks and mortgage companies to lend money to people with little or no means to pay it
back. That is not capitalism. Now, many say capitalist principles have failed. No way! It was the tinkering, with
blatant disregard for capitalist principles, that failed and we should get back to what works: Reduce taxes on
businesses and expand individual tax cuts. This will energize our economy and create a flood of tax revenue
which would allow America to truly address the needs of the poor here and overseas. So what if it allows rich
people to keep their money. Do we want to punish them so much that we are willing to sacrifice our country
and make everyone poor?

I am always surprised that the loss of exports is not given more credence as a factor in the Depression.
Exports declined by $5 billion between 1929 and 1933.
The average wage was $1,000, so this meant a loss of five million direct jobs and over 12.5 million in total.
The Fed should have tried to maintain price stability as it was mandated to do. But could any policy have
replaced that loss? Those jobs were replaced and the Depression ended when exports picked up as France
and Britain rearmed. France was occupied and Britain ran out of money, so the give-away Lend Lease
program allowed exports to carry on.
The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 required Britain to repay loans in gold. There was no money to pay for
U.S. exports after 1929. Before 1929 we had exported capital in the form of loans. Exports collapsed when
they ceased in 1929.

Goldman's Options for a New Era
Goldman Sachs Group faces a grim milestone. The Wall Street firm needs to fall only a further 10% to get
back to the closing share price on its first day of trading as a public company in 1999.
That is perfectly feasible, given how the firm's stock has underperformed even during recent market rallies --
despite Goldman being strengthened by a government guarantee on debt issuances and around $20 billion of
new capital.
As Goldman probably heads for its first quarterly loss as a public company, investors appear more worried
about the bank's ability to make a decent return on its capital than liquidity fears. It now trades 10% below its
tangible net worth, including recent capital raisings.
If Goldman believes the pessimism will pass, it may decide to soldier on with its new hoard of capital as an
independent firm. Indeed, it still trades at a far richer multiple than rival Morgan Stanley, which trades at 54%
of tangible book.
But the risk is that the business environment gets even worse and the share price falls still further. Just as
Goldman might advise clients, it also needs to consider more radical options.
What might they be?
One idea being floated is to take the firm private. While that has a certain symmetry, given the share-price
performance, it would be almost impossible because of the difficulty in funding a buyout and the ongoing
business in today's environment.
Another option would be a breakup, separating the highly regarded advisory business from more volatile
trading operations and hedge-fund businesses. However, unlike two years ago, such businesses hardly
command attractive valuations. And there would be no easy or cheap way to support the "black box" trading
operations once they were split off.
The final option is a merger or big strategic partnership.
Buying a bank might help Goldman acquire deposits to provide more stable funding. The trouble is, most
banks nowadays also come with a dodgy loan book. And, given the size of Goldman's balance sheet, it would
need a lot of deposits to make a difference. If it wanted to fund, say, 40% of its $363 billion of financial assets
that aren't in collateralized arrangements, it would need more than $140 billion of deposits.
A merger with a big securities business, like State Street, meanwhile, might add stability. But its superior
valuation multiple to Goldman would make it tough to do.
That leaves Goldman putting itself up for sale. Again, there are few banks with the stomach and cash to pay
$30 billion or more for Goldman right now. At a lower price they may bite. But, they would need to be pretty
sure that they wouldn't destroy Goldman's powerful culture.
For now Goldman is likely to try soldiering on alone. But the firm needs to map out plan B.
-- Peter Eavis and Liam Denning
Gold's Deflating Decline Augurs More Ills
Goldbugs must feel cheated. Like their close relatives, the peak oilers, they enjoyed a banner start to 2008: It
looked like the world was simultaneously ending and running out of oil.

--- Page 205 ---
Page 205 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
It is hard to burn through the world's natural resources when the economy is grinding to a halt, though. Gold
peaked at just above $1,000 an ounce in March. Oil peaked in July.
There is still plenty of fear around -- just look at the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index for
stocks, or VIX. Yet gold is 26% below its peak.
Gold's fall (and oil's slower, but even sharper, decline) heralds the onset of disinflation. Ahmad Abdallah, an
analyst at financial-services firm GaveKal, highlights the long-term, inverse relationship between the gold
price and real interest rates.
Right now, with consumer-price inflation running at 4.9% and Treasury bills yielding less than 1%, real
interest rates are negative. This should be supportive of gold. That it isn't suggests real rates are set to
head back toward positive territory. Since major central banks won't jack up nominal interest rates, it is
prices that will give way, as consumption contracts world-wide. Friday's shocking unemployment data fit that
scenario.
Gold's fall also suggests that, despite a raft of reflationary initiatives, the banking sector's problems mean the
transmission mechanism to the rest of the economy remains broken.
As Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of macro hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund puts it: "Gold is again a barometer
of how well the 'reflation attempt' by the Fed and government is working and when it seems to be working,
both gold and stocks should be up. . . . If it doesn't work, you will see gold and stocks down together."
-- Liam Denning and Rob Curran
Detroit's New Labor Pains
Today's puzzler is this: If two cars set off simultaneously toward each other from Detroit and Washington, will
they break down before they meet?
General Motors reported another huge quarterly loss Friday. But in remarkably frank language, the auto
maker also said cash balances could fall below the minimum necessary to keep the business going early next
year.
Since GM is negotiating for a federal bailout, it is easy to dismiss this as a scare tactic.
But this doesn't look like a bluff. Together, GM and rival Ford Motor, which also reported earnings Friday,
burned through 26% of their cash and equivalents last quarter.
Moreover, the economy is deteriorating rapidly. October's payroll data, released Friday, showing 240,000 job
losses, was bad enough. Worse was the revision to the prior two months' data, adding 179,000 to the ranks
of the unemployed.
Average duration of unemployment is rising, as is the proportion of Americans in part-time work. And this all
comes heading into a recession, not coming out of it, as in 2001.
Until now, a saving grace for auto makers was that while Americans might hand in the keys to a submerged
property, they needed their cars to get to work. The rising jobless total will add pressure for Washington to
speed to Detroit's rescue -- while also ensuring other sectors call for aid.
-- Liam Denning
Broadcast
Blues Hit
Media Firms
The TV industry today is like a tale of two cities.
Earnings from big media companies this past week showed cable channels are comfortably surviving the
economic slowdown. Broadcasters? Not so much.
Discovery Communications reported Friday higher profit from its cable networks. Cable channels owned by
Walt Disney, Time Warner and News Corp. each delivered double-digit percentage growth.
While Viacom had a slight drop in cable-network profit, that was nothing compared with the broadcasters.
Disney lost $150 million in its broadcast segment, which includes ABC network. News Corp.'s broadcast-TV
operating income fell 70%. (News Corp. also owns The Wall Street Journal.) CBS's TV segment fell 17%.

--- Page 206 ---
Page 206 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
This has little to do with viewing trends and everything to do with distribution.
Since cable networks effectively share in fees that households pay to cable and satellite operators, they have
been insulated from the severity of the downturn. Time Warner's TNT, for example, earned $1.02 billion in
fees last year, estimates SNL Kagan. Broadcast networks, in contrast, get paid through advertising -- much of
which is routed through TV stations.
That made sense when stations were the sole distribution medium. But the rise of cable and satellite has
made stations largely redundant. Now TV station profits are being walloped by the economic slump.
In the past year some network owners have sold TV stations. Some are pushing for cash payments from
cable operators. If the networks can get enough cash from that, they could afford to jettison their TV stations
entirely. Then the TV storyline might make some sense.
-- Martin Peers
Overheard
As if you needed confirmation that the private-equity business stinks right now, a senior executive in the
industry had this to say when asked recently about the grim state of play in the leveraged buyout, or LBO,
business: "Well, when you don't have the 'L,'" he said, "all you've got is BO."
---
Talk about rubbing it in.
Here's Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer scotching talk he would make another offer for Yahoo. "We made an
offer, we made another offer, and it was clear that Yahoo didn't want to sell the business to us and we moved
on," he said, according to the Associated Press. "We are not interested in going back and re-looking at an
acquisition. I don't know why they would be either, frankly. They turned us down at $33 a share."
Ouch. Yahoo stock plunged 13% to $12.20 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

World News: Metals Prices, Swelling Deficit Pose Threats to South Africa
World News: Metals Prices, Swelling Deficit Pose Threats to South Africa

JOHANNESBURG -- South Africa hasn't had to bail out its banks, but a gaping financial deficit and slumping
metals prices have some investors worried that the nation -- Africa's economic engine -- remains vulnerable
in the global financial crisis.
The current-account deficit, a broad measure of the country's trade and financial dealings with the rest of the
world, got another blow with a report the trade deficit in September swelled to 7.11 billion rand ($729 million)
from a 5.12 billion-rand shortfall the month before.
"South Africans are often too cavalier about their current-account deficit," said Michael Power, an investment
strategist at Cape Town-based Investec Asset Management. "True, it does not matter until it matters. Then it
matters a lot."
Metals prices, a key component of South Africa's exports, were hit hard in October, with gold prices falling
18%, silver down 21% and copper off 37%. Metals rallied early this week but stumbled again Wednesday,
falling along with equities markets.
The concerns are weighing on the rand, which last month fell to a six-and-a-half-year low of 11.88 to the
dollar, although it has since recovered to around 10 to the dollar. Meanwhile, Johannesburg's blue-chip Top
40 index dropped about 12% in October.
South Africa's central bank says the country's banks are well-capitalized, and Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel has said the economy will be shielded from the worst of the global crisis.
Jacob Zuma, head of the ruling African National Congress party and likely South Africa's next president,
recently made a trip to the U.S. he said was aimed partly at allaying fears investors may have.
"In South Africa we are also feeling the impact of [the global financial crisis], but we believe that our economic
policies and particularly the financial discipline has to some degree helped us to be a shock absorber of the
impact itself," he said.
In the crisis, "the issue of financial discipline, how we manage our budget, becomes very, very important,"
said ANC Treasurer General Matthews Phosa, who accompanied Mr. Zuma. "Yes, our banking system has
been so far a bit insulated from the big waves, but our economy is not. Our economy is definitely frontally
affected."
South Africa's economy slowed substantially this year. The National Treasury recently forecast growth of
3.7% for 2008 after an average of about 5% in the last four years.
But the slowdown was already evident in January as industry struggled with electricity shortages. South
Africans also were being pinched before the U.S. subprime-lending trouble, with interest-rate increases aimed
at countering rising inflation. A new National Credit Act forced lenders to be stricter in their practices.
"Both encouraged the process of deleveraging well before the exaggerated swings in the market forced the
process on the country," said Razia Khan, regional head of research at Standard Chartered in London.
"Does South Africa belong in the same category as Hungary or Iceland? Fundamentally, I would think not,"
she said.
Nevertheless, unemployment is high, the country's politics are uncertain ahead of national elections next year
and metals prices are a big question for the longer term.

"If the global economy is going into a recession, even a depression according to some, then you can imagine
what will happen to commodity prices," said Abri du Plessis, chief investment officer at South Africa's
Gryphon Asset Management, which manages more than 5 billion rand in assets.

SPAIN
Officials Refuse Asylum
For Osama bin Laden's Son
Spain rejected an asylum request from a son of Osama bin Laden, deciding he hadn't met requirements.
Omar Osama bin Laden, 27 years old, flew to Spain this week and remains in a transit area at Madrid's
Barajas Airport, an Interior Ministry official said. He has 24 hours to appeal. The official wouldn't elaborate or
discuss the younger Mr. bin Laden's reasons for seeking asylum.
The Spanish official said that the government usually seeks a recommendation from the U.N. refugee agency
in asylum requests, and that the agency recommended against asylum. Omar Osama bin Laden is one of the
al Qaeda leader's 19 children. He arrived in Madrid on Monday on a flight from Cairo, traveling on a Saudi
passport.

EURO ZONE
ECB Rate Cut Is Expected
Amid New Grim Data
Europe's economic outlook darkened, bolstering economists' expectations that the European Central Bank
will cut interest rates by half a percentage point Thursday. Analysts also predicted the Bank of England
could cut its key rate by as much as a full percentage point.
Service-sector activity in the euro zone shrank at its fastest pace in 10 years in October, according to the
Markit Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index, as tight financing weighed on business activity and companies
slashed prices. Retail sales across the 15-country euro area fell in September, as increased fears of job
losses made consumers more wary of spending.

Bombing of Wedding Party

The U.S. military said it was investigating the deaths from a bombing in Kandahar province, where residents

A villager said U.S. forces gave them permission to bury the dead, which he said included 23 children and 10
women. A U.S. spokesman, Cmdr. Jeff Bender, added that "if innocent people were killed in this operation,
we apologize and express our condolences."
President Hamid Karzai spoke about the attack at a news conference in which he implored President-elect
Barack Obama to halt such attacks once he takes office.

Canadian miner Crystallex's effort to develop one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America came to an
end after President Hugo Chavez's government said it is taking back the Las Cristinas project.
The mining ministry said the Las Cristinas gold mine "will be recovered and will be operated by the state,"
starting in 2009. Crystallex said the company had not received any official notification from the government.

COLOMBIA
Arms Dealer's Lawyers Say
He Was Working for U.S.
A Syrian arms dealer accused of agreeing to sell weapons to Colombian rebels was in fact providing
information to Spanish intelligence officers who were targeting the group, defense lawyers said Wednesday.
Monzer al-Kassar is charged with conspiring to sell millions of dollars in weapons to the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.
In opening arguments at Manhattan federal court, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan McGuire said the U.S.
government hired undercover operatives to pose as FARC arms buyers and to videotape their negotiations
with Mr. Kassar and a second defendant, Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy, 59.

Some Trend-Following Funds Are Winners in Rough Market

Chasing the latest market fad isn't all bad.
Some investment funds that jump on trends are outperforming traders who pride themselves on outthinking
the market. Increased volatility in markets from commodities to stocks is helping the trend followers profit.
A particular category of trend-following funds called managed futures funds have outperformed hedge funds
this year by making a killing from the dollar's rally, the plummet of emerging markets and the collapse of
commodities.
With $234.1 billion in assets, these funds gained 8.9% year to date through October, while the average hedge
fund lost 18.9%, according to preliminary data from research firm Barclay Hedge. Barclay, which isn't related
to Barclays PLC, doesn't consider managed futures funds to be hedge funds, though other data trackers do.
At managed futures funds, traders typically use customized trading algorithms to spot market trends and
place bets on futures and other derivatives. Instead of focusing on fundamental supply and demand, traders
wait for their system to signal whether it is time to enter or exit from the market. When a trend reverses,
trading systems are supposed to be quick to spot the change and move in another direction.
Most managed futures funds, which are often referred to as commodity-trading advisers, are less than $1
billion in size, though some are larger. The sector's heavyweight players include Man Group PLC's $24.9
billion AHL program, Winton Capital Management's $15.7 billion fund and Campbell &Co.'s FME Large
Portfolio with $4.7 billion in assets, according to Altegris Investments, a research firm.
In recent years, when volatility was lower, many managed futures funds underperformed the average hedge
fund. They trailed the average hedge fund every year from 2003 to 2007 when stocks moved up steadily,
according to Barclay Hedge. Also, because these funds are trend followers, they tend to take a hit initially
when the trend reverses.
In August 2007, as the credit crunch emerged, managed futures funds plunged 4.6% when hedge funds were
just down 1.5%, according to Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index.
But managed futures funds can fare particularly well in times of wild and extended price swings, in part
because computers can make calculated, emotionless reversals to seize on market changes that human
traders may be slower to accept.
"We are not going to be the first to get in or the first to get out, but we are generally able to capture 80% of
the trends," says Paul Wigdor, managing director of Superfund USA Inc., which runs two managed futures
funds in the U.S. together holding about $100 million. They are up 39% and 26.3% this year through October.
All of the six managed-futures funds run by John W. Henry &Co., founded by Boston Red Sox baseball-team
owner John W. Henry, were up this year, with the largest one -- the $161 million GlobalAnalytics -- up 72.4%
through October. The success is because of "the dramatic moves both to the upside and the downside we
have seen," across the board, says Ken Webster, the company's president.
This fall, wild swings are the rule, rather than the exception. Volatility in commodity markets is hovering at or
close to all-time highs. Crude prices are at their most volatile this decade, fluctuating in a range that put them
as high as $147 in July and in the low $60s last week.
Volatility levels of gold, copper, nickel, lead, corn and soybeans are now at or have recently hit higher levels
than at nearly any other point this decade, according to Morgan Stanley data. The level of volatility in the S&P
GSCI commodity index, a widely watched basket of commodity prices, reached 50.4% last month through
Oct. 30, compared with 23.1% over the past 10 years, according to Barclays Capital, a unit of Barclays PLC.

Stocks -- and thus the values of stock indexes that managed futures funds are likely to trade -- have been
even more volatile. According to Barclays, the level of volatility in the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index hit
82.4% in the same period, compared with a 10-year average of 19.6%. "These markets have been
extraordinarily difficult to trade," says Kevin Norrish, an analyst at Barclays Capital. As commodities got
crushed in October, trend-following programs largely worked, because "it just paid to be short."
Barclays attributes the volatility in part to a reduction of risk by many types of traders. As more players exit
from the market, fewer buyers and sellers are left and the market has less liquidity, leading to bigger price
swings. Some say managed futures funds can sometimes exacerbate trends by piling onto those moves.
Clarke Capital Management Inc., which runs nine managed futures funds, has been among the best
performers this year. Its largest, $72.2 million Millennium program gained 82.2% through October, says
Michael Clarke, president of the Hinsdale, Ill., company. Millennium trades a mixture of 48 futures including
grains, metals, currencies and interest rates, and it has three time frames with various stop limits, or
maximum losses that will trigger the exit from a position.
One successful bet it made this summer was in energy: The fund started shorting crude oil when it hovered
around $130 and $140 a barrel, then stayed with the trade down to $80 before getting out. "We collected the
bulk of the move," Mr. Clarke said. The fund has stayed out of energy for weeks, as its system hasn't
detected any entering signals.
At Virgin Islands-based Drury Capital Inc., which runs seven managed futures funds, the largest with $154.2
million in assets, traders started selling short S&P 500 index futures in November 2007. The index is down
about 36% since then; the largest Drury fund was up 56.9% through October.
Mr. Henry has been profiting from the recent moves in energy and the rally of the dollar.

Yahoo's Search for Salvation
Jerry Yang is digging himself into an ever-deeper hole.
The Yahoo chief executive's latest effort to keep the company independent, disclosed Monday, is a proposal
to outsource just 25% of Yahoo's search-advertising revenue to Google for just two years.
This half-baked plan is worse than his original idea: to outsource an unlimited amount of Yahoo's search
advertising to Google for 10 years. That plan, which ran into government opposition, would likely have
allowed Google to cement its domination in search. But in return, Yahoo would have significantly boosted its
search-ad revenue, giving it breathing room to put the rest of its house in order.
Now Yahoo is essentially cutting back on its competition with Google, without getting much in return. With
only 25% of revenue from Google's more-efficient ad engine, Yahoo won't get a huge sales boost, but will
have less incentive to invest in improving its own search technology.
Yahoo, meanwhile, needs to revive its lucrative display-advertising business. Yahoo still has a chance to
dominate the market for online display ads -- those big graphical ads that can take up more than a quarter of
a Web page. But it has pursued a misguided advertising strategy, combining its search- and
display-advertising sales forces and focusing on technology to try to boost the rates of lower-priced ads
running across the entire site.
The strategic change meant Yahoo neglected its core business of selling premium ads on its front page and
lucrative section fronts such as Yahoo Finance. Amid the turmoil, Yahoo's respected ad chief, Wenda Harris
Millard, left the company with other top talent, taking with them some of their cozy relationships with Madison
Avenue marketers.
An overall downturn in online display advertising and increased inventory from high-traffic rivals such as
social-networking sites has further hurt Yahoo. The company has hired Microsoft's longtime ad sales
executive Joanne Bradford to turn the situation around. But that is a big task, which could be muddied further
by a partial reliance on Google.
Yahoo doesn't have many good options. A deal with AOL would simply yoke two sinking properties together,
possibly making them sink faster. Traditional media companies that have sniffed around Yahoo are too weak
themselves to make a bid. And, given the economic weakness, any Yahoo recovery could be far off.
Shareholder patience will be finite. Earlier this year, Yahoo failed to grab Microsoft's discussed $33-per-share
offer. Now, Microsoft might be able to snap up a weakened Yahoo, which is trading at about $13, for closer to
$20. Having fought Microsoft so hard, Mr. Yang faces the prospect of being forced back to Microsoft chief
Steve Ballmer to lift him out of his hole.

Great Fall of China Hits Banks' Stakes
With the global economy slowing, this isn't the nicest time to hold large, illiquid stakes in Chinese banks. Just
ask Goldman Sachs Group and Bank of America.
Goldman and affiliates held a $7.14 billion stake in Industrial &Commercial Bank of China at the end of
August, while Bank of America's investment in China Construction Bank was valued at $14.5 billion at the end
of September.

--- Page 214 ---
Page 214 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
ICBC's shares are down 30% since the end of August, the close of Goldman's fiscal third quarter. The bank's
investment doesn't track exactly with the stock price. But at these levels, the slide in ICBC shares could
translate into a mark-to-market loss in excess of $1.5 billion so far this quarter.
CCB's shares are down 21% since the end of September. Applying that decline to Bank of America's position
suggests a paper loss of around $3 billion.
Such losses need to be seen in context. Taking stakes in Chinese banks made sense for lots of reasons --
even with the restrictions that have prevented the banks from selling or hedging the investments for agreed
periods. Both investments are still up substantially and will no doubt turn a solid profit in the long run,
especially when dividend income is counted. The banks also might argue that these stakes are worth having,
despite their volatility, since they provide invaluable business relationships and insight into China.
But the size of the investments is what makes them a headache right now. Using the last public values, the
stakes are equivalent to roughly 10% of Goldman's shareholder equity and around 7% of Bank of America's,
after recent capital raisings for both banks.
Given those numbers, Goldman and Bank of America must dread a sharp slowdown in China.

Joke's on BMW, Daimler
Jokes about how bankers can no longer afford luxury German cars make the rounds when financial markets
go sour. What's odd is that executives at some of the leading car makers haven't seen the black humor as a
leading indicator.
BMW and Daimler, owner of Mercedes, have only just acknowledged that sales this year won't match 2007's
strong performance. That's despite months of market turmoil and gloomy economic indicators. The
companies' latest profit warnings contrast with a relatively upbeat outlook for their businesses, if not the
industry at large, a month ago.
In their defense, BMW and Mercedes had a deceptively comforting first nine months of the year. Strong
demand for BMW's Mini and for both companies in China offset weak U.S. sales, which worsened
substantially last month.
But the latest figures suggest it's not just the economy that explains the slump in demand for BMW and
Mercedes because forecasts at Audi, Volkswagen's luxury marque, remain robust. Product cycle and
geographic spread are also important. Audi, for example, sells relatively few cars in the slumping U.S.
market, and is benefiting from new models.
That said, the next time a German auto executive hears the one about the difference between a pigeon and a
banker -- the bird can still leave a deposit on a BMW -- he should take note.

Election Has
Clear Winner:
The Markets
With all eyes focused on Washington, New York staged its election party early. Even foreign markets saw a
noisy return to risk.
Tuesday's rally, as Americans went to the polls, was unusually broad based. Oil surged, gold rallied,
Treasury yields fell, and global stock markets jumped.
Any notion that investors were "relieved" at the end of the election campaign, thereby lifting the fog of
uncertainty, is bogus. The near-term outlook for the U.S. economy hasn't changed -- it remains as dire as it
did last week. Recession hurts earnings. Even Wall Street's analysts have started to grasp that, with the
consensus for S&P 500 earnings growth in 2009 slashed from 22.3% on Oct. 17 to a still optimistic 14.8% by
last Friday, according to Thomson Reuters.
For all the differences in each candidate's economic-policy promises, it has also been clear that Washington
will continue to throw money at the problem. Whether that comes via tax cuts, public investment or more
bailouts, it means mounting government deficits.

--- Page 215 ---
Page 215 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
That's one reason why the rally in Treasurys, in particular, looks anomalous. Public spending, meanwhile,
should help stocks but it must be weighed against the potential for more regulation and higher corporate or
even windfall taxes.
The measure it really paid to watch on Tuesday was one that actually fell: the CBOE volatility index, or VIX.
The fear gauge fell 11%. That represents relief of sorts. But at 47.7, it is still more than double the 10-year
average. President Obama's first months should remain good for day-traders, at least.
-- Liam Denning
Overheard
The Securities and Exchange Commission has shown it doesn't have the strongest grasp on the markets, but
the English language, too? The SEC is calling its new short-selling disclosure regulation an "interim final
temporary rule." If you understand that, you probably structure CDO-squareds.

The New York Fed has hired Michael Alix into its bank supervision group. Mr. Alix's last job: chief risk officer
for Bear Stearns. At least he might have some knowledge to share on the $30 billion Bear portfolio the Fed
took on.

Carl Icahn's retreat from Lear Corp., reducing his stake to 4.95% from 16%, echoed Kirk Kerkorian's decision
to cut his stake in Ford Motor to below 5%. That is the threshold above which investors have to report every
sale. Both men might feel happier managing their positions away from prying eyes.

No Treasure in 10-Year Notes
To paraphrase Churchill, the 10-year Treasury note right now is an enigma wrapped in a mystery, contained
in a riddle.
A big head-scratcher for investors is figuring out the appropriate yield on such government bonds. They
yielded 3.97% Friday, up from an October low of 3.43%.
On paper, that increase shouldn't be happening. The Federal Reserve is expected to take its fed-funds target
rate below 1%. And, this past week, a range of economic indicators proved that the recession is real and
getting worse.
Seeing that, investors might be expected to pile into the 10-year, pushing its yield down to 3% or lower, in the
belief that deflation is a real threat and interest rates will just keep heading lower. In other words, the 10-year
Treasury would start mimicking the 10-year Japanese government bond. Over the past 10 years, a period
when Japan's economy has sputtered along, the yield on 10-year JGBs has rarely gone above 2%.
Why isn't that happening?
One interpretation is that government bond investors simply don't think the U.S. is entering a deflationary lost
decade. They see all the things the Fed and the U.S. Treasury have done to prevent collapse and are betting
that, after a recession, the economy recovers. That means inflation could return as a factor -- and to
compensate for that risk over 10 years, the bond needs to yield more than the historically low rate of 3.97%.
There is a darker viewpoint: Investors will demand relatively high yields on longer-term Treasurys even if the
U.S. economy continues to weaken.
Two things could keep yields high. First, the U.S. relies on foreigners to finance its current account deficit. It
may have to pay up to maintain foreign buying of U.S. government bonds. Japan never had this weakness.
Second, bond buyers -- seeing how much money the authorities are throwing around -- expect the volume of
government debt to skyrocket.
That could be exacerbated by the government's recent moves to guarantee large amounts of bank and
agency debt. If investors believe in those backstops, the yield between such securities and Treasurys should
move closer, potentially pushing up Treasury yields.
The sticking point in Japan was that monetary easing and capital injections into banks didn't translate into a
big pickup in lending. That might be different in the U.S. because the authorities have moved quickly, though
the preceding credit boom was arguably worse, making the bust harder to neutralize and the potential effects
on the real economy more severe.
With coming economic data set to show serious weakness, 10-year yields could well retreat again short term.
But on a three-year view, with the U.S. determined to reflate the economy at almost any cost, and borrow
heavily to do so, 10-year Treasurys are no safe bet.
-- Peter Eavis
Disney Could Raise Its Game With EA
Memo to Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger: Is it time to grab Electronic Arts?
The company, a premier name in videogames, may be getting cheap enough. With the stock down 18%
Friday on disappointing second-quarter earnings, EA's market value is $7.2 billion, down from $19 billion a
few years ago.

--- Page 217 ---
Page 217 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
On the surface that still isn't inexpensive, given EA's lowered guidance for fiscal 2009. At Friday's closing
price of $22.78, the stock is trading at roughly 20 times revised earnings estimates (adjusted for various
items). But stripping out the $2.5 billion of cash and marketable securities on EA's balance sheet at Sept. 30
reduces the effective cost per share to roughly $15.06, putting the multiple closer to 14. And earnings should
rebound in fiscal 2010 when EA releases its Harry Potter game.
Any entertainment company could be interested in EA, given continued growth in videogame sales, the
potential for cross-fertilization with TV and film storylines and advertisers' interest in buying space in games.
Disney makes the most sense. EA's biggest assets include its sports games, such as Madden NFL, which
would fit with Disney's ESPN cable network. Disney could also save at least part of the roughly $200 million it
spends annually to develop its own games.
Disney could afford it. At June 30, its net debt was $11 billion, roughly 1.2 times Pali Research's estimate of
2008 earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortization. Also, Disney's stock has widely
outperformed EA's this year. At a 40% premium, EA would cost $7.7 billion excluding the cash.
Disney would be gutsy to step up during the current economic uncertainty. But it might be better than waiting
for better times and paying top dollar.
-- Martin Peers
Preference Isn't L'Oreal
"I may be worth it, but I can't afford it." That's the unnerving message consumers sent L'Oreal about its luxury
and middle-market hair dyes, lipsticks and skin creams in the third quarter.
But it isn't just a tough economy that explains the French company's slack sales and profit warning, which
contrasts with a more-robust picture at rivals Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever, selling cheaper products.
L'Oreal also may have misread the market and let advertising and promotion budgets slip, just as it needed to
win over pinched consumers. The company has promised a burst ofsuch spending to support its popular
brands, but that will hurt margins. A mix of rising costs and sluggish demand also is likely to weigh on
performance through 2009.
Meanwhile, the downturn is testing L'Oreal's shift to a more acquisitive growth strategy in recent years. Body
Shop, the U.K.-based natural products company L'Oreal bought for GBP 652 million ($1.07 billion) in 2006, is
a small part of its overall business, but it is hardly pulling its weight. Sales were flat in the nine months to
Sept. 30.
L'Oreal's shares have enjoyed a premium to its nearest rivals, trading at 15 times estimated 2009 earnings
before the latest announcement, compared with 12 times for Estee Lauder and 11 for Unilever. That premium
seems increasingly difficult to justify.

Barclays
Pays A Price
For Freedom
Few banks have done as much twisting and turning in the past 18 months as Barclays. The British bank has
picked its way through global banking turmoil and is emerging in one piece -- just about.
But Barclays shareholders have paid a price for management's determination to retain the bank's
independence and reject funds from the British government. Two Gulf investors stepped in instead, buying
GBP 3 billion ($4.94 billion) of reserve capital instruments. The 14% coupon compares with the 12% on
preferred stock other banks are issuing to the U.K. government.
Barclays also has placed GBP 4.3 billion in mandatory convertible notes with investors. They pay a 9.75%
coupon and will convert at 153 pence, a 22.5% discount to Barclays' average stock price Wednesday and
Thursday.
Those numbers aren't quite as punitive as they look. The coupon on the RCIs is tax deductible so Barclays
says the net cost is closer to 10%. But when the attached warrants are priced, that climbs back to 13%.

--- Page 218 ---
Page 218 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Barclays does spare itself the months it would take to get an orthodox rights issue off the ground. And it ends
up with a Tier 1 ratio of about 11.3%. While not as robust as Credit Suisse's 13.7%, that is stronger than the
other European banks that haven't taken state funds.
Barclays believes this is a competitive advantage, coupled with having Lehman Brothers' U.S. assets under
its belt and an enhanced emerging-market footprint in a much consolidated industry. But as the global
economy slows, Barclays still has plenty more bullets to dodge before that position can start to pay off.
-- Matthew Curtin
Overheard
At least it's over. Investors won't forget October 2008, which set bruising records across asset classes. "Safe
haven" gold had the biggest monthly percentage fall since 1980, while the black variety had its worst month
in exchange-traded history, slumping by a third. Once unstoppable copper did even worse, down 36%.
Stocks did better. But the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both had their worst Octobers
since 1987, falling 11% and 14 % respectively. At least there was a ray of light for those who kept their nerve:
The FTSE and Dow ended the grim period with their best weeks since 1984 and 1974 respectively.

China's Habit
On Savings
Offers a Lesson
The rainy day is here, but Americans haven't been saving.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday releases data on consumer spending and income in September.
Economists expect flat income and a decline in spending. That should boost the personal saving rate, the
percentage of disposable income left after spending, which was 1.3% in the third quarter, down from 2.7% in
the second quarter, when households socked away big portions of their one-time tax-rebate checks.
By comparison, the rate is more than 40% in China, which finances much of America's deficit spending.
U.S. savings have been shrinking for decades, briefly turning negative in the third quarter of 2005. All along,
one camp of economists has bemoaned how little consumers were socking away, while another said rising
home and stock prices made such worries foolish. That second camp has been awfully quiet lately.
The painful truth is that savings have to rise, either through a boom in incomes or slower spending.
Otherwise, consumers will just have to keep borrowing. That is hard to do these days, and ultimately
unhealthy in the best of circumstances.
"If we don't change our habits we will see more of these financial crises," said Sung Won Sohn, an economics
professor at California State University, Channel Islands.
As consumption drives 72% of the U.S. economy -- compared with less than 50% of China's -- consumer
deleveraging will result in sluggish economic growth, dragging on corporate profits and stock prices.
This doesn't have to mean the end of the world. The economy could stand to rely a little less on housing and
consumer splurging and a little more on exports and investment in new industries.
In other words, it could be a little more like China.
Is It Real Gold
Or Fool's Gold?
That is the question investors hope to answer when Goldcorp holds its third-quarter conference call Friday
morning. Analysts expect the metals maker to post profit of 15 cents a share for the quarter, 25% better than
last year.
But analysts already worry that fourth-quarter earnings are primed to sink some 32% because of a plunge in
gold prices since spring. Gold has fallen 27% since cresting above $1,000 in March.
But the long-term economic picture still is strong for gold bugs. America's economic growth was negative
during the third quarter, and interest rates are likely headed below 1%, meaning investors aren't losing much
opportunity by holding gold, which pays no interest. Global gold production has been stagnant for a decade,
while physical demand is so strong that it is hard to find gold bars and coins these days.
And if trillions in world-wide government liquidity injections ultimately do cause inflation, gold's price will
almost certainly rise, because inflation pushes hard-asset prices higher. That would boost 2009 earnings for
Goldcorp and its peers.

Unwinding by Hedge Funds, Others
Has Taken Shine Off Price of Gold
---
Asset of Last Resort Now Just Another Downtrodden Metal
The staggering unwind of leverage by hedge funds and other firms has resulted in sharp declines across a
number of sectors and asset classes. Commodities have been especially hard hit, and gold stocks in
particular have plunged since Sept. 1, performing much worse than the yellow metal itself.
Since Sept. 1, the price of gold has declined to $737.20 an ounce, down 11% from $829.30. But most gold
miners have lost at least 35% of their value in that time, and some are down by more than 50%. Barrick Gold
hit a 52-week high of $54.74 on March 14, but closed Thursday at $24.32 a share, a 56% drop. That is a
result of pullbacks by various types of funds, forced into selling positions because of redemptions and losses.
Some would argue that the declines in the miners are overdone. After all, gold has held up better than most
other commodities. The metal has fallen about 27% since hitting a high in March, while other commodities,
including oil, platinum and copper, are down more than 50%.
"The reality is that gold has been sold like every other asset class to cover debt or margin calls and to
preserve capital amidst a fearful and irrational market," wrote David Stein, analyst at Cormack Securities, in a
note. "As a matter of fact, gold has outperformed most other asset classes over the past few months."
Gold's traditional role has been as the asset class of last resort -- that is, the one to buy when everyone flees
other markets. But that has been modified as gold has become just another asset class, this one with appeal
to investors hungry to take advantage of gold-focused exchange-traded funds. Now, however, that's
reversing.
And the debate in coming months will be whether the economic environment sours to a point where gold
continues to be sluggish, or not. The efforts by the world's central banks to reinflate the economies would
seem to be a catalyst for demand, and potentially inflation, which augers for gains in gold.
However, economic demand has been slipping, and for the near-term, low global interest rates make the
idea that gold will be a hedge against inflation seem unlikely.
"It doesn't appear that there is much upside for [individual] demand until late next year," said Kevin Flynn of
Avalon Asset Management. "In addition, gold does best in inflationary environments (such as the 70s), and
while we may see a pickup sometime in 2010, for now we're living in a deflationary world."

Stocks Shed Gains in Late Swoon --- Dow Industrials Sail Along but Drop 74.16 After a Sharp Last-Minute Selloff
Wednesday's Markets
Stocks Shed Gains in Late Swoon --- Dow Industrials Sail Along but Drop 74.16 After a Sharp
Last-Minute Selloff

Stocks seemed poised for a second consecutive day of big gains after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates,
but dropped sharply just before the close and then recovered to end with modest declines.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 74.16 points, or 0.8%, at 8990.96. It was up more than 290
points and down nearly 175 points within the last 15 minutes of trading.
General Electric was a catalyst in the late-day swoon, finishing down 1.5%.
The late-day market selloff reflected a "sell the rallies" mentality in the stock market, said Todd Steinberg,
head of equities and derivatives for the Americas at BNP Paribas. After Tuesday's rally and gains Wednesday
afternoon, "stocks got back up to levels where people were comfortable selling," he said.
While the stock market slid, there were other signs that Monday marked a turning point.
Commercial-paper issuance has risen since a government program to lend to companies began, the yen has
fallen after soaring and commodities have rebounded following declines.
After Tuesday's 889-point gain, the Dow remains more than 800 points above its 5 1/2-year closing low
Monday. Still, traders and analysts wonder whether stocks are retesting their recent lows.
"It may be too early and too risky to be bold," said Ben Pace, chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank
Private Wealth Management in New York.
Many market participants worry the Fed's rate cuts may not do much good for months, at least. The market
response typically lags behind changes in monetary policy, and this time the wait could be longer as banks
remain nervous about lending and the global economy appears on the verge of a deep slowdown.
As expected, the Fed cut its benchmark rate to 1%, and also signaled that more cuts are a possibility. Some
banks lowered their prime rates in response.
Meanwhile, commodities rose. Oil jumped 7.6% to $67.50 a barrel, while gold rose 1.8% to $752.80 a troy
ounce.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index finished down 1.1%, or 10.42 points, at 930.09, with a 6.2% slide in its
financial sector.
Nonetheless, some investors have been gradually adding to their stock holdings. Neil Hennessy, president of
Hennessy Funds in Novato, Calif., said his firm has been looking for big-name stocks that are adequately
priced for the risks ahead.
The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index was a bright spot, rising 0.5%, or 7.74 points, to 1657.21.

IMF Creates $100 Billion Fund to Aid Crisis Fight
IMF Creates $100 Billion Fund to Aid Crisis Fight

The International Monetary Fund will offer as much as $100 billion in a new kind of loan to countries that are
battered by the financial crisis, making available new cash to help ease the world credit crisis.
The new three-month loans, aimed at economies the IMF judges to be troubled but basically sound, wouldn't
require countries to make the often severe changes in their policies that the IMF has demanded for decades.
That makes it potentially easier for crisis-hammered countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Korea to shore up
cash reserves, their currency, and their ability to help ailing companies as shaken foreign investors withdraw.
Those countries have shunned the IMF because of the strings attached to the loans, which often force sharp
budget cuts or interest-rate increases. The conditions are designed to help governments save money and pay
for necessary imports, but they also often deepen an economic downturn, making the IMF deeply unpopular
around the world.
Now it essentially is dividing developing countries into an A-list of nations that qualify for loans without strings,
and a B-list of everyone else.
Late Tuesday, the IMF unveiled a $25 billion package of loans organized for Hungary. That package and a
$16.5 billion loan for Ukraine require painful belt-tightening in exchange for help. Hungary must cut its budget
deficit further, plans to cut bonus payments to retirees and public-sector workers, and predicted on Tuesday
that the economy would shrink by as much as 1% next year.
The new program, which will use up to about half the IMF's resources, represents a big break from such
requirements. "Exceptional times call for an exceptional response," said IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn.
The Fed also took new steps to flood dollars into markets outside the U.S., where banks' unwillingness to
lend has left foreign firms without dollars they need. In recent weeks, the Fed has created arrangements with
central banks in Europe, Australia, Canada and other developed economies to make dollars available
overseas. On Wednesday, it extended those lines, for up to $30 billion each, to Brazil, Mexico, Korea and
Singapore.
The two moves underscore deepening problems in developing nations, which have sent currencies plunging
and blown holes in the balance sheets of healthy companies. In recent days, Brazil's financial capital of Sao
Paulo has been awash in speculation that the plunging currency and lack of dollar financing could spur a
wave of corporate defaults that might even bring down key parts of the financial system. After their stocks
plunged, major banks Banco Itau and Unibanco reported their earnings early this week in a bid to assure
investors that they are healthy.
Even healthy companies are finding it difficult to obtain dollar-denominated financing they need to do
business. In Brazil, the total stock outstanding of trade finance has dropped in half to $18 billion since the
crisis deepened.
Central banks in Mexico and Brazil deployed billions of dollars of international reserves in recent days to try to
fill the dollar void. The U.S. Fed move suggests the problem may have grown above their weight classes.
Even countries that don't take the money immediately could benefit if market confidence increases.
The IMF's new program, called the Short Term Liquidity Facility, would be used largely to pad a country's
reserves, which could help the recipient defend its currency. But the funds could also be used to help
recapitalize banks or cover import bills.

The IMF plan is its clearest recognition that its insistence on tough conditions is driving away potential
borrowers that might need its help. But the new plan also puts the IMF in the position of deciding who can
have money with few strings attached, and who can't.
"The more you send reassuring signals" by approving some countries for the loans with fewer strings, said
former IMF chief economist Simon Johnson, "the more you send warnings about others."
The IMF said it won't disclose the names of countries that it rejects for condition-free loans to try to make sure
its decision doesn't worsen the applicant's problems. But Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in a news conference that
Argentina wouldn't qualify because it hasn't had an IMF review of its finances for more than a year.
Argentina is also on the outs with many lenders because it defaulted on its loans in 2001 and offered only
partial repayment, which many borrowers considered inadequate.
Romania, Bulgaria and other Eastern European countries may also need IMF help, but haven't decided
whether to take the unpopular steps that would still be required for them by the IMF.
Belarus, which wants a $2 billion IMF loan, is indicating it would open its economy more to foreign investors
and loosen the state's tight control to get the money. Pakistan is likely to do the same, after weeks of
searching for alternatives to IMF funding. IMF and Pakistani officials say Pakistan is looking to get IMF
approval of a loan as early as next week, though it probably would require Pakistan to cut budget expenses
and popular subsidies for food and oil.
To qualify for loans under the no-strings program, countries must show that their public and external debt are
at sustainable levels and must have a "good track record" at the IMF, said a senior IMF official. "Borrowers
are expected to go on with strong policies," said Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
The program would offer three-month loans of as much as five times a country's so-called quota, meaning its
financial stake in the IMF. Mexico, for instance, has a quota of $4.75 billion, so it could borrow as much as
$23.6 billion. Borrowers can renew their loans twice during a year.
The IMF is funded by contributions from its members and its large holdings of gold, among other sources. By
itself, IMF money might be enough for the needs of Mexico or other countries. IMF funding also can often
unlock other lending. The World Bank, for instance, chipped in $1.3 billion for the Hungary package. The
World Bank has said it may double its lending to countries that might be affected by the financial crisis to $27
billion from $13.5 billion in 2007.
In many ways, the new plan is a reprise of a proposal by President Bill Clinton in late 1998 to have the IMF
lend to pre-approved countries. That was in response to criticism of the IMF by countries caught up in the
Asia financial crisis in 1997 and 1998 in which IMF pushed them to make deep economic changes. Tough
IMF requirements in Indonesia, for instance, played a role in violent riots that led to President Suharto's
resignation.
The IMF adopted a version of the Clinton plan in 1999, but no developing country asked for a loan before the
IMF killed the program in 2003. The countries worried that signing up would be interpreted by the market as a
sign of worry that the country would face turmoil later on.
This time, the IMF plans to streamline the approval process and keep the results quiet as a way to induce
countries to participate. Prospective borrowers are also far less picky now in looking for funding.
Mexico's Finance Ministry said it is keeping the door open to tapping the new fund. "Mexico approves any
moves by the IMF to actively generate new products that are attractive for its clients," said a ministry
spokesman. He said the country would have to evaluate the design of the new loan program "and the
convenience of taking it," before making a decision. Mexico now is rounding up $5 billion in alternative
financing from the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.
Korea, however, still may have little interest in the new arrangements. Koreans view the fact they needed IMF
help a decade ago as a national humiliation, and Korean officials have said other countries need such help
far more.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said the IMF is trying to learn the lessons from the Asia crisis and is limiting its demands for
change even for its traditional loans. IMF economists should pick policy changes necessary "to make a
program a success," he said, not to remake the economy.

Deutsche Asset Management sorts through the clutter of information to gain an edge

How do businesses sort through and make sense of all the information available both inside and outside of
their organizations? That's the challenge facing Sean Kelley, global CIO for Deutsche Asset Management, a
division of Deutsche Bank AG. When Mr. Kelley joined Deutsche Asset Management in 2005, the company
was trying to integrate the systems it inherited from several acquisitions. Now that work is done, and Mr.
Kelley is focused on using technology to help the business gain a competitive advantage.
He spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his plans. Here are edited excerpts of that conversation.
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: How is information technology strategically important for Deutsche Asset
Management?
MR. KELLEY: In finance there is a concept called "alpha," which means that you make returns beyond the
market as a whole. It's really what asset managers get paid for. For us technology is a sizable factor for
creating alpha.
Our portfolio-management business uses technology in a number of unique ways. For a portfolio manager to
really do his job, he needs internal research, external research and nontraditional research. If you can cast a
wide net and understand [the information you catch] quickly, then you can get to market much more quickly.
We are starting to look not only at traditional sources of information, but at next-generation places [for
answers] as well. We are using data-mining techniques to treat the Internet as a database.
WSJ: Does that mean, for instance, that you would monitor what's happening in an Internet chat room?
MR. KELLEY: Exactly. You might [also] take a standard Web site and [mine it for] information. Then you go
out into the blogosphere. There are about 100 million-plus blogs out there and that is doubling every six and a
half months.
There's a lot of information but also a lot of noise. You have to figure out algorithms to crawl through [all] this
automatically, taking out 95% of the noise and finding signals that indicate the emotions of the market. That's
the thing: The information doesn't have to be correct -- it just has to be dominant. A person doesn't have to be
right. It just has to be that everyone thinks that way. So if you can figure out ways to get to that information
and act on it before the market has a chance to correct itself, it gives you an added edge.
WSJ: Financial companies have a reputation for building more software than they buy. Can you just buy this
stuff or do you have to build it?
MR. KELLEY: We buy, beg, borrow and steal before we build. We have a lot of smart people, but we certainly
haven't cornered the market on brains. Leveraging what is out on the market is critical.
We start by looking outside, find tools and then augment them with our own internal tools. To mine the Web
you can use tools like Dapper or Yahoo Pipes, [free services that can capture targeted information from Web
sites], but then you [use] your own algorithms to sort through the data.
WSJ: Some of the technology you're describing is cutting-edge. Do you gravitate toward new technology in
general?
MR. KELLEY: We make it our business to understand next-generation technology. How, for example, do you
sift through the information on the Web and bring it back in a way that someone can work with? [Maybe we'll
use] graphical models and heat maps and geography maps and other visualization techniques. Rather than
be a chief information officer, I have to take that hat off and become a chief ideas officer and ask, "How can
we get an advantage with this?" And it makes the job that much more interesting.

--- Page 227 ---
Page 227 of 235 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
WSJ: Do you have a method to find ideas?
MR. KELLEY: It's just making it your business to stay cutting-edge by looking for ideas and using your
networks and personal relationships. I talk to fellow technologists in the industry but also out of the industry,
because I think some of the most important concepts for technology coming to market happen elsewhere.
Look at things like iTunes or Rhapsody or Flickr. The simplicity of the interaction is really key.
So the question is how can I take some of these consumer-app concepts and bring them in so that I can
make some of our business apps better. If you look at things like the iPod or the Mac itself, it is a very elegant
and engaging experience. So how do you take those concepts and bring them into the corporation?
WSJ: How important is making something that is easy to use when you are going for speed?
MR. KELLEY: The traditional CIO goes for resiliency, speed, stability and economic solution. But if you don't
finish the job and deliver a simplified experience, you shortchange all that work.
WSJ: How have you been affected by the events of the past few weeks?
MR. KELLEY: In turmoil markets it is really about understanding your exposure and providing resiliency. And
luckily we have been putting in a number of [systems] and processes that allow us to understand our
exposure.
With every turn of the newspaper someone is making a call down to our folks and saying, "I need a report on
this or that." We are handling many more ad hoc requests either from clients or traders or portfolio managers.
The projects haven't stopped, though. In the middle of the year we increased the number of projects we took
on. One of the things that we try to think about is that in times of turmoil there is really an opportunity. Not
only in providing a safe haven, but there's an opportunity to take market share.
There are always project priorities; there is something that is last. We have an investment governance
process which is pretty rigorous. Projects have to stand on their own either for return on investment or
because they are regulatory mandates. It is pretty much an analysis project-by-project, what does this
investment yield. During the more turbulent times, projects that have harder and shorter [return on
investment] tend to float to the top.
WSJ: Is outsourcing one way you can cut costs?
MR. KELLEY: At one point we had everything under our own roof. Now we can look to partners to take
certain pieces for us. Because (a) they do it cheaper, (b) they do it better or (c) they do both. We have
outsourcers who take a lot of work. Some of our maintenance is done by others, some of our support is done
by others. At the end of the day, our clients who get our services don't care if we did it or if one of our partners
did it. They need it to work.
Working with these groups takes a different management mind-set. The old mind-set was command and
control. I'd look out and there were all these people outside my office. In the network model, where the people
who are responsible for your projects don't necessarily have your business card, you have to adopt an
air-traffic-control mind-set.
WSJ: What other new technologies are you investing in?
MR. KELLEY: We have a product called Aurora that we built in conjunction with external partners that on a
single desktop has all forms of communications. It has chat, email, video, voice, calendar, e-rooms [Web sites
where people can share presentations and other documents] -- all on a single desktop. And it has presence,
which means that I can see whether someone is available, whether they are in a meeting, if they are out. And
if they are available I can pull them up on a video and solve my problem in two minutes.
WSJ: When you give people these new systems, do people use them or do they stick with what they know?
MR. KELLEY: People tend to want to solve their problems instantaneously. And instantaneous technologies
-- audio, video and chat -- facilitate that. Now if I want to have an interaction with three people I just click and
the three of them are on my screen. And we find that the communication among groups, it is really much
better. Our investors are forming communities. A researcher will come up with an idea and click on three
project managers and they'll say, "Hey this is a great idea," or "I was thinking the same thing." We find that
we become more of a real-time organization.
WSJ: You use a fair amount of online software. Why?
MR. KELLEY: We want to provide a framework so that users can build their own environments. Like an
iGoogle [a home page that people can configure to display different applications]. So we have a risk app and

--- Page 228 ---

a trading app and market data information and the collaboration apps and we say, "Piece together into your
own personal experience." We are a big believer in using [software from] outside our [company] as well as
what is in, and bringing that together in a meaningful way.
There is a lot of stuff out there, and if you can bring it in-house, that is a lot of code you don't have to write.

Financial Storm Hits Gulf --- Speculative Currency Trades Plunge Kuwait Into Bank Bailout
Financial Storm Hits Gulf --- Speculative Currency Trades Plunge Kuwait Into Bank Bailout

ABU DHABI -- The global financial storm rolled across the Persian Gulf on Sunday, as Kuwait's central bank
guaranteed bank deposits and cobbled together a hasty bailout for one of the country's largest banks.
The Kuwait intervention is the first bank rescue in the oil-rich Gulf, which until now had seemed relatively
immune to the current crisis. It came as local markets across the region continued their steep selloffs. With oil
prices down more than 50% from their July highs, the explosive, petroleum-fueled growth of the Gulf now
looks suddenly vulnerable at the same time as international and local investors are pulling back sharply.
Saudi Arabia, in an apparent bid to ease the fallout of the global credit crisis on its citizens, said it would
funnel some $2.3 billion in loans to low-income borrowers. And in Dubai, real-estate brokers in the Mideast
boomtown said they are seeing signs of price weakness for the first time in years, as financing dries up and
speculators bow out of the once red-hot market.
Property investors "are not finding buyers," says Tanya Vodenicharova, a property consultant at Dubai
real-estate broker 9 Properties. A significant property-market correction in Dubai could crimp government
finances, slowing or halting the debt-fueled expansion.
In Asia Monday morning, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.72% in early trading after Japan's finance
minister suggested the government is willing to counter the strengthening yen. South Korean stocks were up
about 0.39% after the central bank cut interest rates.
High oil prices have allowed state and private investors across the Gulf to funnel billions of dollars into
property markets, infrastructure projects and, more recently, foreign-exchange speculation. In particular,
many foreign and local investors earlier in the summer made speculative currency trades, betting that
regional governments would drop their currency pegs with the dollar to help tame rising domestic inflation.
International investors -- many of whom simply opened up local bank accounts in anticipation of a
strengthening of regional currencies if they abandoned their peg to the dollar -- rushed out of those trades
late in the summer and early last month when it was clear governments weren't going to act.
That left many banks strapped for cash, and scrambling for ways to make new loans. When international
borrowing seized up last month, the region found itself stuck in its own credit crunch.
But it was currency trades -- not bad loans -- that plunged Kuwait into a banking bailout on Sunday. Gulf Bank
said defaults by counterparties on bad euro-dollar derivatives contracts forced the bank to seek government
intervention.
The bailout further roiled Kuwait's stock market, which fell 3.5%, adding to losses that have pushed the
country's main market index down 19% this year. Other regional markets fell sharply as well.
Companies, banks and individuals have been burned by sharp moves in global currency markets as fears of
economic distress prompt an unwinding of trades that have depended on borrowed money. The dollar and
the yen have both soared against nearly every other global currency over the past month as investors
became convinced that a world-wide recession was looming. This has been particularly problematic because
investors have bet heavily on emerging-market currency positions.
For months, the Gulf appeared largely safe from some of the worst fallout from the housing, credit and
banking crisis that has rippled from the U.S. across Europe and Latin America and into parts of Asia. Awash
in oil revenue, Gulf officials assured investors their banking and financial systems were safe.
Several governments even took dramatic pre-emptive moves, funneling billions of dollars of cash into their
relatively small but liquidity-starved banking systems. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia promised $40 billion in

lending facilities to banks that needed cash. The United Arab Emirates pledged a sweeping three-year
guarantee on domestic bank accounts and promised to back up interbank lending.
None of the moves reassured the region's equity investors. In recent weeks, they have followed international
investors out of the Gulf's handful of stock markets, which earlier this year were some of the best-performing
among emerging markets. Sharp falls in the price of oil have also rattled confidence here.
While oil prices are still high enough to provide generous budget surpluses for most of the Gulf's
petroleum-dependent governments, the prospect of further falls has spooked investors.
Much of the Gulf has budgeted for much lower oil prices. Gulf states, on average, need prices above $47 a
barrel to keep from running budget deficits. But some states are more vulnerable than others: Bahrain's
so-called break-even price is $75 a barrel, compared with Saudi Arabia's $49 and Kuwait's $33, according to
the International Monetary Fund.
The speed of crude's tumble -- to about $64 a barrel -- has unnerved officials despite the apparent cushion.
At an emergency meeting on Friday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hastily decided to cut
output by 1.5 million barrels a day, the biggest single cut in almost eight years. After that move failed to curb
crude's fall on Friday, some oil officials suggested over the weekend that another cut was in order.
Weeks of sliding equity prices have wiped out billions of dollars of wealth for the region's influential clique of
local retail investors. Saudi Arabia's main stock-market index is down by more than 50% year to date. The fall
has wiped some $205 billion of value off the region's biggest exchange by market capitalization since June.
On Sunday, Kuwaiti traders, clad in white flowing robes and waving placards, staged their second
stock-exchange walkout in as many trading days. (Kuwait's market is closed on Fridays and Saturdays.)
Protesting before a government building in downtown Kuwait City, they demanded more state intervention in
the markets to prop up share prices. The chief executive of the National Bank of Kuwait, Ibrahim Dabdoub,
called on authorities Sunday to close the exchange altogether.
"If I were the man responsible for the stock market, I would order an immediate suspension of trading," Mr.
Dabdoub told the CNBC Arabiya satellite channel.
Gulf finance ministers met Saturday in the Saudi capital of Riyadh to discuss a unified response to the same
seize-up in local credit markets that has plagued the U.S. and Europe and now threatens government and
privately funded projects across the Gulf.
Kuwait and the rest of the region have a long history of government bailouts and generous subsidies for
citizens. It was unclear on Sunday whether the central bank would absorb Gulf Bank's losses to help it keep
operating, or work out a repayment schedule between it and its clients.
Gulf Bank, which has assets of $18 billion, and the government declined to disclose the size of the bank's
trading losses, but industry estimates in Kuwait were above $700 million. The government on Sunday
appointed a state supervisor for the bank's operations, suspended trading in the bank's stock and opened an
investigation.
Few analysts believed the government would allow the bank to fail. Kuwait and other Gulf states, with
massive oil savings, have plenty of financial firepower to throw at institutions if more problem trading
emerges.
"Given the overriding paternalism of the public sector, it seems unlikely that governments are yet ready to
tolerate high-profile bankruptcies or defaults," says Tristan Cooper, vice president for Moody's Investor
Services in Dubai.
Meanwhile, in Dubai, real-estate agents are seeing what could be the first signs that the city-state's property
boom is sputtering. There's no concrete evidence yet of significantly falling prices, and Dubai's property
developers have said they remain optimistic. But property investors, who were making big gains buying and
then reselling property just a few months ago, are lowering asking prices and increasingly willing to stomach
losses to free up cash, brokers said.
The sudden softening could be an early warning of deeper problems for Dubai, which has fueled its recent
supercharged growth through debt. Amid today's financial crisis, overseas borrowing and refinancing are
much more difficult, raising questions about Dubai's ability to pay back its loans.
Government and private corporations here have invested heavily in the property sector. Fitch Ratings
estimates that government-owned or partially government-owned developers control some 50% of new
property development due to hit the market in coming years. Meanwhile, banks, many of them partly
government-owned themselves, have been lending heavily to developers and investors.

--- Page 231 ---

If home prices here tumble, that would further strain revenue and finances for a handful of
government-controlled entities increasingly reliant on hard-to-come-by overseas borrowing. Unlike most other
governments in the Persian Gulf, Dubai -- one of seven semiautonomous emirates that make up the U.A.E. --
doesn't have much oil.
Government entities have borrowed some $47.6 billion in publicly reported debt, or 103% of gross domestic
product, according to Moody's. Dubai has a lifeline: Its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi, the biggest of the U.A.E.'s
emirates, has plenty of petrodollars in reserves. Dubai officials didn't respond to requests for comment.
Analysts have been forecasting a downturn in prices for months. Earlier this month, property consulting firm
Colliers International said Dubai property prices rose 16% in the second quarter. That was much slower than
the 42% price rise in the first quarter. Regional bank EFG-Hermes said last month that it expects prices to
peak next year and fall -- as much as a cumulative 20% -- by 2011.
Real-estate agents in Dubai said they're now seeing a clear slowdown. They say speculators, especially
those who were financing their property investment, have largely fled the market.
"There are a lot of people who need liquidity, and a few of them are ready to drop their prices," says Mara
Firetti, a consultant at AAA Group, a real-estate broker in Dubai.
Investors in new luxury villas at one Dubai development -- each priced at between $1.4 million and $2.2
million -- were reselling property at premiums of 10% to 15% of the original purchase price just six months
ago, Ms. Firetti says. Now, premiums have shrunk to zero in many cases. That means investors are willing to
sell at a loss, because they've already sunk in upfront fees.
Buyers looking for actual homes -- so-called end users, in industry speak -- are still shopping, brokers said.
But tighter credit requirements instituted recently by regulators and by banks have curtailed financing for
these would-be buyers, too.
HSBC Holdings PLC, the largest international bank offering home loans for Dubai property, tightened its
requirements last month, asking borrowers to put down as much as 50% of the purchase price for some
homes. The bank will now only lend up to 70% of the total value of the property in the best cases, down from
85% last month. The tougher terms are "to ensure that customers receive loans that they can afford to repay
at a time of considerable uncertainty around the world," the bank said in a statement to Zawya Dow Jones.
"Nobody wants to buy," says Lillian Gold, a property consultant at Blue Horizon Real Estate in Dubai.
"Everyone wants to sell."

The Age of Prosperity Is Over
The Age of Prosperity Is Over

About a year ago Stephen Moore, Peter Tanous and I set about writing a book about our vision for the future
entitled "The End of Prosperity." Little did we know then how appropriate its release would be earlier this
month.
Financial panics, if left alone, rarely cause much damage to the real economy, output, employment or
production. Asset values fall sharply and wipe out those who borrowed and lent too much, thereby
redistributing wealth from the foolish to the prudent. This process is the topic of Nassim Nicholas Taleb's book
"Fooled by Randomness."
When markets are free, asset values are supposed to go up and down, and competition opens up
opportunities for profits and losses. Profits and stock appreciation are not rights, but rewards for insight mixed
with a willingness to take risk. People who buy homes and the banks who give them mortgages are no
different, in principle, than investors in the stock market, commodity speculators or shop owners. Good
decisions should be rewarded and bad decisions should be punished. The market does just that with its
profits and losses.
No one likes to see people lose their homes when housing prices fall and they can't afford to pay their
mortgages; nor does any one of us enjoy watching banks go belly-up for making subprime loans without
enough equity. But the taxpayers had nothing to do with either side of the mortgage transaction. If the
house's value had appreciated, believe you me the overleveraged homeowner and the overly aggressive
bank would never have shared their gain with taxpayers. Housing price declines and their consequences are
signals to the market to stop building so many houses, pure and simple.
But here's the rub. Now enter the government and the prospects of a kinder and gentler economy. To
alleviate the obvious hardships to both homeowners and banks, the government commits to buy mortgages
and inject capital into banks, which on the face of it seems like a very nice thing to do. But unfortunately in
this world there is no tooth fairy. And the government doesn't create anything; it just redistributes. Whenever
the government bails someone out of trouble, they always put someone into trouble, plus of course a toll for
the troll. Every $100 billion in bailout requires at least $130 billion in taxes, where the $30 billion extra is the
cost of getting government involved.
If you don't believe me, just watch how Congress and Barney Frank run the banks. If you thought they did a
bad job running the post office, Amtrak, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the military, just wait till you see what
they'll do with Wall Street.
Some 14 months ago, the projected deficit for the 2008 fiscal year was about 0.6% of GDP. With the $170
billion stimulus package last March, the add-ons to housing and agriculture bills, and the slowdown in tax
receipts, the deficit for 2008 actually came in at 3.2% of GDP, with the 2009 deficit projected at 3.8% of GDP.
And this is just the beginning.
The net national debt in 2001 was at a 20-year low of about 35% of GDP, and today it stands at 50% of GDP.
But this 50% number makes no allowance for anything resulting from the over $5.2 trillion guarantee of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac assets, or the $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). Nor does
the 50% number include any of the asset swaps done by the Federal Reserve when they bailed out Bear
Stearns, AIG and others.
But the government isn't finished. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid --
and yes, even Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke -- are preparing for a new $300 billion stimulus package in the
next Congress. Each of these actions separately increases the tax burden on the economy and does nothing
to encourage economic growth. Giving more money to people when they fail and taking more money away
from people when they work doesn't increase work. And the stock market knows it.

--- Page 233 ---

The stock market is forward looking, reflecting the current value of future expected after-tax profits. An
improving economy carries with it the prospects of enhanced profitability as well as higher employment,
higher wages, more productivity and more output. Just look at the era beginning with President Reagan's tax
cuts, Paul Volcker's sound money, and all the other progrowth, supply-side policies.
Bill Clinton and Alan Greenspan added their efforts to strengthen what had begun under President Reagan.
President Clinton signed into law welfare reform, so people actually have to look for a job before being
eligible for welfare. He ended the "retirement test" for Social Security benefits (a huge tax cut for elderly
workers), pushed the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress against his union supporters
and many of his own party members, signed the largest capital gains tax cut ever (which exempted
owner-occupied homes from capital gains taxes), and finally reduced government spending as a share of
GDP by an amazing three percentage points (more than the next four best presidents combined). The stock
market loved Mr. Clinton as it had loved Reagan, and for good reasons.
The stock market is obviously no fan of second-term George W. Bush, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Ben
Bernanke, Barack Obama or John McCain, and again for good reasons.
These issues aren't Republican or Democrat, left or right, liberal or conservative. They are simply economics,
and wish as you might, bad economics will sink any economy no matter how much they believe this time
things are different. They aren't.
I was on the White House staff as George Shultz's economist in the Office of Management and Budget when
Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls, the dollar was taken off gold, import surcharges were
implemented, and other similar measures were enacted from a panicked decision made in August of 1971 at
Camp David.
I witnessed, like everyone else, the consequences of another panicked decision to cover up the Watergate
break-in. I saw up close and personal Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush succumb to panicked
decisions to raise taxes, as well as Jimmy Carter's emergency energy plan, which included wellhead price
controls, excess profits taxes on oil companies, and gasoline price controls at the pump.
The consequences of these actions were disastrous. Just look at the stock market from the post-Kennedy
high in early 1966 to the pre-Reagan low in August of 1982. The average annual real return for U.S. assets
compounded annually was -6% per year for 16 ?189 years. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a bear market.
And it is something that you may well experience again. Yikes!
Then we have this administration's panicked Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, and of course the
deer-in-the-headlights Mr. Bernanke in his bungling of monetary policy.
There are many more examples, but none hold a candle to what's happening right now. Twenty-five years
down the line, what this administration and Congress have done will be viewed in much the same light as
what Herbert Hoover did in the years 1929 through 1932. Whenever people make decisions when they are
panicked, the consequences are rarely pretty. We are now witnessing the end of prosperity.

Gold Is Bugging Its Biggest Fans --- Some Frustrated Investors Question Explanations Given for
Metal's Drops

Gold prices have fallen along with stocks lately, leaving many investors wondering why gold hasn't taken on
its usual role as a safe haven in times of turmoil.
Even after a 2.2% gain Friday, to $729.10 per troy ounce, gold futures were down 7.1% for the week and
16.6% so far this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 5.3% for the week and 22.8% in
October, while stocks around the world are plunging amid fears of a global recession.
Gold bugs, as committed gold investors are known, are frustrated and even angry.
There are many possible reasons for the slide in gold prices, including the suddenly firmer dollar, because
gold is priced in dollar terms. Some financial institutions are unwinding commodities bets as they reduce
leverage and shore up capital. India, a big consumer of gold, recently has shown signs of sluggish buying as
the rupee depreciated against the dollar, making gold more expensive for Indian jewelry makers.
"Gold will show its value once the dollar stabilizes," said Li Shanquan, portfolio manager of the $1.6 billion
Oppenheimer Gold &Special Minerals Fund.
But other market participants remain perplexed. "Every time gold is up or down, these same excuses are
frequently and repeatedly given," said Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of American Precious Metals
Advisors, adding that there must be something else going on.
In his newsletter of Oct. 16, Mr. Nichols suggested that central banks might have stepped up gold lending
recently, which would push down prices. In leasing transactions, bullion dealers borrow gold at a relatively
low interest rate, then sell it into the spot market and use the cash proceeds to invest in Treasury bills at a
higher rate. These gold sales might account for an additional source of supply, Mr. Nichols said.
Others, however, discount that theory, arguing that central banks are unwilling to lease their gold because of
counterparty-risk concerns.
There have been wild price swings in recent months. In the third quarter, the price for gold ranged from
$741.30 to $977.70 an ounce, more than twice the price range in the second quarter, and volatility is
continuing to rise this month. "How can something that has increased by 50% in volatility be a safe haven,"
asked Alan Plaugmann at Copenhagen-based Saxo Bank.
Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist with Merrill Lynch, said the recent implied volatility "shows the
market is much divided" about the outlook for gold, while market sentiment is tilting downward for most other
commodities. The World Gold Council said higher volatility should be "put in perspective" and gold remains
less volatile.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures retreated as the decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to trim
its output target by 1.5 million barrels a day failed to counteract concerns about shrinking demand. Light,
sweet crude oil for December delivery settled $3.69, or 5.4%, lower at $64.15 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. This is the lowest since May 31, 2007.
EXCHANGES: The Minneapolis Grain Exchange said Friday it plans to close its trading floor Dec. 19 and
move exclusively to electronic trading for its hard red spring wheat futures and options. It currently trades
wheat simultaneously on the floor and on the CME Group's Globex platform. After the floor is closed, the
MGE will continue to trade electronically on the CME Group's Globex platform.
