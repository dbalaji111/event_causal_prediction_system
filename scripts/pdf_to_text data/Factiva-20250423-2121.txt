Picks and Pans From Market Pros --- Decoupling Theory Gets Revisited; Banks, Health Care Look Nice to Some
Picks and Pans From Market Pros --- Decoupling Theory Gets Revisited; Banks, Health Care Look
Nice to Some

As the historic market collapse felled many investors, a handful set themselves apart by scoring big profits.
Now, several of these money managers expect more bad times ahead, including struggles for consumers,
limp earnings and a possible surge of inflation.
They also see pockets of opportunity.
George Soros is bullish on China, India and Brazil. John Paulson is investing in distressed debt, residential
mortgages, even companies in bankruptcy proceedings. Alan Fournier, a lesser-known investor with a strong
track record, likes some health-care shares, while James Melcher, also successful lately, likes corporate
bonds.
"We're trying to make hay while the sun's still shining," says Mr. Fournier, who runs $2.8 billion Pennant
Capital. "Maybe we can rally through the summer, perhaps for another year, but there are a lot of difficult
issues that we're going to have to deal with."
Mr. Soros is just as wary. The renowned 78-year-old investor and philanthropist calls the current terrain a
"trading market," saying in a recent interview that investors should take profits when shares surge, even if
they look promising long term.
"I'm not bearish but I don't see how we can have the kind of growth in profits that we had during the
superbubble," says Mr. Soros, who these days leaves most day-to-day trading decisions at his $24 billion
fund to Keith Anderson, a former BlackRock portfolio manager. The fund scored gains of 32% for 2007, 8% in
2008 and 17% so far in 2009. "He's the player, I'm the coach," Mr. Soros says.
Still, Mr. Soros remains on the lookout for investment ideas. Lately, he is identifying them in Brazil, India and
China, even though last year his exposure to emerging markets weighed on returns.
"Maybe we're making the same mistake again by thinking that China and India will decouple from the
developed world," Mr. Soros says. But "China is the major beneficiary of the collapse of the financial system.
For them it was an external shock," he says. "Because China is in a position to stimulate its economy, it will
be a motor for the global economy," partially replacing the U.S. consumer.
As for Brazil, Mr. Soros likes state-owned Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro SA, for example. But the firm
trimmed some of its position earlier this year in the company, known as Petrobras, which has seen a run-up
in the share price.
Mr. Paulson, who scored collective profits of more than $17 billion in 2007 and 2008 by betting against
subprime mortgages and financial shares, sat a huge pile of cash at the outset of 2009 -- some $19 billion of
his hedge funds' $30 billion, his investors say.
But as Mr. Paulson and his team spent weeks combing through the rubble of the credit markets, they
concluded that beaten-down prices assumed a rash of defaults that were unlikely to materialize.
"We completely shifted our focus on the credit markets from one which had a short bias starting in 2006 to
one that is aggressively long," Mr. Paulson said in a recent interview.
The posture has its risks, especially if credit woes spread among better borrowers. But over the past four
months, Mr. Paulson bought top-rated residential mortgage-backed bonds, commercial mortgage-backed
securities, distressed debt and leveraged loans. Mr. Paulson even purchased shares of some big banks and
financial companies, the kinds of companies he wagered against in 2008. As the market rebounded, Mr.
Paulson's funds scored gains of between 4% and 15% for the year, through the end of May, investors say.

Now, Mr. Paulson is buying shares of financial companies like Capital One Financial Corp. and J.P. Morgan
Chase &Co., as well as commercial real estate broker CB Richard Ellis Group Inc. and oil producer
Petro-Canada, according to public filings
"While we don't believe bank stocks in general are undervalued, we do believe many represent compelling
investment opportunities over the cycle," he says.
His team is buying selectively, as they fear lower growth ahead as consumers struggle. And Mr. Paulson is
concerned that all the money that the U.S. and other governments are shoveling at various problems
eventually will lead to a surge in inflation.
The stance is controversial -- others say it will be years before inflation becomes a problem. But Mr. Paulson
is buying protection now; more than 10% of his holdings are in gold, his investors say.
Like Mr. Paulson, Mr. Fournier was among the first investors to turn gloomy on housing. Mr. Fournier, who
once worked for prominent hedge-fund manager David Tepper, operates under the radar in suburban New
Jersey. His hedge fund, Pennant Capital, is up about 9% this year, thanks to gains from commercial and
residential mortgages.
Now he is bullish on an area that others are beginning to warm to: health care. Mr. Fournier argues that
WellPoint Inc., the big managed-care company, is a bargain. Though some are concerned that President
Obama's health-care plan would put a lid on earnings of WellPoint and other health-care firms, policy
changes "won't be as much of a threat to public HMOs as people fear," says Mr. Fournier, who regularly
consults with lobbyists working in the Capitol.
"WellPoint is a very cheap stock," he says, and can generate the cash flow to buy back as much as 40% of its
outstanding shares, he estimates. He likes the stock even though it has outpaced the market in recent
months.
Mr. Fournier also likes coal and utility stocks, such as Foundation Coal Holdings Inc. He recently succeeded
in helping to push out chief executive and chairman at mortgage and fleet-management company PHH Corp.,
where he sees big upside.
The danger: These companies get caught in a downdraft that Mr. Fournier is sure is down the line.
"I just don't know if the market can sustain itself past this brief window, when the stimulus impacts the
economy," Mr. Fournier says. "It's only a matter of time before stimulus effects fade, the economy rolls over,
deficits hurt bond yields and the dollar gets hurt."
Mr. Melcher's team at Balestra Capital is finding even fewer ripe investments. Balestra is relatively small --
just under $1 billion -- but the hedge fund has racked up stellar returns for several years, including gains of
199% in 2007, 46% last year, and 7% so far in 2009, according to investors.
It owns top-rated corporate bonds with yields of about 6.5%, investments that found popularity in recent
weeks.
But Mr. Melcher has become increasingly concerned that the stock market is beginning to look expensive
again, and that investors are overlooking problems.
"The economy is still deteriorating, job losses are still huge, I really don't see where earnings will come from
to drive valuations," Mr. Melcher says. "Just because things are getting worse at a slower pace doesn't mean
they're getting much better."
To profit from coming problems in rash of countries, Balestra has been loading up on derivatives, known as
credit-default swaps, that insure the debt of Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania, his investors say. The firm also
has taken positions against the debt of Sweden, Ireland and Greece. Behind the trade: It can cost less than
$5,000 annually to insure $1 million of this debt, making it a low-risk but potentially high-paying bet, the
Balestra team has argued.
Other investors who anticipated the housing problems, like Kyle Bass of $500 million Hayman Capital, are
betting big against the debt of Japan and the U.K., worried about rising debt obligations.
"These governments are all on the hook for bank debt and there's still very high leverage in those
economies," Mr. Melcher says. "The best outcome is we trudge along for a while."

Investing in Funds: A Quarterly Analysis --- A Taste for Risk Again --- Small investors, afraid of being
left behind in a big rally, are piling into mutual funds that invest in emerging markets, junk bonds and
volatile energy businesses

It's amazing the difference a rally can make in investors' appetite for risk.
A few months ago, mutual-fund investors were yanking money out of stocks and high-quality corporate-bond
funds and parking it in safer places, like money-market funds and U.S. Treasurys. Lately, however, as stock
and bond markets have rebounded, mutual-fund investors have had a split personality.
They're back to buying relatively safe investments like high-quality corporate bonds. But they're also pouring
money into the riskiest investments. They're lukewarm toward U.S. stocks but plunging into high-octane
vehicles like emerging-market companies, commodities and junk bonds -- making these among the 10
best-selling mutual-fund categories this year.
"Some have said, 'Well, if we're going back in [the market], let's take a real risk,' " says Iain Clark, chief
investment officer of Henderson Global Investors.
Some market watchers think these investors are trying to quickly recoup their massive losses from last year.
Or they believe these investors are simply chasing performance.
Whatever the motivation, though, they may be overdoing it.
The pros warn that some of these hot foreign and bond markets may be due for a breather, since they have
run up significantly in such a short time. What's more, experts advise investors against suddenly loading up
on any type of investment that would veer them away from their long-term asset allocations.
In the first five months of this year, investors poured a net $4.9 billion into diversified emerging-market mutual
funds, more than reversing the net $2.6 billion they pulled out in all of 2008, according to Morningstar Inc. In
comparison, mutual funds that invest in large U.S. stocks have had outflows of $11.2 billion, following a $52
billion outflow last year.
Meanwhile, natural-resources and precious-metals funds combined have had inflows of $7.8 billion so far this
year, versus an outflow of $2.1 billion last year. As for junk-bond funds, investors have put in $12.6 billion,
after adding $1.2 billion in 2008.
Many investors are also buying safer investments, like high-quality municipal-bond and corporate-bond funds.
Intermediate-term bond funds have had the highest inflows this year, of about $41.6 billion, according to
Morningstar.
But a growing group of investors are going to the other end of the risk spectrum.
Murray Schofield, a retired orthodontist in Arizona who sold most of his foreign investments in the second half
of 2008, has been buying emerging-market funds, and funds dedicated to China and India, since March. He
now has 23% of his portfolio in funds that invest in these stocks. "I have to recapture part of my losses," says
the 84-year-old. "Otherwise I'd be more conservative." His portfolio is up 20.4% for this year, following a 44%
loss in 2008, he says.
Here's a closer look at the outlook for three hot -- and potentially risky -- fund sectors.
EMERGING MARKETS
Stock markets of developing countries like India and Brazil have gone through the roof since early March,
reversing some of their declines from last year. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up about 34% for the

--- Page 9 ---
Page 9 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
first six months of the year, after losing 54.5% in 2008. Some niche markets have had wilder swings. Russia's
benchmark RTS index is up 56% for the year's first half, after losing 72.4% in 2008.
What's changed? Not only do investors have a greater appetite for risk these days, they're also more
optimistic about the economic outlook for some of these countries. In China, the world's third-largest
economy, the government's massive stimulus is starting to take effect. While exports are still down, internal
growth is gaining strength. Meanwhile, commodity prices have been on the rise, improving confidence in
Brazil and Russia.
Despite hot performance for emerging-market funds so far this year -- an average 33% return -- some money
managers say caution is in order. While they're optimistic that emerging-market economies will grow at a
much faster rate than the U.S. over the next several years, some worry about the recent explosive rally in
these markets.
"It's been the lower-quality, the riskier companies that have done better this year," says Simon Hallett,
co-portfolio manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets fund. "Emerging markets have probably
overshot in the short term."
Investors, these managers warn, should be prepared for a bumpy ride ahead. "There's going to be quite a bit
of volatility," says Andrew Foster, manager of the Matthews Asian Growth &Income fund.
Generally, financial advisers aren't ratcheting up their long-term allocation to developing countries, keeping it
typically between 4% to 10% of an average client's portfolio. If you do choose to plunge into emerging
markets, remember: You may not need a dedicated fund to have exposure to these markets if you already
own a broad international- or global-stock fund. Some of these funds buy into emerging markets; check a
listing of the most recent holdings to see where you stand.
COMMODITIES
The price of oil has been on a roller coaster since 2007, hitting an all-time high last summer and then losing
more than half its value over the next several months. Since February, however, it has reversed course, more
than doubling.
Some precious metals have been relatively less volatile. Gold lost around 25% in a four-month period last
year and has since regained that loss, coming back to where it was a year ago. Stocks of companies that
operate in the commodities space, like drillers and gold miners, have fallen and risen even more steeply than
the underlying commodities.
A couple of factors are behind these moves. Last year, as the global economy cooled, so did demand for
commodities, reducing the prices for oil and natural gas. And many large investment funds were forced to sell
their commodity holdings to meet investor redemptions, which further depressed prices.
Recently, investors have been piling into commodities, partly because they fear impending inflation, as the
U.S. government prints money to deal with the financial crisis. "Big swings in inflation all come from
commodity prices, so they're a good inflation hedge," says Mihir Worah, manager of the Pimco
CommodityRealReturn Strategy fund.
What's more, a number of people who were sitting on cash waiting for markets and the economy to improve
have rushed in lately. The upshot: The average naturalresources fund, which invests in stocks of
energy-related companies, is up 15% so far this year, after losing 49% in 2008. Precious-metals funds, which
buy stocks of companies in metals-related businesses, are up on average 19%, following a 30% decline last
year.
What do the pros think? Fred Fromm, co-manager of the Franklin Natural Resources fund, is bullish on
commodities over the long term but says challenges remain in the near term. There's more supply than
demand for oil, which typically leads to lower prices. Mr. Fromm says until there's confirmation that demand is
picking up or supply has slowed down significantly, the rally in prices might not be sustained in the near term.
Pimco's Mr. Worah says a dip in the market wouldn't surprise him, given the recent gains in commodity
prices.
Advisers typically use commodities as a diversifier for a small portion of their clients' portfolio. Richard
Schroeder, a financial planner in Amherst, N.Y., allocates 5% of his clients' portfolio to commodities, through
broad funds like Pimco CommodityRealReturn and Ivy Global Natural Resources.
JUNK BONDS

--- Page 10 ---

Bonds of companies that have low credit ratings have been on a tear lately, after a crushing 2008. Mutual
funds that invest in these bonds have gained on average 23%, making them the second-best-performing
bond-fund category, after bank-loan funds, which are up 26%.
Last year, junk-bond funds lost 26%, making them among the worst performers in bonds. Investors feared
that the financial system was on the verge of collapse, and companies wouldn't be able to repay debt. Lately,
investors have turned to these bonds in search of high returns and yields of 11% or more. To tap into this
appetite, fund companies have been launching offerings that invest in high-yield and distressed bonds.
But long-term fund investors should weigh the risks before buying. Given the weak economy, analysts expect
that an increasing number of companies will be filing for bankruptcy protection and defaulting on their debt.
And the amount of money that bondholders can recover from a defaulted company could be meager.
Consider the recent bankruptcies of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC; the Obama administration
pushed through restructurings that left bondholders with practically nothing.
Given all that, as well as the recent run-up in bond prices, money managers are approaching junk bonds with
caution. Dan Shackelford, manager of T. Rowe Price New Income fund, had been buying such bonds late last
year when they appeared to be cheap across the board. But he's more selective now. "At some point, we do
a gut check here and say, 'Have things fundamentally improved that much?'" he says. His view: "A lot of the
value has been squeezed out."
Some advisers believe that investors are better off buying the stocks of companies that issue these bonds,
since the bonds don't provide the safety that high-quality bonds and government bonds do. Others think there
is some diversification benefit to the bonds, and they like the high yields.
"There's a fair amount of risk there, but we're OK about taking that risk with a small portion of our portfolio,"
says Tom Orecchio, a financial adviser in Old Tappan, N.J. He allocates about 3% to 8% of his clients'
portfolios to such bonds, depending on their risk appetite.

Quarterly Markets Review: Commodities' Engine Hits Cruising Speed

Commodities rallied in the second quarter, powered by hopes for a global economic recovery and worries
about inflation.
Signs that economic declines were slowing emerged in developing economies and then spread to the U.S.,
sparking optimism about a quick recovery from recession and driving a strong rebound for commodities
across the board. Rising fuel and food prices, in turn, fed inflation concerns and spurred investors to buy
commodities as a hedge, making the commodities market one of the hottest of the year.
Oil prices rose 41% in three months, to $69.89 a barrel, the biggest quarterly percentage gain since 1990 and
more than double the early 2009 low of $33.98. Copper rose 23% in the quarter, putting it up 62% for the
year. The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index finished the second quarter with a 12% rise and now has
recouped all its losses since November.
Still, prices for many commodities remain about half what they were a year ago and uncertainty remains
about when the global recovery will begin and how strong it will be. The rally slowed near the end of the
quarter amid concerns prices had risen too much too fast.
The end-of-quarter weakening reflected "an increased degree of uncertainty" about economic recovery, said
Andrew Karsh, co-portfolio manager of Credit Suisse Total Commodity Return Strategy fund. In June,
economic readings remained mixed, demand for many commodities was weak and it wasn't certain that a
strong Chinese buying spree could be sustained.
The second-quarter surge was very much a China story. The World Bank in mid-June raised its growth
forecast for China in 2009 to 7.2%, up from 6.5% it forecast in March, citing "very expansionary fiscal and
monetary policies." China's favorable government policies and increased bank lending rippled through global
commodities markets.
Oil prices were buoyed by China's record auto sales, which surged 55% in May, according to the China
Passenger Car Association. In addition, the country stepped up efforts to hoard raw materials, leading to a
jump in imports of soybeans, crude oil and copper. In late-May, Goldman Sachs Group analysts made a
"China call" for increases in copper, zinc and soybean prices.
Other emerging economies lent support. Oil demand is poised to strengthen in India and Saudi Arabia this
year, said the International Energy Agency, despite a 3% decline in global consumption.
"Everybody wanted to get onto the recovery trade," said Edward Meir, a senior commodity analyst at MF
Global. In the first half, about $25 billion of net cash flowed into 1,500 commodities funds tracked by J.P.
Morgan Chase, surpassing all previous annual inflows, according to estimates by Jennie Byun, J.P. Morgan's
global commodities index strategist. Funds investing in precious metals, natural gas and agricultural
commodities had the biggest asset increases.
As cash poured in, commodities, which started moving up later than stocks, quickly caught up. In May, the
Dow Jones-UBS index registered the best monthly performance since calculations began in 1991, rising 13%.
Aggressive output cuts contributed to the moves.
Toward the end of the quarter, a strengthening dollar triggered a broad selloff in commodities, which trade in
dollar terms.
Bulls say commodities are still in a long-term up trend resulting from general inflationary pressure and
renewed economy activity down the road.
"We are talking here about a 'pause' rather than a change of direction," said Kevin Norrish, director of
commodities research at Barclays Capital. "Once there are consistent signs that the global economy outside

of China is really starting to pick up," including bottoming out in the auto and construction industries, "there is
likely to be further sustained growth in commodities."
The run-up early in the quarter caught many players off guard, forcing analysts to raise price targets even as
supply outpaced demand. J.P. Morgan Chase analysts lifted their forecast for the average price of oil in 2009
to $55.63 a barrel from $49.38, though "global demand and inventory levels look horrendous." They added in
a late-May report that "a second half economic recovery, perhaps more vigorous than even we foresee, is in
the cards." Goldman Sachs analysts raised their end-2009 oil-price target to $85 from $65, calling the rally
against rising inventories "unusual behavior."
The rally also stoked fears of inflation. Some food makers saw higher costs, as prices of soybeans and
sugar rose 29% and 33%, respectively. Drivers also felt pain at the pump, with U.S. gasoline prices soaring
32%.
The inflation concerns might be overblown. It often takes several months for prices to go through the supply
chain and commodities are more volatile than consumer prices. Hence, "your hedge will be more volatile than
your underlining risk," said Jeff Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a commodities research firm.
Gold, typically the ultimate hedge against inflation, didn't move as sharply as other commodities, perhaps
because it hadn't fallen as much from its 2008 highs. It gained 0.5% to $927.10 a troy ounce.

NEW YORK -- As the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked its fourth consecutive loss, member Boeing
remained a drag, while Oracle aided the technology sector and investors lost their taste for Supervalu.
The Dow industrials dropped 23.05 points, or 0.3%, to 8299.86. They now have fallen seven of the past eight
sessions for a loss of 499.40 points, or 5.7%. The blue-chip index was trading higher Wednesday until after
the Federal Reserve concluded its two-day meeting, at which it left interest rates unchanged as expected,
but chnaged some of its post-decision sentiment.
"The Fed's statement downgraded the risk of deflation and provided a modest upgrade in its assessment of
the economy," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist with RDM Financial Group. "But the Fed also
said that overall the economy remains weak."
Boeing continued its descent, dropping $2.55, or 5.8%, to $41.32 following a 6.5% decline Tuesday after
again delaying the first flight of its 787 Dreamliner. J.P. Morgan Chase said the setback will likely push down
Wall Street's per-share earnings views for 2009 and 2010.
Oracle (Nasdaq) rose 1.39, or 7%, to 21.26. Fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 7.2% as the stronger dollar and
continuing economic weakness weighed on revenue and earnings, but stronger-than-expected new license
sales and continuing cost management helped the software giant beat Wall Street expectations
Supervalu lost 1.88, or 12%, to 13.81, by far the S&P 500's biggest percentage decliner. The grocery-store
chain sees its fiscal first-quarter earnings per share "substantially below" analysts' expectations as it lowers
food prices.
Discover Financial Services rose 45 cents, or 4.9%, to 9.63. Fitch Ratings affirmed its issuer-default ratings
on the credit-card company and its main banking unit, but lowered the entities' individual ratings, saying core
operating earnings would remain under pressure until 2010.
Monsanto lost 3.14, or 4%, to 76.16. Fiscal third-quarter earnings fell 14% as cooler, wetter weather and
increased competition lowered revenue at the company's Roundup and related herbicide operations.
AutoZone fell 5.41, or 3.5%, to 148.80. Eddie Lampert-controlled ESL Partners disclosed that it sold outright
454,153 shares of auto-parts retailer's stock and distributed 2,578,742 shares to partners in one of its funds.
AES rose 95 cents, or 9.9%, to 10.58. Citing appealing share value and relatively secure earnings per share
growth, Barclays Capital upgraded the energy producer's stock to "overweight."
Freeport-McMoran Copper &Gold gained 1.62, or 3.4%, to 48.80. Rub some of the smudges off of the stock's
recent slide and there is some shine to the metals-mining company, said FBR Research in boosting shares to
"outperform."

Web Cable Not Ready for Prime Time
It is called playing defense.
There is no doubt the film and TV industries need to find a way to protect their copyrighted programming on
the Web. But the strategy unveiled on Wednesday by Time Warner and Comcast falls short of the ideal
solution.
The two companies will test an approach to offering cable shows online without charge but only for viewers
who have a video subscription. It is aimed at stopping anyone from turning off their TV subscription and
watching video via an Internet connection instead.
Trouble is, as a deterrent to cutting the video subscription, it lacks teeth. Plenty of video programming is
available online for free. Not only is there YouTube, but the broadcast networks such as ABC, NBC, Fox and
CBS offer many of their shows for free on the Web. There are even a few cable shows available. And
consumers also can buy individual episodes of many TV shows on services like Apple's iTunes.
Of course, cable channels have good reason not to throw all of their programs up online for nothing. Unlike
the broadcast networks, they get big fees from TV distributors such as cable operators and satellite-TV firms.
That has made cable channels hugely profitable and a source of steady growth for Time Warner, Viacom,
Walt Disney and News Corp., owner of The Wall Street Journal.
Not only would a free-for-all approach threaten those distribution fees, it would likely undercut advertising
revenue. There simply isn't enough ad revenue online to replace dollars lost from television, an issue
broadcasters also are wrestling with.
But the Time Warner-Comcast approach could backfire on the cable-network owners. One big reason the
sector now draws a majority of TV viewers is that its potential audience has increased. The number of
households subscribing to some form of pay-TV service rose to 85% last year from 58.6% in 1990, according
to SNL Kagan. That has helped boost cable channels' share of TV advertising.
Putting cable shows behind an Internet wall could start to reverse that trend. Admittedly, the number of
consumers switching off their video subscription in the short-term is likely to be tiny. But given the amount of
TV programming available and the steadily growing number of technologies making cheap online viewing
easier, it will increase.
At the very least, Time Warner and Comcast should offer an online-only option for consumers, so channels
won't automatically lose viewers among people cutting off their video subscriptions.
There is little the media companies can do to stop the havoc that the Internet is wreaking on their traditional
business. They can slow the drain of profits for a while. But eventually, the companies will have to come up
with new business models a little more adventurous than what was unveiled on Wednesday.

Kurds May Get Their Way With Sinopec
A maxim of the high-risk energy business is "you don't drill for oil in Switzerland." But you can buy oil
companies based there.
Addax Petroleum, with an office in Geneva but reserves spread among Nigeria, Gabon and Iraq, is selling
itself to China Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec, for $8.8 billion, including net debt.

--- Page 17 ---
Page 17 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Sinopec is paying about $16 a barrel of proven and probable reserves. The average for African and Middle
Eastern deals in 2008 -- a year with triple-digit crude prices -- was under $5 a barrel, according to consultants
IHS Herold and Harrison Lovegrove &Co.
Throw in Addax's possible reserves and contingent natural-gas reserves and the multiple drops to just over
$7 a barrel of oil equivalent. Your average buyer would never factor in such rosy assumptions. But then
Sinopec, 66%-owned by the Chinese government, isn't your average buyer. Besides slaking Beijing's thirst
for oil, Sinopec must be hoping to gain cachet by landing a large foreign transaction while other recent
attempts, such as Aluminum Corp. of China's deal with miner Rio Tinto, have failed.
One potential wrinkle is Baghdad, which still has no official agreement with Kurdish authorities on managing
the region's oil. The Iraqi government might take offense at Sinopec's move and block access to bigger
projects elsewhere in the country.
Then again, would cash-strapped Baghdad really confront a major oil consumer ready to pay top dollar for
reserves? Even if it did, Addax's Kurdish assets represent just a fifth of its proven and probable reserves. For
the sake of expediency, Sinopec could potentially split them off to appease Baghdad and still gain Africa's
riches.

Dreamliner's Asian Angst
Is the latest delay in Boeing's 787 Dreamliner good news for Asia's airlines? With most strapped for cash,
capital-expenditure savings and possible compensation for the delay are both welcome. Also, given a slump
in air traffic, fleet expansion hardly is urgent.
But the fifth delay to the jet's delivery brings complications. Immediate hopes to cut fuel costs substantially
are out the window. All Nippon Airways, among the first set to receive the new aircraft, said in April that fuel
savings and higher capacity in the 787 would add up to $100 million of profit in fiscal 2011. Qantas, Boeing's
biggest airline customer for the 787, has long touted the Dreamliner's potential to cut fuel expenses by 20%.
The delivery delay worsens already difficult planning -- of routes, budgets and strategy -- for the Asian
carriers, the largest buyers of the new planes. ANA says 787 uncertainty, and the global downturn, make it
difficult to revise its midterm business plan. Qantas, meanwhile, plans to use the first 15 787s to expand its
Asian budget airline, Jetstar. What is worse for these airlines is that there isn't a viable alternative to the
Dreamliner. The Airbus A350, often presented alongside the Dreamliner, will fly in 2013 at the earliest. The
787's predecessor, the 767, guzzles more fuel.
For the planners at Asia's airlines, the Dreamliner has brought sleepless nights.

Europe's Quiet
Aggression
Could Pay Off
When is quantitative easing not quantitative easing? When it is a European Central Bank liquidity operation.
On Wednesday, a record 442 billion euros ($622 billion) of one-year funds was pumped into the European
banking system, answering critics who say the ECB isn't doing enough to fight the crisis.
True, the ECB isn't increasing the quantity of money in circulation in the same way as the Federal Reserve
and Bank of England, which are buying assets outright. But providing unlimited liquidity to banks is designed
to achieve a similar goal. Since the crisis began, the ECB has expanded its balance sheet as aggressively as
the Fed or the BOE.
But ECB has arguably been smarter. It has provided the banking system with unlimited liquidity against an
ever-expanding range of collateral at ever-wider maturities, culminating in the latest one-year operation. It
hopes this funding will both encourage banks to redeploy the cash in other assets, driving down yields, and to
resume lending.
The Fed and BOE want to drive down yields and boost lending. But they have used some of their firepower to
bypass banks and buy assets outright, with the aim of reopening credit markets. This different approach
partly reflects the relative importance of the banking system in Europe and difficulties the ECB would face
buying government bonds.

--- Page 18 ---

The advantage of the ECB's approach: It doesn't require an elaborate exit strategy. As the three-month,
six-month and one-year liquidities mature, the ECB's balance sheet will automatically shrink. In contrast, the
Fed and BOE are struggling to explain how they will mop up the excess liquidity they have provided, causing
uncertainty and fueling fears of inflation.

Overheard
At a dinner for the who's who of the insurance world on Tuesday evening in Manhattan, Lord Levene,
chairman of Lloyd's, presented the "Lloyd's Medal for Saving Life" to Capt. Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger. The
pilot, who landed a US Airways flight safely in the Hudson River in January, was seated with the likes of
Maurice Greenberg, formerly of American International Group, and Ajit Jain of Berkshire Hathaway.
The medal recognizes acts of courage in saving lives, and a gold version has been awarded only once
before, in 1921. In this instance, insurers might be thankful that his skill also spared the industry from possible
big payouts.
Lord Levene in his remarks noted that Capt. Sullenberger says he simply did what he was trained to do. Said
Lord Levene: "If only the banking industry had been following that philosophy over the last few years."

Ben Bernanke vs. The Journal on Inflation --- Speed Demons At the Fed
Ben Bernanke vs. The Journal on Inflation --- Speed Demons At the Fed

23 June 2009

Copyright 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Editor's note: The following editorial ran on Dec. 9, 2003, under the headline "Speed Demons at the Fed."
The editorial was criticized the same day in remarks by Ben Bernanke, who was then a Federal Reserve
Governor, at a meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. Mr. Bernanke's comments, which were recently
released by the Fed, and a related editorial appear nearby.
If Federal Reserve Board members were Nascar drivers, their motto might be, "Look, Ma, no hands." The
economy has begun to speed along, and some key price signals are raising the yellow flag, but the Federal
Open Market Committee, which meets today, refuses to put its hands on the steering wheel, much less its
foot on the monetary brake.
The governors have leaked that they aren't likely to tighten what may be the most accommodative monetary
policy since Arthur Burns roamed Fed hallways in the 1970s. The fed-funds rate will apparently remain at
1% "for a considerable period," as the Fed language of recent months puts it. Certainly no one can accuse
Chairman Alan Greenspan of stealing the economic punch bowl.
The concern we and others have is precisely the opposite -- whether the Fed is paying adequate attention to
those yellow-flashing price signals. Gold closed above $406 yesterday and commodity prices in general are
up nearly 30% this year. The dollar is weak across the board and continues to hit new lows against the euro
almost daily. Dollar weakness in turn induced OPEC last week to float the prospect of raising the price of oil,
which trades in dollars and is already around $31 a barrel.
OPEC's chatter gave those of us who remember the 1970s a jolt, because the cartel first came to global
prominence after Richard Nixon broke free from the Bretton Woods monetary system and the world
embarked on its last great inflation. Rising oil prices then were a result of dollar inflation, not its cause.
We're willing to stipulate that Mr. Greenspan wants no return to the 1970s. After Paul Volcker, no one has
done more over the years to reduce inflation expectations to their recent low ebb than the current Fed
Chairman. Core inflation also remains low, though it has climbed about one percentage point this year and
the consumer-price index is always a lagging indicator.
We get worried, however, when Fed Governors begin to say that their days of fighting inflation are over. Fed
Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson has been declaring the monetary equivalent of "mission accomplished"
wherever he goes, most recently in a November 21 Chicago speech. "Inflation still seems more likely to
move lower than to increase," Mr. Ferguson averred, making us wonder what prices he has been watching.
Perhaps none. Mr. Ferguson and Fed Governor Ben Bernanke seem preoccupied instead with productivity
growth and what they call "the output gap." The former has been growing rapidly -- if you believe we really
know how to measure such things -- and the Fed argument is that rapidly rising productivity allows for easier
monetary policy for a longer period. If these productivity gains continue once companies begin to hire more
workers, then perhaps this will be a correct judgment. But that's a long way from certain.
As for the "output gap," this refers to the difference between actual GDP growth and the level of "potential
output." Well, third-quarter growth of 8.2% isn't chopped liver, and most every forecaster now expects 4% in
the current quarter extending into next year. Fiscal policy in the form of the Bush tax cuts is also helping to
spur growth, and will continue to do so next year, contrary to Democratic-Keynesian predictions that it would
be a one-time boost last summer.
In any event, the Fed's main obligation is maintaining stable prices. That means paying attention to what
have historically been the best indicators of future inflation -- such as a rising price of gold and commodities,
and a falling dollar. The greenback warrants special Fed attention because the world clearly believes that the
Bush Treasury (its protestations aside) prefers a cheaper currency.
Traders are betting on that prospect every day, and the danger is that a falling dollar becomes a rapid
self-fulfilling prophecy. A run on the dollar could require the Fed to lift rates abruptly and stop the current

recovery in its tracks. Short of a crisis, a resurgence of inflation even to 3% or 4% could lead to higher
interest rates next year and beyond and slow growth into 2005 and 2006.
A sign from the Fed today that it is mindful once again of inflationary risks would reassure investors that the
speed demons at least have their hands on the wheel.

Activity monitors using accelerometers can aid in weight control by estimating the calories you expend during
the day, according to companies that sell them. Scientists say that the gadgets can be good motivators, but
that you shouldn't count on them for an accurate estimate of daily calorie burn.
---
Accelerometers, worn around the waist, arm or thigh, measure the motion of the body and also are used in a
number of electronic devices. A growing number of companies are selling advanced devices that track the
number of calories you're burning and can be worn all day -- even while you sleep. Some devices are similar
to those used by researchers to detect calories burned in patients in clinical trials. Prices vary, typically from
about $50 to $200 or more. In some cases you can subscribe to a Web site to download activity information
and compare it with your food intake.
One heavily studied device is an armband made by Pittsburgh-based BodyMedia Inc. The device, worn by
contestants on NBC's "The Biggest Loser" reality show, is sold as GoWear fit by BodyMedia and as the
bodybugg by health-club company 24 Hour Fitness Inc.'s Apex Fitness Group unit. The armband detects not
just motion but also skin temperature, heat flux, or the amount of heat leaving the body, and galvanic skin
response -- a measure of electrical conductivity that changes when you sweat. The information is fed into
mathematical equations programmed into the device and aimed at estimating your total daily calorie burn.
Apex claims on the bodybugg packaging that the armband is "proven to be over 90% accurate in measuring
calories burned." The company cites a 20-person study published last year in the online edition of the British
Journal of Sports Medicine. In the study, a similar armband called SenseWear, made by BodyMedia for
physicians and academic researchers, was used to estimate calories during two hours of activity. The
armband underestimated calorie burn by 9% when compared with a laboratory gold standard called indirect
calorimetry, in which oxygen consumption is used to measure calorie burn. In another study, done over 10
days, the armband underestimated daily energy expenditure by an average of 117 calories, or 5%. The study,
published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2007, used another sophisticated lab test for
comparison.
Other monitors, such as a line made by ActiGraph LLC of Pensacola, Fla., also tout good group data, but
scientists warn that results may vary greatly according to the individual. "You can get a pretty good group
[average] measure, but on an individual basis you may be off by 20% to 30% or more," says Patty Freedson,
chairman of the kinesiology department at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. The rate of error is
likely to be consistent for a given person, so the devices "will be accurate in showing improvement" in
physical activity levels, she adds.
BodyMedia says unpublished data, some of which the company sponsored, show that 75% of armband users
will have an error of 10% or less using the armband, and 95% will have an error of 20% or less.
Even if these devices can't perfectly estimate calorie burn, they can be good motivators, scientists say. A
three-month study of 57 dieters, published in the journal Obesity in 2007, found subjects who used the
armband along with diet and exercising counseling lost 13.6 pounds, compared with only nine pounds for a
control group who received only the counseling. The study's size was too small to achieve statistical
significance -- meaning that the positive result could be from chance alone. But study co-author John M.
Jakicic, says response to the device by study participants was positive, and he believes larger studies, now
continuing, will show a benefit. Dr. Jakicic, director of the Physical Activity and Weight Management
Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, also serves as a paid consultant to BodyMedia.

Oil Falls Below $67 a Barrel as Demand Concerns Take Hold --- Recent Rally Falters as Investors Lose
Faith in the Prospect for a Significant Summer Rebound in Gasoline Use

NEW YORK -- The price of crude oil fell below $67 a barrel for the first time in three weeks in a selloff fueled
by questions about the strength of U.S. gasoline demand.
The price of the light, sweet crude-oil futures contract for July delivery fell $2.62, or 3.8%, to $66.93 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The July contract expired Monday, and August becomes the
front-month for Tuesday's trade date.
Investors are rapidly losing faith in the prospect for a significant rebound in summer U.S. gasoline demand.
Last week's official U.S. petroleum data showed a sharp increase in inventories of the motor fuel. That report
snapped a rally that had carried both gasoline futures and pump prices to eight-month highs.
The benchmark Nymex gasoline futures contract has slid 11% since Wednesday. Monday, reformulated
gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, for July delivery fell 6.47 cents, or 3.4%, to $1.8597 a gallon.
U.S. gasoline demand accounts for more than a 10th of global oil consumption. Oil's run-up from the
February lows came partly on the back of expectations that demand from countries such as China would
remain robust as the economic downturn recedes. However, even small changes in U.S. fuel-use patterns
can have an marked effect on world oil flows.
In the world's largest oil consumer, gasoline demand usually peaks in the summer. But the recession has
curbed vacation plans, and rising unemployment is cutting the number of commuters. With retail prices hitting
an average $2.69 a gallon nationwide Monday for a gallon of regular gasoline, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration, the price at the pump alone no longer is low enough to spur demand.
Changes in pump prices usually lag behind trends in the futures market by several weeks, so the latest slump
in gasoline futures, if it persists, probably won't offer relief to drivers until after the Fourth of July weekend.
"The market is not as tight as some participants might have thought," said Antoine Halff, an analyst at
Newedge Group.
Gasoline inventories are below average for late June. Refiners have held off on ramping up production as
they wait to see if consumption will pick up over the course of the summer.
Since refiners are operating at only 85.9% of capacity, low for this time of year, gasoline supplies are unlikely
to tighten further because of ample spare capacity, even with a sharp increase in demand, said Tim Evans,
an analyst with Citi Futures Perspective. "We are ignoring that refineries are restraining production," Mr.
Evans said.
Analysts expect U.S. gasoline inventories to keep rising, forecasting a 1.6 million-barrel increase in data to be
released Wednesday. Oil stockpiles are expected to have fallen by 1.4 million barrels, while distillate
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, are expected to increase by 800,000 barrels.
A rebounding dollar also has put pressure on crude, as investors move away from riskier assets, such as oil,
and into stabler markets. Equities have fallen as well, in anticipation of Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve
meeting, at which the central bank's open market committee is expected to give its latest economic outlook.
Commodities in general declined Monday. Metals were particularly hard hit, with most-active August gold on
the Comex division of Nymex dropping $15.20 to $921. Nearby June fell $15, or 1.6%, to $920.60 a troy
ounce. Cotton fell 1.05 cents on the ICE Futures U.S. Exchange to 50.51 cents a pound.
In other commodity markets:

COPPER: Prices on the Comex fell in large part because of heavy selling by speculative funds. Analysts
described the 5.3% decline as a "correction" driven by U.S. dollar strength and faltering stock markets.
Nearby June copper dropped 11.85 cents to $2.1270 a pound.
CORN: Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade tumbled because weather in major U.S. corn-producing states
was deemed favorable to crop development. While the weather was the primary market driver, traders said
that declines in crude oil and the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar also contributed to the negative tone in prices.
Nearby July corn fell 14 cents to $3.8525 a bushel.

Diesel prices are rising again after having fallen below those of gasoline in recent weeks, piling more financial
pressure on recession-stricken manufacturers and truckers.
Prices for crude oil and the gamut of petroleum products have been rising, in part because traders expect an
economic recovery to boost demand and in part because fuels look like a good hedge against widely
expected monetary inflation and a weak dollar.
Oil prices rose 0.8% Wednesday to $71.03 a barrel as new federal data showed demand for gasoline rising.
Gasoline prices have risen for seven weeks in a row, further squeezing cash-strapped consumers.
Long-haul truckers and others who use diesel are benefiting from a slight price advantage over gasoline,
largely because diesel demand is at a nine-year low. U.S. consumption of diesel and similar fuels plunged
17% last week from the same period last year, weekly government data show. Supplies are at a historic high.
Retail diesel prices have climbed more than 14% over the past month to a national average of $2.61 a gallon,
according to the auto club AAA. That still trails gasoline prices, which jumped 16% in the same period to an
average $2.68 for a gallon of regular unleaded.
In many parts of the world, diesel is used to fuel manufacturing plants and the trucks that transport their
products. Its prices are mostly tied to the fate of the global economy, currently in a severe downturn. In the
U.S., the number of tons hauled by trucking companies dropped 13% in April from the same month last year
to its lowest level since November 2001, according to an index compiled by the American Trucking
Associations, an industry trade group.
If the economy strengthens, fuel prices will likely continue to climb in coming months, analysts say, potentially
stalling out a budding recovery. That is what Freeport, Ohio, truck driver Lewie Pugh fears. Mr. Pugh said
activity at many of his usual delivery spots -- chemical plants and paper and steel mills -- is at a virtual
standstill. His business is half what it was last year.
"I don't see anything picking up, and fuel prices are just going to make it worse," said Mr. Pugh as he drove a
load of water-treatment chemicals to an oil refinery near Philadelphia.
One consolation for truckers is that diesel prices remain considerably lower than last year. Diesel hit an
all-time high of $4.85 a gallon last July as refiners struggled to keep up with brisk global demand for the fuel.
Gasoline prices topped out at $4.11 a gallon the same month.
In China, diesel consumption grew slightly in April compared with a double-digit drop at the end of 2008, said
Paul Ting, whose research firm Paul Ting Energy Vision LLC specializes in tracking Chinese energy
consumption.
But even if rapid demand growth in developing countries resumes, analysts say it is unlikely diesel prices will
shoot up to last year's levels because refiners have added capacity to produce larger amounts of the fuel
since then.

Crude Oil Claws Back to $71.03
Commodities Report
Crude Oil Claws Back to $71.03

Crude-oil futures ended higher after dipping to a one-week low, as the latest U.S. petroleum data showed
rising demand but also an abundance of supplies.
Light, sweet crude for July delivery settled 56 cents higher, or 0.8%, at $71.03 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, snapping a three-day losing streak.
Crude futures rebounded from an intraday low of $69 a barrel when U.S. stocks temporarily hit positive
territory. Market participants reassessed the Energy Department's weekly petroleum report, which was initially
viewed as mixed. While crude-oil inventories dropped by a bigger-than-expected 3.9 million barrels last week,
a rise in gasoline stockpiles exceeded forecasts.
"The crude-oil market has finally got into a significant process of tightening," said Costanza Jacazio, an oil
analyst at Barclays Capital in New York. She noted that oil inventories have fallen about 30% from their April
peak of 91.3 million barrels.
It is on this tightening that oil prices have more than doubled from their February lows, sparking worries that
surging fuel prices could undermine a nascent economic recovery in much the same way last year's record
prices exacerbated the downturn.
Lower prices have spurred gasoline demand, which last week was 1.1% higher than the same period in 2008.
But that increase in demand encouraged imports, which, while often volatile, rose 25% on the week. Still, total
U.S. oil demand is down 6%.
The draw in crude stockpiles and the rise in gasoline inventories "offset each other, and the effect on the
market was neutral," said Morgan Downey, a commodities trader at Standard Chartered in New York.
The market also was driven by expiration of options to buy or sell crude futures for July delivery.
"The market had a tendency to gravitate around the nearest strike price, in our case $70 a barrel," said Peter
Donovan, vice president at Vantage Trading.
Crude's rally over past few months was supported by a weaker dollar, as inflation fears drove investors to
buy commodities as a hedge. However, signs of inflation aren't yet evident, as data showed Wednesday that
U.S. consumer prices fell 1.3% in May, the largest 12-month decline since April 1950.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures rose on bargain hunting as crude oil recovered from early weakness and the dollar index
eased slightly. Some traders may use a recent pullback in gold as a buying opportunity on ideas the dollar's
medium- to long-term direction still may be lower, despite the recent bounce, said Joel Crane, metals
strategist with Deutsche Bank. Nearby June gold gained $3.80, or 0.4%, to $935.40 a troy ounce on the
Comex division of the Nymex, while most-active August rose $3.80 to $936.
COFFEE: Speculative liquidation pushed ICE Futures U.S. arabica coffee futures to their lowest levels in
nearly seven weeks as traders bailed out of inflation hedges. Nearby July coffee settled 3.95 cents lower to
$1.1845 a pound.

Black Swan Trader Bets Reputation On Inflation
Black Swan Trader Bets Reputation On Inflation

Mark Spitznagel made a fortune predicting the "black swan" that hit markets last year. Now the relatively
unknown hedge-fund manager is emerging from the shadow of his collaborator, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, with
a big bet inflation will soar.
The 38-year old Mr. Spitznagel managed the Black Swan funds to triple digit returns last year with a bet on
volatility. The returns have brought a flood of cash, sending assets for his firm, Universa Investments LP,
rising to $6 billion from $300 million.
But, for all the gains, Mr. Spitznagel is still far less known than "Black Swan" author Mr. Taleb, who invests in
the funds and helps shape their strategies but doesn't manage the money.
"Black swan" alludes to the once-widespread belief that all swans are white -- proved false when European
explorers found black swans in Australia. A black-swan event is something extreme and highly unexpected.
Mr. Spitznagel's winning streak now will be tested. Universa is poised to make a huge wager that will reap big
rewards if inflation surges. Inflation is on investors' radar thanks to extensive economic stimulus efforts.
"The consequences of the monetary bender the government has put on could be huge," Mr. Spitznagel says.
The new fund, expected to start trading in July, will place bets on options tied to assets expected to benefit
from a big leap in prices, including commodities such as corn and crude oil, and options on shares of oil
drillers and gold miners. It also will short Treasury bonds, likely to weaken in an inflationary economy.
The inflation bet marks a change for Universa. Typically, Messrs. Spitznagel and Taleb don't have an
opinion about the near-term direction of the markets or economy. Rather, they argue, investors tend to
underestimate the risks of major market swings. The latest wager is more of a directional bet that regulators'
efforts to prop up the financial sector and the broader economy will spark inflation.
Mr. Spitznagel's approach to trading dates to his time as a fledgling pit trader in the early 1990s at the
Chicago Board of Trade, where he bought and sold commodities such as cotton and soybeans.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Spitznagel moved to New York to take courses at New York University, where Mr.
Taleb taught. Mr. Taleb was planning to launch a hedge fund in which he would buy far out-of-the-money
"put" options that would pay off if the market plunged sharply. Usually it didn't, and the options expired
worthless, generating small losses. Options give their owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a
stock at a certain price.
"One thing Mark taught me was that when someone isn't afraid of losing small amounts, they're almost
invincible" because they have more staying power, Mr. Taleb said.
The strategy often either looses money or posts flat returns, which can turn off investors. Though the fund Mr.
Taleb launched, Empirica Capital, initially made some money, when volatility fell its returns did, too. Burned
out by the day-to-day trading grind, Mr. Taleb in 2004 closed down Empirica and concentrated on writing.
Mr. Spitznagel, meanwhile, joined a Morgan Stanley trading unit called Process Driven Trading. Not inclined
to meet the bank's request that he sign a stringent "noncompete" agreement, he left Morgan in early 2007
and started to lay the groundwork for Universa.
Universa started trading out of a small office in Santa Monica, Calif., a location Mr. Spitznagel selected partly
because of its distance from Wall Street. Mr. Spitznagel doesn't read financial news; rather, he developed
software programs that troll options markets for deals.

--- Page 30 ---
Page 30 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
A small group of mathematically trained traders track the programs, frequently discussing which trades to
make with Mr. Spitznagel. Only 14 people work at the firm, though more will be hired for the inflation funds.
Mr. Spitznagel's strategy gained an advantage last year as the turmoil in subprime mortgages turned into a
rout. In late September, he was meeting a client outside Chicago while keeping track of the market on his
BlackBerry. Investors were on edge as Congress voted on the Treasury Department's $700 billion
financial-rescue package.
Suddenly, the market plunged after the House voted it down. Mr. Spitznagel rushed back to his hotel to field
calls from investors and manage the fund's positions from a laptop along with traders at Universa's
headquarters.
During the next few months, Universa's positions surged in value. Investors piled in, eager for protection as
the market spiraled lower. In early 2009, Mr. Spitznagel closed the strategy to new investors.
Now, Universa faces the risk that a quick market recovery eases investors' concerns about another crash. Mr.
Spitznagel says that would be a mistake.
"People have been very quick to think that the low is in," he said. "They've lost all perspective on what a bear
market can look like and how long it can last."

Dow Falls 187.13 in Return to Loss for '09 --- Recent Gainers Led Decliners, With Alcoa Off 6.5%;
NYSE Volume of 4.6 Billion Is Below Average

Stocks had their biggest drop in a month as the dollar rose and commodities prices fell, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average back into negative territory for the year to date.
The Dow fell 187.13 points, or 2.1%, to 8612.13. That left the industrials down 1.9% for 2009 after turning
positive for the year on Friday. The Dow ended Friday up 34% from its March 9 low.
Despite the day's drop, traders said the session was quiet. The decline was led by sectors that have led
recent gains, such as industrials, energy and other commodities. Alcoa fell 6.5%.
"We had this low-volume selloff and if it's any consolation, it didn't show a great deal of conviction way or
another," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies &Co. "Whether the next 10% move is going to be
the downside or the upside is pretty equally weighted," he said.
About 4.6 billion New York Stock Exchange-listed shares changed hands, well below the recent average.
Oil futures, which have been surging in recent weeks, fell for the second consecutive session, dropping 2% to
$70.62 per barrel. Oil hit $72.68 on Thursday, its highest level since October.
The drop in part reflected a rise in the dollar, which gained 1.5% against the euro.
The U.S. currency got a boost from Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, who said that his country has
confidence in the dollar and that its role as the primary global reserve currency is unlikely to change.
The U.S. Dollar Index was up 1.2%, while the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index was down 2.2%.
Gold futures fell 1.4% to $926.90 per troy ounce.
Treasury prices rose, especially at the longer end, sending yields lower. The yield on the 30-year bond
slipped to 4.554%.
Stocks have bounced in a relatively narrow range in the past two weeks. Since June 1, the S&P 500 had
traded mostly between 925 and 950. Monday's selloff took the S&P 500 down 2.4% to 923.72, its lowest
close since May 29.
"It was the type of move that could be easily reversed if anyone has a reason to step in and buy," said
Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at BTIG. "But the economic data we had was mildly weaker and
gave no reason to rush in."
The National Association of Home Builders reported that confidence among U.S. home builders fell after two
months of increases. A prime concern was the rise in mortgage rates that followed a recent selloff in U.S.
Treasurys.
More economic data to come this week could have a greater impact on the market. Reports on housing starts
and manufacturing activity will provide clues as to whether the economy continues to stabilize. Consumer and
producer-price index reports could shed light on whether inflation is starting to build, as some in the market
believe.

Is This Bull Cyclical or Secular? --- Signs Suggest Stocks' Surge Is Blip Within a Bear; Still, There's Opportunity

Is This Bull Cyclical or Secular? --- Signs Suggest Stocks' Surge Is Blip Within a Bear; Still, There's
Opportunity

Many investors are now calling the rebound in stocks since early March the start of a new bull market. But it
could be only a temporary respite from a longer-term bear market dating back to the beginning of this decade.
If the market is poised for a multiyear run, investors can be more aggressive about diving into stocks. If the
bear market will regain its grip on stocks and send prices lower again, investors need to be cautious.
Historical data and the still struggling economy seem to point to the latter case, called a cyclical bull market in
a secular bear market.
For now, stocks are fully in bull-market territory, even if it doesn't feel that way given the losses that many
investors are still nursing.
After falling 33.8% last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished last week 34% above its 12-year
closing low on March 9. The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index is up nearly 40% from its low on that date.
The traditional definition of a bull market is a 20% gain from a low point and a bear market is a 20% decline
from a high. But the Dow remains 38% below its record close in October 2007, and the S&P is nearly 40%
below its record.
Even those who believe a more stable economy and lots of cash sitting on the sidelines will send the market
higher remain cautious.
"We have some very substantial headwinds on the economic front," says David Pedowitz, a senior portfolio
manager at Neuberger Berman.
Consumer spending is strained and there is significant excess capacity in the manufacturing economy, he
says. Against that backdrop, expectations may be building for a bigger rebound in profits than will be
possible, says Mr. Pedowitz.
In late 2001, Ned Davis Research, a market analysis and money-management firm, raised the idea that
stocks had entered a secular bear market, a long period of flat or declining stocks. That idea gained traction
last autumn as stocks fell below levels of a decade ago.
Ned Davis considers this the fourth secular bear market since 1900. The last one, from 1966 to 1982, ended
when the Federal Reserve moved to aggressively crush inflation.
These "secular" cycles run for long periods; secular bull markets have lasted from six to 24 years and bear
markets 13 to 16 years.
Within those cycles are many more cyclical bulls and bears -- nearly three dozen of each since 1900. (Ned
Davis uses its own criteria for a cyclical bull or bear market, based largely on 30% moves.)
During a secular bull market, the cyclical, or shorter, bull markets within them gained 110% on average and
lasted nearly three years. Within secular bear markets, however, the gains in cyclical bull markets averaged
64% and generally were over within a year and a half.
That could mean the current rally has a little more than a year to run but already has made more than half its
gains. Still, stocks may not fall all the way back their lows this March. In the 1970s, for example, stocks hit
what turned out to be their low in 1974 but went on to have three more cyclical bear markets before turning
higher in 1982.

Ned Davis Research says the rise in stocks since March 9 qualifies as a bull market, but doesn't see the most
recent low as marking a transition into a new secular rally. That is in part because, according to the firm's
calculations, market valuations didn't fall far enough during the sell-off.
To calculate price-to-earnings ratios, Ned Davis focuses on as-reported earnings rather than operating profit,
which excludes lots of one-time write-offs. In addition, its researchers avoid complications caused by negative
earnings, which distort P/E ratios, and focus on the median P/E of the stocks in the S&P 500. On that basis,
the S&P fell to a P/E of roughly 12 in early March and is now just shy of 16, which compares to a 40-year
median of 16.5.
"You compare that to the 1970s where we got down to P/Es below 10 and stayed there until 1982," says Tim
Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis. The current secular bear market, he says, "is mature but it
can go on for another several years."
It is possible, Mr. Hayes says, that the current bull market will extend into next year but then get derailed by
rising interest rates and inflation. Eventually, significantly higher inflation would likely boost earnings but
depress stock prices, sending P/Es to the kinds of levels that might mark the beginning of a new secular
uptrend.
In the meantime, Mr. Hayes says investors may want to focus on what they see as a secular bull market in
commodities that has been under way for the past seven to nine years.
"We're recommending having some exposure to commodities and gold," he says.
For now, at least, those who think this is the beginning of a long-lasting bull market are few and far between.
Among them is James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. Mr. Paulsen, who
stayed largely optimistic even during the worst of last year's market collapse, in part argues that the U.S.
economy is healthier than widely believed and exports will provide a bigger boost than in the past.
Neuberger Berman's Mr. Pedowitz, meanwhile, is remaining cautious with part of the money he manages,
while another portion is making more aggressive bets. "You want to maintain a balance in the portfolio
between defensive and offensive" holdings, he says.
He's keeping roughly 15% of his portfolios in cash. "That gives you plenty of capital if the market retreats and
some dry powder" should bargains appear.
He also has stocks that he counts as defensive, such as Cisco Systems and Oracle, which should profit as
companies try to improve their efficiency during a tough economy. He also likes Teva Pharmaceuticals as a
firm that he believes will benefit from health-care reform, unlike many other companies in the sector.
Then, for the offensive side of his portfolio, Mr. Pedowitz owns J.P. Morgan Chase, along with economically
sensitive stocks such as manufacturers Danaher and Roper Industries.
It's simply too early to tell whether the March 9 lows were merely a cyclical bull market or the start of a
secular bull, says Milton Ezrati, market strategist at Lord Abbett. "That will depend on how durable the
economic recovery is," he says. "The jury is still out."
But he believes there are opportunities in companies whose stocks do best early in an economic cycle, such
as industrials, some commodities and consumer-discretionary stocks. "We can see this rally being sustained,
although there could be short-term corrections," Mr. Ezrati says.
Some financials make a "good trading play," he says, and could rally as concerns about bad real-estate loans
start to fade as the economy stabilizes. However, "there are questions about their fundamental businesses"
that could cap gains over the next year or two.
Neuberger Berman's Mr. Pedowitz has a word of caution for investors. "Make absolutely sure you have been
humbled enough by the markets to know that you can't really tell if this is a cyclical or secular bull market."

Stocks in the Black On Gusher of Cash

With a 34% rebound in three months, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has pushed into positive territory for
2009, and one of the main reasons is disarmingly simple: Financial markets once again are awash in
government cash.
The Dow rose 28.34 points to 8799.26 on Friday, as money managers continued shifting funds into stocks.
Still, the Dow remains down 38% from its 2007 record of 14164.53, and it had seemed to plateau in recent
weeks on worries about the strength of the global recovery.
But governments around the world are pumping money into the economy at a frenetic pace. Because
businesses can't put trillions of new dollars to work in such a short time, the money is finding its way into
financial markets. Some investors have begun speaking of a "bailout bubble" being created in certain
markets, and about a "melt-up" in demand fueled by the growing supply of money.
"All that money that was printed had to go somewhere," says Joachim Fels, co-head of global economics at
Morgan Stanley. "It has been pushing up commodity prices and stock prices, starting in emerging markets
and then pushing over into developed markets."
The U.S. government alone has allocated $11.4 trillion to direct and indirect stimulus in the past two years, of
which about $2.4 trillion has been spent, according to an estimate by Daniel Clifton, head of policy research
at New York's Strategas Research Partners. Most of the money has been pushed out in the past year.
The money is gushing from direct grants, central-bank lending, tax breaks, guarantees and other items.
China has announced plans for $600 billion in direct stimulus spending; Russia, $290 billion; Britain, $147
billion; and Japan, $155 billion, according to Strategas. Those countries and others are spending trillions
more indirectly.
"It is quite easily the biggest combined fiscal stimulus the world has ever seen in modern times," says Jim
O'Neill, chief economist at Goldman Sachs. "That liquidity will impact anything that is sensitive to it, ranging
from short-term fixed-income securities through stock prices through property prices and into people's
personal wealth."
Some of the market gains, of course, reflect a bet by investors that the worst of the global recession is over,
and that investments tied to global growth will be big beneficiaries. The heavy influx of money into the
financial system has fueled those bets.
If the recession proves more lasting than the optimists believe, liquidity alone may not be enough to keep
financial markets rising. American consumers, whose outlays account for more than two-thirds of U.S.
economic output, have only begun to rein in spending and reduce debt, a process many economists expect to
continue for years.
The growing liquidity also is creating serious policy challenges. Senior economists, including Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke in congressional testimony on June 3, have begun warning that the government
can't keep piling up debt at current rates without creating severe financial problems.
In coming years, officials will need to raise taxes, cut spending, or both to mop up the ocean of liquidity they
have created. That process could weigh on growth and stifle the market boom.
Meanwhile, yields of government bonds are rising in anticipation of heavy federal borrowing, and higher
yields also hamper growth. On Friday, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes eased a bit to 3.783%, still well up
from 2.203% in mid-January.
If the government fails to mop up the money, the consequence could be even worse: inflation and a
collapsing dollar.

--- Page 37 ---

Past liquidity-driven booms haven't ended well. In 1998, the Federal Reserve injected cash into the economy
to rescue teetering bond markets. The unintended outcome: Technology stocks soared and then cratered.
After the government turned on the spigot in 2001 to stave off deflation, residential real estate surged and
then collapsed.
Now, although almost all markets still are far from past highs, bubbles may be starting to inflate again in
speculative foreign markets and other investments linked to global economic growth.
Silver is up 59% from December lows on futures markets; copper is up 90%; corn, 45%; and crude oil, 113%.
Ukraine's stock market is up 125%, Vietnam's 116%, Indonesia's 76% and India's 87% from winter lows.
In Shanghai, crowds are back on weekends on Guangdong Road, where locals gather to chat stocks. Tan
Viet Securities Co. in Hanoi says it is opening or reactivating 50 accounts a day, up from five to seven in
March. Optima Securities, a brokerage firm in Indonesia, says the number of new accounts has doubled in
the last three months.
The oil-price rebound is boosting costly projects such as western Canada's oil-sands fields. Imperial Oil Ltd.,
majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp., said May 25 that it is moving ahead with a delayed $8 billion project
near Kearl Lake. Canada's stock index is up 41% since March 9.
U.S. markets have been among the tamer ones, although some stocks demolished in the downturn have
surged, such as banks and home builders. So have companies linked to foreign growth, including
Freeport-McMoRan Copper &Gold Inc. and Caterpillar Inc.
U.S. companies have reacted to the easier money by issuing new stocks and bonds. In May, Dealogic
reported, more new stock was issued by existing companies in U.S. markets than at any time since 1995,
when it began keeping records. May issuance of new dollar-denominated junk bonds was the heaviest since
June 2007, and the fifth-highest monthly level on record.
Worries are spreading that, like previous liquidity-driven market surges, this one could end badly, though
many investors believe that won't happen soon.
Money supply in major countries, as measured by cash and checking accounts, has been rising sharply
relative to gross domestic product, or total value of goods and services, Morgan Stanley reports. Money
supply relative to GDP is at the highest level of any period covered by Morgan Stanley's data, which go back
to the 1970s.
That measure of money supply has tended to move in line with bull and bear markets. It was declining in the
late 1980s, ahead of the 1987 crash and the 1990 bear market. It started expanding in 1995, as a major bull
market began. It started pulling back in March 2000, as the stock market fell. It then began expanding at the
start of 2001, ahead of the next bull, only to top out again at the end of 2006, ahead of the next bear. Now it is
surging again.
A growing number of money managers are jumping back into stocks, some fearing they will fall behind the
surging indexes or believing the world economy finally is poised to recover, led by developing countries.
"We're past the crisis," says Jeff Schappe, chief investment officer at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh,
N.C. "The most attractive opportunities are probably going to be in emerging markets and commodities over
time."
Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer at Artio Global Investors, a money-management arm of Zurich
financial group Julius Baer Holdings, says that at some point, the stock market "probably has to correct. But
right now, a lot of it is a reflection of the policies that global central banks and politicians have pursued, which
are: Reflate at any cost. My guess is that it probably will run longer than fundamentals will dictate it should,"
just as the tech-stock and the real-estate bubbles did before they finally popped.

Rahm Emanuel was only giving voice to widespread political wisdom when he said that a crisis should never
be "wasted." Crises enable vastly accelerated political agendas and initiatives scarcely conceivable under
calmer circumstances. So it goes now.
Here we stand more than a year into a grave economic crisis with a projected budget deficit of 13% of GDP.
That's more than twice the size of the next largest deficit since World War II. And this projected deficit is the
culmination of a year when the federal government, at taxpayers' expense, acquired enormous stakes in the
banking, auto, mortgage, health-care and insurance industries.
With the crisis, the ill-conceived government reactions, and the ensuing economic downturn, the unfunded
liabilities of federal programs -- such as Social Security, civil-service and military pensions, the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation, Medicare and Medicaid -- are over the $100 trillion mark. With U.S. GDP and
federal tax receipts at about $14 trillion and $2.4 trillion respectively, such a debt all but guarantees higher
interest rates, massive tax increases, and partial default on government promises.
But as bad as the fiscal picture is, panic-driven monetary policies portend to have even more dire
consequences. We can expect rapidly rising prices and much, much higher interest rates over the next four
or five years, and a concomitant deleterious impact on output and employment not unlike the late 1970s.
About eight months ago, starting in early September 2008, the Bernanke Fed did an abrupt about-face and
radically increased the monetary base -- which is comprised of currency in circulation, member bank reserves
held at the Fed, and vault cash -- by a little less than $1 trillion. The Fed controls the monetary base 100%
and does so by purchasing and selling assets in the open market. By such a radical move, the Fed signaled a
180-degree shift in its focus from an anti-inflation position to an anti-deflation position.
The percentage increase in the monetary base is the largest increase in the past 50 years by a factor of 10. It
is so far outside the realm of our prior experiential base that historical comparisons are rendered difficult if not
meaningless. The currency-in-circulation component of the monetary base -- which prior to the expansion had
comprised 95% of the monetary base -- has risen by a little less than 10%, while bank reserves have
increased almost 20-fold. Now the currency-in-circulation component of the monetary base is a smidgen less
than 50% of the monetary base. Yikes!
Bank reserves are crucially important because they are the foundation upon which banks are able to expand
their liabilities and thereby increase the quantity of money.
Banks are required to hold a certain fraction of their liabilities -- demand deposits and other checkable
deposits -- in reserves held at the Fed or in vault cash. Prior to the huge increase in bank reserves, banks
had been constrained from expanding loans by their reserve positions. They weren't able to inject liquidity into
the economy, which had been so desperately needed in response to the liquidity crisis that began in 2007
and continued into 2008. But since last September, all of that has changed. Banks now have huge amounts
of excess reserves, enabling them to make lots of net new loans.
The way a bank or the banking system makes new loans is conceptually pretty simple. Banks find an entity
that they believe to be credit-worthy that also wants a loan, and in exchange for the new company's IOU (i.e.,
loan) the bank opens up a checking account for the customer. For the bank's sake, the hope is that the
interest paid by the borrower more than makes up for the cost and risk of the loan. The recently ballyhooed
"stress tests" on banks are nothing more than checking how well a bank can weather differing levels of
default risk.
What's important for the overall economy, however, is how fast these loans are made and how rapidly the
quantity of money increases. For our purposes, money is the sum total of all currency in circulation, bank
demand deposits, other checkable deposits, and travelers checks (economists call this M1). When reserve

constraints on banks are removed, it does take the banks time to make new loans. But given sufficient time,
they will make enough new loans until they are once again reserve constrained. The expansion of money,
given an increase in the monetary base, is inevitable, and will ultimately result in higher inflation and interest
rates. In shorter time frames, the expansion of money can also result in higher stock prices, a weaker
currency, and increases in commodity prices such as oil and gold.
At present, banks are doing just what we would expect them to do. They are making new loans and
increasing overall bank liabilities (i.e., money). The 12-month growth rate of M1 is now in the 15% range, and
close to its highest level in the past half century.
With an increased trust in the overall banking system, the panic demand for money has begun to and should
continue to recede. The dramatic drop in output and employment in the U.S. economy will also reduce the
demand for money. Reduced demand for money combined with rapid growth in money is a surefire recipe for
inflation and higher interest rates. The higher interest rates themselves will also further reduce the
demand for money, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures. It's a catch-22.
It's difficult to estimate the magnitude of the inflationary and interest-rate consequences of the Fed's actions
because, frankly, we haven't ever seen anything like this in the U.S. To date what's happened is potentially
far more inflationary than were the monetary policies of the 1970s, when the prime interest rate peaked at
21.5% and inflation peaked in the low double digits. Gold prices went from $35 per ounce to $850 per
ounce, and the dollar collapsed on the foreign exchanges. It wasn't a pretty picture.
Now the Fed can, and I believe should, do what it must to mitigate the inevitable consequences of its
unwarranted increase in the monetary base. It should contract the monetary base back to where it otherwise
would have been, plus a slight increase geared toward economic expansion. Absent this major contraction in
the monetary base, the Fed should increase reserve requirements on member banks to absorb the excess
reserves. Given that banks are now paid interest on their reserves and short-term rates are very low, raising
reserve requirements should not exact too much of a penalty on the banking system, and the long-term gains
of the lessened inflation would many times over warrant whatever short-term costs there might be.
Alas, I doubt very much that the Fed will do what is necessary to guard against future inflation and higher
interest rates. If the Fed were to reduce the monetary base by $1 trillion, it would need to sell a net $1 trillion
in bonds. This would put the Fed in direct competition with Treasury's planned issuance of about $2 trillion
worth of bonds over the coming 12 months. Failed auctions would become the norm and bond prices would
tumble, reflecting a massive oversupply of government bonds.
In addition, a rapid contraction of the monetary base as I propose would cause a contraction in bank lending,
or at best limited expansion. This is exactly what happened in 2000 and 2001 when the Fed contracted the
monetary base the last time. The economy quickly dipped into recession. While the short-term pain of a
deepened recession is quite sharp, the long-term consequences of double-digit inflation are devastating. For
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke it's a Hobson's choice. For me the issue is how to protect assets for my
grandchildren.

Procter's Gamble: Down-Market Move
Value remains the hottest trend in the market for consumer products. But should Procter &Gamble pick up
the fad a year and a half into the recession?
The household-products giant generated blockbuster growth earlier in the decade after convincing shoppers
to pay more for higher-quality detergents and diapers. But as consumers tighten their belts, they are turning
more to lower-priced alternatives, leaving P&G's premium offerings on the shelves, stifling its sales.
So P&G has stepped back from its strategy, declaring its intention on May 28 to focus more on the
cost-conscious shopper. The U-turn came from P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley, whose tenure in that
position now appears to be nearing an end. He said the company will expand its range of prices to meet the
new consumer mentality, which he expects to last.
He may have had no choice. P&G's sales underperformed those of rivals before the recession began. In
2007, the company's organic sales growth was the second lowest of a group of 12 large consumer-products
companies, according to J.P. Morgan's John Faucher. That same year, P&G was gaining share in 25 product
categories but losing share in 29, Mr. Faucher said. That underperformance has continued since.
Perhaps partly as a result, P&G's stock has lagged behind Colgate-Palmolive's and Clorox's since December
2007. That has tarnished its reputation as a defensive stock in economic downturns, even though it did better
than the broader market last year.
P&G's focus on value should help it regain market share. Stronger sales of Luvs diapers, for instance, are a
welcome substitute when demand for pricier Pampers is soft.
The trouble is, shifting the emphasis to lower-priced goods likely means P&G's margins will narrow. That
means P&G will either need to ramp up sales volumes or sell consumers on quality again when the economy
turns.
Consumers probably will be willing to spend on brand-name razors and soaps when employment levels
normalize. Deutsche Bank's Bill Schmitz said such items account for just 0.5% of disposable income. After
the recession of the early 1990s, consumer demand for higher-quality products increased significantly, Mr.
Schmitz said.
To position itself to go back upmarket, though, P&G needs to make sure its recent decision to downshift
doesn't affect its premium brands. Philip Morris's 1993 cigarette price cut on "Marlboro Friday" led to a price
war that made it harder for tobacco companies to raise prices even when the economy was stronger.
P&G now trades at 14.6 times estimated calendar-year earnings, versus Colgate's 16.8 times. That isn't the
bargain it might appear. With P&G still paying catch-up on its response to the recession, while also
positioning itself for any upturn, investors have plenty to fear.

Junk Debt Gives Hope for Buyout Barons
At last, a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel for private equity. The European high-yield bond market is
gradually reopening.
Logistics group IFCO Systems' issue last week marked the first refinancing of a private-equity-backed
company in nearly two years. Funding for leveraged buyouts, however, may take longer to recover.

--- Page 43 ---
Page 43 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The market thaw is limited to the strongest credits, such as Pernod Ricard, which lost its investment-grade
rating after buying Vin &Sprit, and safer sectors such as telecommunications and cable. IFCO's 200 million
euro ($279.3 million) bond issue is actually an anomaly as its double-B credit ratings are higher than those of
many private-equity-backed firms.
Even so, the market appears to be edging back to normality. Euro junk-bond spreads, which peaked at 23.26
percentage points over government bonds in December, have tightened to 14.64 percentage points,
according to Merrill Lynch indexes. Investors have enjoyed returns of 36% year to date.
That has drawn new money into the market: By June 3, 12 consecutive weeks of inflows had netted $6.8
billion for U.S. high-yield bond funds, according to AMG Data Services. Borrowers will welcome lower costs.
IFCO paid a yield of 10.875%, not too far above coupons on some investment-grade bond sales.
That is reassuring for European private-equity groups facing a wave of debt refinancing in 2012. But it doesn't
necessarily mean support for buyouts, which typically carry a single-B rating. That depends partly on the
economy allowing high-yield companies to expand out of their debt-laden capital structures. For the first time
in many months, though, private equity can dare to hope.

FX Flows Amazon's Way
Looking for a reason to buy Amazon.com, even as the shares near their late-2007 highs?
The e-commerce behemoth has more to gain than many other big Web companies from the dollar's slide over
the past few months. Even though Amazon derives about half its sales from overseas, it doesn't hedge its
foreign-currency exposure, unlike other companies with similar levels of overseas sales, such as Google and
eBay.
While that approach left Amazon more exposed to the dollar's rally last year, it will ensure Amazon gets the
full benefit as the currency falls.
Moreover, that benefit will be felt disproportionately on Amazon's bottom line. Its operating margins are higher
internationally, at 7.4% in the first quarter compared with 5.8% domestically, presumably reflecting Amazon's
location of its research and development and corporate overhead in the U.S.
In the first quarter, Amazon pointed to foreign-currency moves for depressing sales by $268 million, or about
5%, but reducing operating income by 12%.
Admittedly, despite having slid 12% against the euro from early March to last week, before rallying in recent
days, the dollar still is higher than a year ago. That means Amazon's second-quarter results still will be hurt
by foreign-exchange moves year on year. But if the dollar stays flat for the rest of the year, Amazon will see
benefits.
-- Martin Peers
Fed to Show
Some Reserve
On Rate Moves
One sure bet in today's uncertain markets: The Federal Reserve's next move on short-term interest rates will
be up. But investors are ahead of themselves on the timing.
Following Friday's not-as-bad-as-expected U.S. job-destruction data, markets are pricing in a rate increase by
year-end.
Fed-funds futures predict an interest rate of half a percentage point by year-end and 1% by next March, from
today's rate of zero to 0.25%. The two-year Treasury yield jumped from 0.95% Thursday to 1.41% Monday.
Understandably, as investors factor in a stabilizing economy, stocks have risen and credit spreads have
tightened. Long-dated Treasurys have sold off, facing a supply surge and having run up too far during
previous panic buying.
That all makes sense, even if the scale of the moves is open to debate.

--- Page 44 ---
Page 44 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Yet the idea of a Fed interest-rate increase this year looks misplaced. On inflation, the central bank rightly
believes there is plenty of economic slack to restrain prices in the near term. It is unlikely to raise rates
without evidence of a stronger economy and turn in unemployment, which is now at 9.4% and rising.
Finally, the Fed is likely to pull other levers before returning to conventional monetary policy.
One would be ending its program of mortgage-security and Treasury purchases, while providing clarity on
how it proposes to roll them back. It also might be expected to end or tighten the terms of other programs,
such as that supporting the commercial-paper market, first.
Barring a miraculous economic rebound in the next couple of quarters, the Fed is likely to hold fire.
-- Thorold Barker
Overheard
There is a growing buzz in the hedge-fund world about shares of Gabriel Resources, a Toronto gold-mining
company that has spent years wrestling with environmentalists. In the first quarter, John Paulson's Paulson
&Co. lifted its stake by nearly six million shares, to 18%. Other funds that are bullish on gold also are eyeing
the stock, which is down 25% to 2.19 Canadian dollars ($1.96) in the past year despite the resilient gold
price. Gabriel's main asset: a majority stake in a large Romanian gold mine. The problem: That mine
produces no gold.
Environmentalists have long been hot under the collar, worried about potential cyanide poisoning. Their
protests have helped block Gabriel's decadelong efforts to open a modern mine at the site, known as Rosia
Montana. Yet as gold fever continues to rage, the hedge funds appear to be banking on yellow trumping
green.

Gold, Metals Slide On Dollar's Strength

Gold, Metals Slide On Dollar's Strength

Gold and other precious metals tumbled as the dollar strengthened against the euro.
"There is one all-encompassing theme and that is the well-bid U.S. dollar," said Bart Melek, global commodity
strategist with BMO Capital Markets.
Investors often buy gold as a hedge when the dollar weakens, and conversely sell on greenback strength.
Gold looked like it might hit $1,000 a troy ounce last week, but since has fallen. On Monday, gold for June
delivery fell $10, or 1%, to $951.70, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, while
most-active August gold lost $10.10 to $952.50.
Nearby June silver fell 43.3 cents, or 2.8%, to $14.943 an ounce, while most-active July fell 43.3 cents to
$14.955.
Nearby and most-active Nymex July platinum fell $42.20 to $1,244 an ounce. Nearby June palladium lost
$7.80 to $251.25 an ounce, while most-active September palladium slid $7.80 to $252.
"There was fund selling in the whole complex," said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets
Global Futures.
During another selloff triggered by dollar strength Friday, Comex gold open interest fell nearly 10,000
contracts, Mr. Gero said. That was a sign of long liquidating, which appeared to continue Monday, he said. A
long position is an expectation of higher prices.
"And that long liquidation helped accelerate the sell stops," he said, referring to preplaced orders.
Weekly data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed potential for liquidation,
with large speculators holding their biggest net long positions in gold and silver since last summer.
"I think there is a little more downside to this, as long as the dollar continues to rally," said Daniel Pavilonis,
senior market strategist with Lind-Waldock. He said he looks for gold to start rising again whenever the
dollar's rally runs its course.
Silver fell more on a relative basis than gold, perhaps because it had risen more lately, Mr. Melek said.
"Therefore, it's unwinding a little bit more," he said.
In other commodity trading on Monday:
CRUDE OIL: Futures fluctuated around $68 a barrel, ending slightly lower, as the dollar rebounded, lessening
the appeal of commodities as a hedge against dollar devaluation and possibly inflation. Light, sweet crude oil
for July delivery settled 35 cents lower, or 0.5%, at $68.09 a barrel on the Nymex.
NATURAL GAS: Futures fell, pressured lower by mild weather and an abundance of gas in storage, with few
signs emerging of a rebound in demand, particularly from industrial users. Gas for July delivery on the Nymex
settled 13.7 cents lower, or 3.5%, at $3.731 a million British thermal units.

In Rising Crude Prices, Some See '08 Replay --- Climb Has Been Faster Than Last Year's

The rapid rise in the price of crude-oil futures, which touched $70 on Friday, is sparking fears of a repeat of
last year's energy rollercoaster.
Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday hit $70.32 before closing down 37 cents at
$68.44. Prices remain well below what they were a year ago, when oil was selling for more than $125 a
barrel, but the climb in recent months has been even steeper than last year's.
Prices have more than doubled since closing at $33.98 on Feb. 12, the recent low. They're up more than 50%
since the start of 2009, compared to a 33% rise during the same period last year.
Experts see two main forces behind the recent rise in prices that echo last year's climb.
First, investors are putting money into oil as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar; last year,
investors were guarding against a weakening stock market.
Second, investors are betting that early signs of economic recovery suggest a looming shortage of oil. A year
ago, oil bulls argued rising demand in China and India would lead demand to outstrip supply.
"What we are seeing here is a replay . . . It's the same phenomenon," said Ann-Louise Hittle, head of oil
market analysis for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
To be sure, there are significant differences between this year and last. A year ago, the global economy was
cooling but not yet in recession, and demand for oil was still rising worldwide. OPEC, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, was producing at close to its maximum rate.
Now demand is falling. The International Energy Agency predicts global oil consumption will be 3% lower in
2009 than in 2008. And OPEC members are producing millions of barrels a day below their capacity.
Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil stockpiles are 19% higher than a year ago, according to the Energy Information
Administration. That's enough to meet 25 days of U.S. demand, up from 20 days a year ago.
Some analysts warn that with prices being driven by investor sentiment, not market fundamentals, the leap in
prices could give way to an equally sharp drop -- just like last year.
"There may be enough momentum to carry us up to just $72.50, but then I think the correction is going to be
just that dramatic," said Guy Gleichmann, president of United Strategic Investors Group, a commodities
brokerage in Hollywood, Fla.
The rise in energy costs could slow down recovery from the recession, some economists suggest. Retail
gasoline prices have risen 23% since the end of April, to $2.52 per gallon on average. Tom Kloza, chief oil
analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, warned that could lead more consumers to pull back spending.
But there are signs that oil producers, many of which slashed spending when prices were falling, are gaining
confidence in the price recovery.
The Russian oil company TNK-BP this week said it would increase its capital spending by $400 million to
$3.7 billion, Reuters reported. Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest Western oil company, has in recent days
announced investments in large, long-term projects, which analysts said will be viewed as a green-light for
others to pick up the pace of their spending.
That increase could boost supplies, easing pressure on prices as demand eventually recovers. Oil producers
have warned for months that reduced drilling could lead to supply shortages when the recession ends.

In this column, we answer your questions about alternative investments. Send them to reports@wsj.com.
Q: Do alternative investments still make sense in light of the drubbing that many have taken in the past year?
If so, which look best?
A: Alternative investments, a broad category that includes everything from hedge funds to tracts of timber,
suffered surprising losses last year. Hedge funds dropped 19% of their value. And most other investments
that were supposed to zig when the market zagged -- including convertible bonds, real estate and even
precious metals -- did much worse than expected, as investors dumped all kinds of investments. Too many of
these investments relied on borrowed money to pump up their returns. When lenders pulled that back, the
returns were impacted.
Still, alternative investments should remain a key part of a portfolio, most analysts argue. For one thing, many
did better than the overall stock market, especially mutual funds and other vehicles that can short, or bet
against, stocks. Last year -- when almost every kind of stock and bond was punished -- demonstrated that a
traditional mix of stocks and bonds often doesn't provide sufficient diversification, says Tim Bearden,
managing partner of Stonebridge Financial Partners LLC, who recommends some real-estate investments as
well as "managed futures" funds, or those that bet on currencies and commodities, among other things.
Alternative investments also tend to do better when inflations rises, something that some economists expect
over the next few years on the heels of the efforts by governments around the world to pump out money to
stem the economic downturn.
"When inflation sets in, stock returns will be confined to earnings and dividend growth," says Sean Figueroa,
a principal at Cypress Wealth Advisors LLC.
Joseph Curtin, a managing director at Bank of America Corp., is a fan of timberland, farmland and
commodities. "There are some phenomenal opportunities that are developing for the intermediate to
long-term investor," he says.
For eligible investors, Mr. Curtin recommends hedge funds that invest in "distressed" debt, among other
areas, as well as private-equity firms that focus on smaller buyouts and innovative areas, like "clean tech," or
technology that improves performance while reducing environmental impact.
"As the economy starts to show a staged recovery, and sellers come to accept that buyers are willing to pay
much less, there will be significant opportunities in the opportunistic real-estate sector," Mr. Curtin predicts.
But scandals at firms like Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities and Stanford Financial Group are a
reminder that firms that focus on alternative-type investments need an extra dose of scrutiny, because many
focus on products that aren't well-regulated or don't trade on public exchanges. Many of the firms themselves
aren't registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or can avoid much scrutiny.
Q: Do gold and silver coins look attractive and why is there such a premium lately to purchase them?
A: A conundrum in the market has been that gold and silver prices moved higher in the past six months, but
there's been an even bigger rush of interest in gold and silver coins. These coins often serve as a good
hedge against inflation, and store value nicely amid weakness in markets and economies. Fears about both
scenarios have spurred interest in these coins.
Coins usually cost a bit more than their gold and silver content, due to the expense of producing and
distributing them. But the premiums have been higher than usual lately, especially in regards to silver --
usually considered a poorer man's alternative to gold.

--- Page 50 ---
Page 50 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Premiums on some silver coins have been as much as 20% above the "spot" price in the market for silver.
Part of the reason is that small investors continue to flock to precious metals, but gold futures have come
under periodic pressure, especially when large investors sold investments to raise cash.
"The premium is more conspicuous now because of the low-cost alternatives," says J. Scott Miller of Blue
Bell Private Wealth Management LLC, referring to exchange-traded funds that focus on gold and silver.
Though they're much easier to handle than gold bars, there's still a cost to store coins securely. A bank
safe-deposit box or a floor safe is recommended. Collectible coins can scratch or damage; silver can tarnish.
Since there's no active market to trade coins, it's never clear if a buyer or seller is getting a good price.
Unscrupulous dealers can take advantage of investors, especially since not all coins are the same due to
rarity and condition.
Rob Lutts, chief investment officer of investment firm Cabot Money Management, anticipates that coins will
do well as an investment and recommends that investors place 5% to 10% of their assets in gold-related
investments. But he prefers precious-metals exchange-traded funds, such as US SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), or
an ETF focused on mining companies, such as US Market Vectors -- Gold Miners ETF (GDX).

Gold Ends a Volatile Week at $961.70

Gold Ends a Volatile Week at $961.70

Gold futures ended a volatile week with a thump, and the ups and downs in the metal may indicate the
market has peaked for the time being, shy of the $1,000 mark.
Late Friday in New York, the thinly traded nearby June gold contract lost $19.50, or 2%, to settle at $961.70
a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active August contract
declined $19.70 to $962.60.
Fund selling clipped gold futures as stronger-than-expected payrolls data sapped their haven allure and a
strong U.S. dollar pressured prices. In the previous session, the most-active contract ended $16.70 an ounce
higher after an $18.80 fall on Wednesday.
"When you get that type of volatility, it's often an indicator of a change in trend," said Michael Gross, broker
and futures analyst with OptionSellers.com. "We could be seeing a top in gold."
Gold has been strengthening recently in part on alternative currency buying by speculative funds as the
dollar has been weakening. That peak could be coming as the dollar begins to stabilize and funds unwind
dollar- and inflation-hedge investments, Mr. Gross said.
Amid some promising data, such as stronger-than-expected payrolls numbers on Friday, participants are
beginning to focus on an improving economy, Mr. Gross said.
While that could prove inflationary in the long term, in the short term it will help the U.S. currency and will take
away some haven buying from gold, Mr. Gross said.
"This looks a lot like a top," said Sterling Smith, vice president with FuturesOne. He sees support at $960 an
ounce and then between $944 and $940. "A near-term pullback here seems likely with our inability to take out
a thousand bucks," Mr. Smith said.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures ended slightly lower, as traders took a breather from setting Thursday's seven-month
high amid concerns about the state of the U.S. economy. Light, sweet crude oil for July delivery settled 37

Oil Price as Threat to Recovery

Oil Price as Threat to Recovery

NEW YORK -- As oil prices have increased, so have concerns the steady climb will snuff out an economic
recovery.
But analysts say oil prices have to soar well past $70 a barrel before an impact would register.
Light, sweet crude oil for July delivery set a fresh seven-month high on Thursday, rising $2.69, or 4.1%, to
$68.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Prices have roughly doubled since February, as more and more investors have signed on to the idea that
major economies will soon begin to pull out of their slump. The mere hint of promising developments in the
U.S. housing market or the Chinese manufacturing sector has been enough to send oil soaring.
Goldman Sachs Group analysts this week said they see the oil market returning to "energy crisis" footing
once economies are on the path to recovery, with shortages by the second half of next year and prices hitting
$95 at the end of 2010. The bank also increased its end-of-2009 price forecast 31% to $85 a barrel.
The oil rally of the past few months has led to higher prices at the pump. The more consumers pay to fill their
tanks, the less they have to spend on other goods that would resuscitate the wider economy. Some analysts
worry that a price surge could kill any chance of the economy bouncing back well before Goldman Sachs's
scenario plays out.
That talk may be premature. The average U.S. gasoline price last week topped $2.50 a gallon for the first
time since October, but it still is well below a year earlier. While U.S. consumers may find their budgets
stretched by rising prices, their counterparts in many developing countries can rely on government price
controls to keep down energy costs. "I would get seriously concerned if we were back toward $100," said
David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &Poor's.
Oil's plunge from a record above $145 a barrel last summer to the low $30s in early 2009 restored about
$250 billion in U.S. household purchasing power, Mr. Wyss said. The latest rally has taken about $50 billion
back out of consumers' pockets.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices rose on inflation-hedge buying after profit-taking and a stronger dollar hit the metal on
Wednesday. Thinly traded Comex June gold rose $16.70 to $981.20 an ounce, while the most-active August
contract rose $16.70 to $982.30.
CORN: Prices surged. The market has fundamental support as the U.S. crop was planted late and is being
hindered by unseasonably cool weather. Chicago Board of Trade July corn rose 16 cents to $4.4850 a
bushel.

Not so long ago, we were warned about the prospect of devastating deflation, a widespread decline in wages
and prices. Today, we hear equally dire warnings of an outbreak of inflation. It's like preparing for an epochal
drought and suddenly being told, "Never mind! Get ready for a flood of Biblical proportions."
As recently as mid-March, minutes of Federal Reserve deliberations show, several Fed officials thought
"inflation was likely to persist below desirable levels." But at the end of April, theyconcluded, with a sigh of
relief, that "the risk of a protracted period of deflation had diminished," thanks to massive government
spending and tax cuts and aggressive central-bank lending. Now Fed officials find themselves on the
defensive, accused of doing so much to avert deflation and depression that inflation is nearly inevitable.
An immediate outbreak of inflation is improbable. Consumer prices in industrialized countries have risen less
in the past year (0.6%) than in any 12 months since the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development began keeping records in 1971. In the U.S., unemployment is at 8.9%, and forecasters see it
hovering above 9% into 2011. American industry is operating further from full capacity than at any time since
the Fed began keeping track in 1948. It's hard to see companies easily raising prices or workers winning
raises. The standard ingredients of inflation -- too much money chasing too few goods -- aren't in evidence.
The bigger question is what's ahead. Markets are anxious. The bond market has pushed up yields on
Treasury debt. Gold is nearing $1,000 an ounce again. Commodity prices are rising. It's easy to cite historical
precedents for heavily indebted governments accepting inflation as a way to lighten the burden of repayment
or for central banks overdoing whatever they're doing.
But what would have to happen for inflation to soar above the 2% target that most Fed officials set for their
favorite gauge?
A miscalculation. The Fed and President Barack Obama's economists could be worrying too much about
avoiding 1937-38 (when premature tightening plunged the U.S. economy back into recession) and not
enough about 2004 (when the Fed may have kept short-term rates too low too long). Or there could be less
slack in the economy than appears on the surface, a view held by some inside the Fed. Or the prospect of
10% unemployment on Election Day 2010 could prompt Democrats to push another round of fiscal stimulus --
or another set of corporate bailouts -- that proves unneeded and doesn't spur the Fed to raise interest rates.
A miscalculation would produce big inflation only if the Fed failed to see and react to it.
A failure of will. The Fed could lack the fortitude to raise rates and drain credit, a worry among some Fed
insiders who complain, "There is no exit strategy." The problem is human and political. To avoid inflation, the
Fed must move sooner than citizens and politicians will like. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke vows to be tough,
but he hasn't been tested on this side of the monetary mountain -- and his term expires in January 2010. He
or his successor may find Fed lending so intertwined with the Treasury's bailouts that the Fed lacks the
flexibility and independence it needs. Or he may find tightening tough while Congress is contemplating
changes to the Fed's governance and powers. Or the budget deficit may be so large that the Fed is unwilling
to curtail its bond buying and raise rates sufficiently to offset it. The Fed is mighty, but its leaders human --
and prone to failures of courage as well as wisdom.
A victim of circumstance. Plenty of indebted emerging-market countries have seen currencies collapse as
global lenders flee. A falling exchange rate pushes up the prices of imports and can produce inflation even
while unemployment remains high. The U.S., still the keeper of the world's most popular currency, is not
Argentina. But its addiction to borrowing from abroad makes it more like an emerging market than ever. A
collapse in the dollar could push up oil prices (which rise when the dollar falls) and other import prices. Even if
that didn't spark inflation, it could prompt an untimely increase in interest rates. Reducing this risk means
moving soon to restrain the long-term budget deficit so creditors are less likely to bolt.

A self-fulfilling fear. Unemployment may be high and the Fed vigilant, but if consumers, workers, businesses
and investors all expect inflation, they could realize their fears -- by pushing up prices and demanding higher
wages in a mania that defies the assertions of economists and Fed officials that there's no reason for
inflation. Inflation expectations are not always tethered to objective economic reality. Mr. Bernanke's
repeated vows to maintain price stability are aimed at keeping those expectations under control.
In late 1970s, central bankers printed so much money that we got the Great Inflation. That ended painfully in
the deep recession of the early '80s and taught everyone a never-again lesson. During the Great Panic of our
time, the Fed and its counterparts did whatever it took to prevent depression and deflation. The question now
is whether central bankers and the rest of us will remember the lessons of the late '70s and do whatever it
takes to avoid inflation. Or whether each generation has to learn the lesson anew.

Gold Runs Back Toward $1,000 an Ounce --- Rising Global Buying and Inflation Fears Make a Mockery

Gold is reaping the benefits of both sides of the debate over whether the world's central banks can stimulate
the global economy without sparking a surge in inflation.
On Tuesday, gold settled at $983.20 a troy ounce, up 0.5%, and is now just 2% shy of its all-time high of
$1,003.20 scored in March 2008.
Among the main drivers is the decline in the U.S. dollar -- a result, many analysts say, of a conviction that the
global economy is on the path to recovery, thanks to central banks' stimulus efforts. Dollar-denominated
commodities like gold typically rise when the dollar falls, as producers ask for higher prices and consumers
outside the U.S. buy more. While the dollar has dropped 9% since mid-April, gold has gained 13%.
Also fueling the rally has been the fear that the Federal Reserve and others won't be able to control inflation
once those stimulus efforts kick in. Hard assets like gold are seen as a good hedge against rising prices as
they tend to retain their value.
The rally has caught many in the market off guard. Gold has averaged $910 this year, surpassing analysts'
forecast of $881, as calculated by the London Bullion Market Association.
HSBC in May raised its 2009 gold forecast by $50 to $875 an ounce; French investment bank Natixis
recently said it expected gold to average $885 this year.
Though many believe the momentum will take gold across the $1,000 mark again, even the most bullish
investors are predicting a pause in the metal's ascent.
"I think we are getting into the final part of this particular rally," said Philip Klapwijk, executive chairman of
GFMS Ltd., a London metals-research house. His forecast for gold's average price is $970, one of the
highest among 24 analysts LBMA polled.
The higher price will further encourage scrap sales and depress jewelry demand, "which is not a good
combination for gold," he said. In the first quarter, jewelry demand for gold declined 25% and scrap supply
rose 55%, according to the World Gold Council.
UBS AG's metal strategist John Reade has a three-month target at $1,000, but warned of a short-term
retrenchment.
"It's all about dollar weakness," he said.
Speculative positions in Comex gold reached the highest level in a year, indicating that gold is vulnerable to
a change of sentiment, he said. At UBS, a major bullion bank, "physical buying of bars and coins has been
quiet in the last month or so," he added.
Another overhang is on the horizon. Congress is soon expected to approve the sales of 403.3 tons of gold by
the International Monetary Fund to help the world's poorest countries. The plan was announced in April and
tanked the gold market, despite the fund's pledge to sell over years and not to disrupt the market.
Big holders of U.S. debt, such as China and Russia, as well as oil exporter Venezuela, reported increases in
their gold holdings. These countries are likely to buy more gold to further diversify their foreign-exchange
reserves and hedge the exposure to the dollar. Individual investors have piled billions of dollars into gold
exchange-traded funds, which command thousands of tons of the metal.

James Steel, chief commodities analyst at HSBC, said it normally takes a year for the effects of stimulus
packages to show. "But," he said, "I think the market may not be that patient."

Australian Dollar Soars, Helped by Metal Demand

Australian Dollar Soars, Helped by Metal Demand

A rising global appetite for risk, optimism about China's recovery and a boost from Japanese investors are all
fueling a rally in the Australian dollar.
Since early February, the currency has risen about 28% against the U.S. dollar and 38% against the yen.
The New Zealand dollar, which often tracks the Australian dollar, has risen by similar amounts on both
currencies.
The Australian dollar is buoyed in part by the same wave of liquidity washing into other markets as central
banks in the world's major economies pump out money to restart growth. Another factor is bearish sentiment
toward the U.S. dollar that has pushed up other currencies.
Australia's dollar is an indirect beneficiary of the world's hopes for China, where signs have mounted that
government-led stimulus efforts are reversing a slowdown. Expectations of recovery in China, a major
consumer of energy and metals, have helped turn sentiment in commodity markets.
Copper and nickel have recently reached highs for the year, and gold is climbing toward $1,000 a troy ounce.
At $68.55 a barrel, Nymex crude oil is double its 2009 lows from February.
Australia is a major supplier of resources and commodities for China. "The Aussie dollar has leverage to
China through commodities," said Patrick Bennett, strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.
In the past, global market rallies have been led by an improved outlook for the U.S. and Europe, said Tomoko
Fujii, senior currency strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. Not so this time. "The importance
of China has increased in this cycle," she said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's decision announced earlier Tuesday to keep interest rates on hold at 3%
and a signal that rates could ease more checked some momentum in the currency.
On Wednesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Australia's average measure of gross
domestic product rose 0.4% in the first quarter of 2009 from the fourth quarter 2008 and rose 0.4% from the
year-earlier period. The data were higher than anticipated, reflecting stronger-than-expected trade numbers,
which could boost sentiment.
Late Tuesday in New York, the Australian dollar was trading at 82.14 U.S. cents, its highest level since
September and up from 81.09 cents late Monday. It sold at 78.48 yen Tuesday, up from 78.35 yen Monday.
On Feb. 2, the Australian dollar fetched about 56.67 yen and about 63.24 U.S. cents. New Zealand's dollar
was at 65.76 U.S. cents, up from 65.20 cents Monday and its highest level since October.
The Australian dollar's sharp rise against the yen suggests that a classic instance of the so-called carry trade,
in which investors borrow money in low-yielding currencies to invest in higher-yielding ones, may be back.
Ms. Fujii of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch noted that on Monday the yen dropped against all major
currencies. "This shows the yen's status as the No. 1 carry-trade currency," she said.
In the past, the carry trade was driven in part by hedge funds and other big players with access to easy credit,
but also by retail Japanese investors frustrated by Japan's near-zero interest rates. Many of those investors
are placing funds overseas again now that the yen has weakened somewhat and investors have grown a bit
more confident about the economy.
In April and May, the volume of margin trading of the Australian dollar-yen pair on the Tokyo Financial
Exchange's Click 365 market rose to levels not seen since last fall, after falling by nearly 80% in December.

Central Banks, Others
Were Selling Dollars
The dollar fell for a fourth straight session Tuesday as indications the global recession won't get worse led
central banks and others to sell U.S. currency they hold as reserves.
As the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, crude oil prices surged toward $70 a barrel and U.S. housing data
Tuesday proved encouraging, investors began betting against the U.S. currency and buying currencies that
may be deemed riskier but offer higher yields.
Tuesday afternoon, the euro was at $1.4321, up from $1.4158 late Monday, while the pound was at $1.6593,
up from $1.6443. The dollar was at 95.54 yen, down from 96.62 late Monday in New York, while the euro was
136.82 yen, above 136.79. The dollar was 1.0609 Swiss francs, up from 1.0705. ---

Black Swan Fund Makes A Big Bet On Inflation
Black Swan Fund Makes A Big Bet On Inflation

A hedge-fund firm that reaped huge rewards betting against the market last year is about to open a fund
premised on another wager: that the massive stimulus efforts of global governments will lead to
hyperinflation.
Universa Investments LP is known for its ties to investor Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the 2007 bestseller
"The Black Swan," which describes the impact of extreme events on the world and financial markets.
Funds run by Universa, which is managed and owned by Mr. Taleb's long-time collaborator Mark Spitznagel,
gained more than 100% last year. Universa now runs about $6 billion, up from the $300 million it began with
in January 2007.
While inflation isn't unimaginable, Universa's bet is that rising prices will reach levels few expect as
governments seek to goose their economies. The new strategy, designed by Mr. Spitznagel, aims to post big
gains if inflation and interest rates take off as they did in the 1970s.
Universa will invest in options tied to commodities such as corn, crude oil and copper, as well as options on
stocks such as oil drillers and gold miners.
"We think these things are going to see massive volatility," Mr. Taleb said in an interview.
The Black Swan Protection Protocol-Inflation fund will also bet against Treasury bonds, which tend to
weaken in inflationary environments. Last week, Treasury yields shot to their highest level since November as
prices fell on inflation concerns. Oil topped $66 a barrel. Gold is nearing $1,000 an ounce.
Mr. Taleb doesn't have an ownership interest in the Santa Monica, Calif., firm, but he has significant
investments in it and helps shape its strategies.
The term "black swan" alludes to the once-widespread belief that all swans are white. The notion was proven
false when European explorers discovered black swans in Australia. A black-swan event is something that is
extreme and highly unexpected.
As investors, Messrs. Spitznagel and Taleb have a mixed track record. They wound down their Empirica
Capital fund in 2004 after years of lackluster returns.
Also, some investors are worried not about inflation but about deflation and its effects were the economy to
remain stalled.

Investor Hopes for Rising Oil Demand Aren't Borne Out by Reality

Crude-oil prices are back on the march, hitting $65 a barrel last week as investors bet that a strengthening
economy will soon yield a rebound in oil consumption. But, so far, that looks like wishful thinking.
Although rising prices suggest that investors think otherwise, experts' demand forecasts are consistently
downbeat, and storage tanks are brimming with oil. Some industry experts worry that investors' bullish
sentiment could be self-defeating, driving prices so high that they squelch any nascent rebound in demand --
and possibly apply a brake to economic recovery.
Oil prices, which were less than $45 a barrel at the end of February, have jumped more than 45% in the past
three months. The rally reflects a range of factors: a weakening dollar, fears of inflation and increased
appetite for risk among investors. But the driving force appears to be the first glimmers of economic recovery.
Confident that an economic rebound will yield stronger demand for oil, investors are rushing to get ahead of
another surge in crude prices.
There have been some recent hints of firming demand. U.S. gasoline consumption has risen for two
consecutive weeks, according to the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. Chinese
crude-oil demand rose 3.9% in April over the previous year, according to Reuters. Ali Naimi, Saudi Arabia's
oil minister, said last week that an economic recovery was "under way" and predicted oil could hit $75 a
barrel by year's end.
But other indicators suggest recovery is still a long way off. Americans used less gasoline over the past four
weeks than they did in the same period a year ago, even though prices at the pump are $1.50 per gallon
cheaper on average. The International Energy Agency last month said global demand is at its weakest level
in two decades and predicted that world-wide consumption will fall 3% this year.
"If we look around the world, I don't think we see evidence of a pickup in demand," said Rachel Ziemba, an
energy analyst for RGE Monitor. She thinks rising Chinese demand may have more to do with the Chinese
government stockpiling oil than an increase in energy consumption.
Even when demand does rebound, huge stockpiles of oil should ease worries of a sudden supply crunch.
U.S. stores of crude are 16.5% higher than a year ago, even though imports are down 6.6%, based on a
four-week average. In all developed countries, there was enough oil in storage at the end of March to satisfy
62.4 days of demand, 14.7% more than a year earlier, according to the International Energy Agency.
Energy investors appear to be ignoring all the bearish supply and demand data and instead focusing on
"green shoots" in the economy, such as an uptick in consumer confidence, a slowing in the pace of job
losses, and a quickening of the pace of orders for durable goods.
The longer view of many analysts is that oil prices will rise when the healthy economy leads to robust global
demand that will outstrip supplies. Oil companies have warned that a prolonged period of low prices during
the recession could depress production for years, sowing the seeds of another rapid rise in prices once
demand rebounds.
But now that prices have bounced back relatively quickly -- oil last hit $65 in November on the way down from
a July high of $145.29 -- producers are striking a cautious note. Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson last
week warned that nobody knows yet whether the green shoots investors are betting on will have roots. "I
think it is still too early to call this economy," he said.
So far, higher gasoline prices haven't had much impact on American driving habits. Retail gasoline prices
rose 18.9% in May, to $2.44 a gallon on average, yet the auto club AAA still predicted a 1.5% increase in
Memorial Day driving over last year.

--- Page 63 ---
Page 63 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
That could change if gasoline goes much higher, especially with unemployment and tighter credit already
hurting consumer confidence. "Once you begin creeping toward $3 and above, it begins to have that
psychological impact and a real impact," said Joseph Stanislaw, an energy adviser for consulting firm Deloitte
LLP.
If rising energy prices eat into demand, or if the economy withers again, investors could pull money out of oil
just as quickly as they have poured it in, said Adam Sieminski, chief energy economist for Deutsche Bank.
That would push prices back down and start the cycle anew. Indeed, with fickle investor sentiment, not
slower-moving fundamentals, in the driver's seat, it's likely to be a long, volatile summer in the oil markets.

U.S. News: Biomass Power Generates Traction

While solar power is taking root in the sunny Southwest and wind power is growing in the blustery band from
the Dakotas to Texas, other places are turning to trees and grass as their best bet for producing renewable
energy, leading to a new building boom in "biomass" power plants.
Electric utilities may soon face new rules requiring them to generate 20% of their power from renewable
sources by 2020, according to terms in a bill to combat climate change being considered by the House of
Representatives. While the cost of generating solar and wind power is declining, making them increasingly
attractive options, not all places have enough wind or sunshine to make power generation practical.
The potential for government quotas is a major reason why electric utilities in the Southeast and parts of the
Midwest are now beginning to build industrial-scale plants that burn wood and other plant material -- or
"biomass." The utilities also stand to get significant federal tax credits for producing renewable energy.
Atlanta-based Southern Co. said it will build a $135 million biomass power plant. Progress Energy Inc.
recently agreed to buy power from a separate $135 million biomass power plant in Hartsville, S.C.
Oglethorpe Power Corp., a power cooperative based in the Atlanta suburbs, said in early May that it had
bought land to build at least two 100-megawatt biomass power plants, costing $400 million each. "In Georgia,
trees are plentiful," says Greg Jones, an Oglethorpe spokesman, "but wind is not abundant."
U.S. energy forecasters predict that by 2030, biomass will generate 4.5% of the kilowatts consumed in the
U.S., versus 2.5% for wind, with solar coming in behind both -- though all three will trail the more established
power sources of hydroelectric, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
Proposed policy that would put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions and provide tax credits and loan
guarantees for renewable energy is boosting the prospects for plant-based fuels. Another big reason for
biomass's growing popularity: it's dependable. When the wind doesn't blow, electricity utilities need to fire up
backup plants. But like coal, biomass can be continuously fed into a furnace to provide a steady flow of juice.
While greenhouse gas is released when biomass is burned, the process is considered nearly carbon neutral
because the plants only emit the carbon they absorbed while they were growing. The plants would release
the same amount of greenhouse gas if they died naturally and decomposed. The burning of coal, by contrast,
releases carbon that otherwise never would have been sent into the atmosphere.
Using nonfood crops to make cellulosic ethanol to fuel vehicles has been the most common path laid out by
Congress, but it may be more efficient to use those crops to make electricity. An acre of crops can generate
enough electricity for a battery-powered SUV to travel 15,000 miles, nearly twice the distance that would be
covered if the crops were turned into cellulosic ethanol, noted Elliott Campbell, an assistant professor of
engineering at the University of California, Merced, in a recent article in Science magazine.
Many of the new biomass power plants are using wood scraps left over from the region's timber industry, but
some companies are considering planting crops such as energy-rich grasses designed to be burned in power
plants. While the practice of burning biomass to generate power has been used in Scandinavia for decades,
growing crops specifically designed for biofuel is a new development.
That's the plan FirstEnergy Corp., Akron, Ohio, is pursuing in eastern Ohio. The company said in April it
would spend $200 million retrofitting two units of a coal plant to run on briquettes made of crops grown
specifically to burn in combustion boilers to make electricity.
The use of carbon-neutral fuel is important for utilities, because they may soon have to pay for some
greenhouse-gas emissions under the climate bill moving through Congress.

Many small investors are baffled about what to do next.
With the average U.S. diversified stock mutual fund topping 6% so far this year, but still down sharply over
the past 12 months, according to preliminary figures from Lipper Inc., is it time to move out of hiding places
like cash to join the rally? Or is it better to stay hunkered down with the expectation that this rally, like the one
late last year, will be followed by a steep decline?
Experts, too, are widely divided in their opinions about what's likely to happen next and how to prepare for it.
To find out what some of them are thinking -- and investing in -- we talked to the managers of two
top-performing "world allocation" funds, the $15 billion First Eagle Global and $12 billion Ivy Asset Strategy.
The funds rank in the top 20% of peers or better over the past three, five and 10 years, according to

We focused on these funds partly because world allocation funds have broad license to invest in stocks,
bonds and cash both in the U.S. and overseas, which means their managers have to be familiar with global
trends and opportunities, not just their home markets. We also singled these two out because their managers
have some opposing ideas. One conclusion most world-allocation managers are reaching, though, much to
the dismay of American investors, is the U.S. is generally not where growth opportunities lie for coming years.
Many world funds are instead focusing on places like Asia.
Here are edited excerpts from our conversations with the two management teams:
When do you see the U.S. economy, and stocks, recovering?
First Eagle co-Manager Matt McLennan says he sees rays of sunshine in U.S. manufacturing data that show
less deterioration in factory orders, and in the economic-stimulus efforts of various governments around the
world. Reduced oil prices have helped to hold up consumers' real disposable income relatively well in the
face of the grim labor market, he says.
Still, Mr. McLennan predicts a "tough environment for most of the companies we're watching in the U.S. for
the foreseeable horizon." He thinks that even if there is an economic recovery in 2010, it will likely be a weak
one.
"The fundamental echoes of this financial crisis will be deep and sustained," he says.
That said, he and fund co-Manager Abhay Deshpande think now is the time to buy stocks. The fund is 80%
invested in stocks currently, compared with 70% in typical times.
First Eagle is willing to invest heavily in stocks in the face of the fund's grim economic outlook because the
managers believe that the world's economies will certainly recover within the five-year horizon they use to
make investing decisions. While they aren't bullish on the U.S. generally, the few stocks they are focusing on
here, such as American Express Co. and Microsoft Corp., have been cutting labor and other costs and should
sport more-efficient operations when the world economy starts to grow again.
Mr. McLennan says he thinks the U.S. stock market has gotten ahead of itself recently and will remain
volatile. Still, "when things are uncertain, we're willing to invest in enterprise," he says, meaning companies in
which First Eagle has faith.
At Ivy Asset Strategy, co-Manager Ryan Caldwell says the team is banking on an economic recovery in 2010.
"We see corporate earnings bottoming in the second quarter of 2009, but no good growth trajectory will
appear until the second half of 2010." The Ivy team doesn't see U.S consumer activity picking up in a

meaningful way until then. Availability of cheap refinancing is easing but not erasing consumers' big debt
burdens, while job losses are continuing to take their toll.
The team's expectations are not that different from First Eagle's, but Ivy is building its portfolio much more
cautiously. It raised its stake in bonds to 13% from 10% in December, while steadily reducing its stock
exposure to 40% of assets, or about half as much as peers. The fund has 17% in gold bullion. The last time it
had so much was in 2006, when gold and gold-related stocks made up close to 30% of the fund. The
remaining 30% of the fund is in cash, which is considered very high.
The Ivy managers expect a flat U.S. stock market in coming months, citing weak prospects for earnings
growth and a financial system that remains pressured. They believe there will be ample time to find bargain
stocks. In the meantime, they are bullish on bonds.
What financial-market issue is creating the most debate among your fund's analysts and managers?
At Ivy, it is whether U.S. consumers will respond to the government's stimulus plan in a way that accelerates
recovery, or will they keep pulling back to lower their debt? It's a question of whether consumers will spend
more at, say, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., or on automobiles, says Ivy Asset Strategy co-Manager Michael Avery.
For now, the firm's analysts lean toward believing that consumers will continue to restrain spending in hopes
of paying off debt. Accordingly, the analysts expect recoveries to be muted in the U.S. and other developed
economies.
At First Eagle, the debate is over which is the bigger risk: near-term deflationary pressures or long-term
inflation. "Most commodities are down 50% year over year, labor costs are low and companies are at low
levels of capacity utilization," which all point to a sustained decrease in prices, says Mr. McLennan. On the
flip side, he notes, central banks and governments are keeping interest rates low and in some cases
increasing the money supply -- moves that tend to fuel inflation.
Hence, First Eagle is focusing mostly on foreign stocks that it thinks can perform well in either outcome, like
Nestle SA. As First Eagle sees it, the Swiss food conglomerate has a large and loyal customer base, which
gives it the ability to pass price increases for raw materials on to consumers. Meanwhile, low debt levels
should allow it to withstand price declines for its products in the next year should deflation take hold.
"If things get worse before they get better, we want companies that can survive through that," Mr. McLennan
says.
What are the best investment opportunities for the second half of 2009?
U.S. corporate bonds, both in the investment-grade and lower-quality junk areas, are a top opportunity this
year, say the Ivy managers.
Ivy's Mr. Caldwell has found investment-grade bonds promising since the collapse of investment bank
Lehman Brothers last September. From October through January, investment-grade "spreads" -- the yield
they pay above a comparable Treasury -- were about four times wider than normal. Those spreads have
tightened as credit markets have begun functioning better. But the Ivy managers still spot opportunities to
pick up what they think are underpriced bonds. Recent purchases include bonds yielding 7% that drug maker
Roche Holding Ltd. issued in March as it purchased Genentech Inc.
The Ivy managers think that defaults aren't a serious threat for selected junk bonds, and that these bonds
have been overly beaten down by such fears. This includes new junk bonds from Wynn Resorts Ltd. Junk
bonds issued by companies like this are selling at steep discounts, even though they can refinance debt in a
variety of ways, the Ivy managers say.
First Eagle, meanwhile, is bearish on most bonds. Mr. McLennan is staying away from junk bonds because
he expects a high frequency and severity of defaults. Nor does he find government bonds attractive.
"In a nutshell, stock-dividend yields around markets world-wide are in excess of 3%, and many government
bond yields are below 3%," he says.
Outside bonds, says Ivy's Mr. Caldwell, another top opportunity is China. It fits one of the fund's main
investing themes -- an "emerging middle class globally," he says. The fund's top stock holdings include
Chinese banks, life insurers and telecommunications companies.
One of its biggest holdings is Industrial &Commercial Bank of China, at 5% of the fund. The Chinese
government is by far the biggest stockholder in the bank, which provides a solid safety net, according to Mr.
Caldwell.

First Eagle, meanwhile, believes that, while China's economy is growing now, Japanese industrials will be
Asia's winners in sustainable expansion. Mr. McLennan says his fund likes such companies as
robotics-maker Fanuc Ltd. and factory-automation-parts producer Keyence Corp., both of which sell products
in the U.S. and Asia.
Mr. Caldwell agrees about growth prospects in Asia in general. Asian countries generally have little debt now,
he says. Their banks have excess savings and limited lending, which will let them generate faster growth
rates.
By contrast, he says, U.S. shares, when compared with those of companies in China, India and Southeast
Asia, have a flat earnings-growth trajectory.
Neither fund has much enthusiasm for most U.S. stocks. First Eagle's Mr. McLennan says he is staying away
from many U.S. companies because he finds them overvalued compared with those in Japan.
What danger zones do you see?
The managers of both funds agree that financial stocks hold little opportunity for investors despite their
seemingly dirt-cheap prices. They see banks as tough to value.
Ivy's Mr. Caldwell thinks that it is mainly U.S. banks that are troubled and that there is little incentive to wade
into these stocks now. He says the main issue is that raising cash to buttress their capital bases dilutes
existing shareholders, and that raising capital is expected to continue for a while, since U.S. government
"stress tests" in May revealed that a number of large U.S. banks need more outside money to remain
financially strong in the recession.
First Eagle's Mr. McLennan has stayed away from most financial stocks world-wide over the past 18 months.
The area accounts for about 2% of the fund, compared with 5% to 10% in other years.
"There's an element of speculation to buying these stocks," even at what seems like low prices, he says.
It isn't just dilution he fears. He is concerned that most banks remain highly leveraged compared with other
industries. He also worries that banks world-wide aren't showing sustainable improvement in their
businesses.
The few financial stocks he does own, like American Express, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Japanese
property-casualty company Aioi Insurance Co. Ltd., all have a common draw -- solid earnings before
provisions for loan losses, he says.

Dow Gained 4.1% For Month of May
Friday's Markets
Dow Gained 4.1% For Month of May

Risk is back in style.
Major indexes posted their third consecutive month of gains in May, led by stocks tied to emerging markets
and commodities. Treasury-bond yields rose for the second month in a row on increased risk-taking and
concern that the U.S. government's massive funding needs will push rates higher sooner rather than later.
That put pressure on the dollar, which fell, finishing at a five-month low against the euro.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged late Friday, ending up 96.53 points, or 1.1%, at 8500.33 and up
4.1% in May. Over the past three months, the Dow is up 20.4%, its biggest three-month gain since November
1998, and it has gained 29.8% from its March 9 bear-market low. The last time the Dow rose three months in
a row was October 2007, the month it hit its record close.
The Dow rose more than 100 points in the last hour of trading on Friday as investors decided to take money
off the sidelines and jump in.
Optimism about the global economic outlook has pushed commodity prices rapidly upward. Oil futures had
their biggest monthly percentage gain in a decade, up 29.7%, and settled Friday at the highest level since
November, at $66.31 a barrel.
The rally across multiple-asset classes reflects changing perceptions of the global economy as it emerges
from the depths of the financial crisis. Investors now are feeling giddy about the chance to make back money
lost in the downturn as economies show tentative signs of bottoming out.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.3% in May, for a three-month gain of 25%, its biggest
three-month gain since August 1938.
"We are getting more signs that the pieces are falling into place to deliver a recovery," says Bruce Kasman,
chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. But there are potholes in the road, he says, "$65 crude oil is a
problem." High gasoline prices mean "the consumer is getting hit by a purchasing power squeeze," he says.
Meanwhile, investor risk-taking is weighing on the dollar, which had served as a haven for worried investors.
Fears about inflation and U.S. deficits also helped send the dollar lower. In May, the greenback lost 6.4% of
its value against the euro. And after Friday's trading, in which the dollar fell against most major currencies, the
euro had more than regained its value against the dollar for the year to date. Late Friday, one euro bought
$1.4140.
Several analysts see the dollar decline nearing an end, as short-term traders pile on the bandwagon. "You
don't want to stand in front of a fast-moving train. You want to get on board instead," says Meg Browne,
currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. She says concerns about inflation and
foreign-government diversification away from dollar-denominated debt are overblown. "The market has gotten
ahead of itself," she says.
The sharpest gains against the dollar have been among currencies tied to commodities. Investors believe
China's recovering economy will suck up demand for energy and metals. The Canadian and Australian
dollars both rose more than 9% against the U.S. dollar in May.
Commodities themselves have skyrocketed as a bet on a return to economic growth and inflation worries.
Silver rose 26.8% in May, gold gained 9.9%. The DJ-UBS Commodity Index was up 13% in May, the biggest
monthly gain in percentage terms since 1991, when the calculations began.
The Treasury-bond market rebounded on Friday after a tumultuous week. The yield on the 10-year note
closed the month yielding 3.467%, up from 3.124% at the start of May. The yield hit 3.695% earlier in the

week, while the yield curve, or the difference in yield between the two-year Treasury note and the 10-year
note, reached its steepest point ever at 2.75 percentage points during the week. A steep yield curve can be
viewed as good for banks, which borrow cheaply in the short-term and lend at higher rates for longer periods.
Emerging markets, the most battered in the downturn, continue their comeback. India's stock market had its
best month since at least 1992, keying off election results that pleased investors. Bombay's Sensex 30 index
rose 28.3% in May. It is up nearly 52% this year and has now reached its highest closing value since Sept.
10, before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing roiled world markets.

Gold was the brilliant choice for analysts following metals and mining stocks last year. Investors flocked to
gold and the companies that mine it as a safe haven as the global economy and stock and credit markets all
tanked.
Sifting through stocks of gold producers propelled the rise of the No.1 analyst for the sector this year, David
Christie of Scotia Capital Inc. in Toronto, the investment-banking arm of Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr. Christie, a
46-year-old former geologist, says he concentrates his stock picking on four things: a company's
management team; the track record of the company's assets; its growth prospects; and whether the company
is well diversified.
Perhaps his timeliest call was on Iamgold Corp. Mr. Christie rated the Toronto-based stock a hold for all but
the last couple weeks of last year, avoiding its sharp decline. In mid-December, he raised his rating to buy,
capturing a return of more than 28% through year-end.
Mr. Christie had a buy on Toronto-based Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. for the first three months of the year, a
period that coincided with a return of more than 30%. He also scored with Kinross Gold Corp. of Toronto. He
upgraded the stock to buy in late-September, and the shares returned 11% through year-end.
His top pick for this year is Iamgold, which he says is finally showing some growth. "Management has some
very good people, and they have made some good acquisitions," he says. "They are one of the few
companies that showed improvement in cost-cutting." He says Iamgold has a strategy to grow smartly without
taking on too much debt.
The best call for the No.2 analyst, Steve Shepherd of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., in Johannesburg, South
Africa, was Johannesburg-based AngloGold-Ashanti Ltd. He called it a buy in November, and through
year-end the company's American depositary receipts returned nearly 50%.
Mr. Shepherd, 54, also scored a nearly 19% return by advising clients to buy the ADRs of Randgold
Resources Ltd. for the entire year. He says he liked Jersey-based Randgold because it is a fairly young
company with good growth potential.
Mike Jalonen, of Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch in Toronto, was the third-place finisher. He scored
with a buy on Vancouver-based Eldorado Gold Corp. in the last three months of 2008, earning a 72% return
through the end of the year, after a double-digit decline while he had it on hold.
Mr. Jalonen, who was with Merrill Lynch &Co. last year, before Bank of America Corp. bought it, also did well
with a buy rating on Royal Gold Inc. Although he prematurely downgraded it to sell in mid-October as shares
of the Denver-based company continued to rise, his buy rating from the beginning of the year until that shift
coincided with a return of more than 20%.
Mr. Jalonen, 49, says he remains bullish on gold in 2009 as spot prices flirt with the $1,000-an-ounce level
and safe-haven trading remains a key driver of the market.

Gold is likely to continue trading above $900 an ounce and could perhaps even challenge $1,000 again as
investors fret about the potential for inflation stemming from global economic-stimulus efforts and a softer
U.S. dollar, many analysts say.
The interest in gold comes even as buying of the metal as a safe investment has lessened. Stocks are well
up from March lows, and worries about the banking sector appear to have faded somewhat.
Still, "there are still plenty of problems out there, and I think you are going to continue to see flight to safety be
an important factor," said Bill O'Neill, one of the principals with Logic Advisors. He suggested that by
year-end, gold will again test $1,000, which it topped for the first time in 2008.
"Inflation seems to be an inevitable development," he said. "I think demand for hard assets will continue to
be strong, and gold will slowly but surely benefit from that."
May gold futures on Friday rose $7.70, or 0.8%, to $958.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest settlement price for a front-month contract since Feb. 25. The
price is up 8.5% this year.
Gold for June delivery, the most actively traded contract, rose $7.70, or 0.8%, to $958.90.
But before gold hits $1,000, it could dip below $900, some analysts say. Prices could head toward $800 as
seasonal weakness sets in from mid-June to the end of the summer, said CPM Group analyst Carlos
Sanchez.
Among the skeptics is Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management. He said he expects gold
to decline in the months ahead as the global economy remains soft, dismissing ideas that signs of growth
may be emerging in the economy. "In a deflationary recession," he said, "everything goes down."

Central Banks: First, Do No Harm?
Is the experimental medicine being dished out by central banks starting to have worrying side effects?
Using policies that would have been considered dangerously distorting and inflationary before the credit
crunch, the Fed and others have unleashed a torrent of liquidity that has helped lift global equities nearly 40%
from their March lows.
But other assets, like gold, the dollar and Treasurys, point to some unease with flood-the-zone central
banking. Central banks want to be in a position to print more money if economies stay weak, but their hands
may be tied if key markets react badly to their unorthodox responses. One fear is that all the easing could
lead to inflation.
Granted, credit markets have reacted well to the central-bank medicine. Yield premiums for the likes of
corporate bonds have narrowed from panic highs. And it is easy to make too much of recent weakness in the
dollar and Treasurys. At 3.42%, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is still below the 2008 average of 3.65%.
The greenback's recent decline against the euro merely takes it back to around where it started the year.
However, the speed with which both have sold off suggests that investors are beginning to take more
seriously the threats that have lurked in the background for many months. The first is that the U.S.
government's ballooning fiscal deficit will mean investors demand a higher yield on its debt. The second is
that printing too much money, through Fed programs, will debase the dollar.
The nightmare for central banks is if inflation expectations escalate. In that scenario, a sell-off could extend
to corporate bonds and stocks as investors start to price in tighter monetary policy.
One closely followed indicator shows inflation expectations are low. The difference between the yield on the
10-year inflation-protected Treasury and the regular 10-year Treasury suggests an annual rate of just 1.78%,
well below the 2.44% inflation rate this "spread" predicted on average from 2005 to 2007.
This apparent inflation insouciance might be warranted, given excess capacity in most developed economies
and caution among debt-laden consumers.
But the gold price, another inflation indicator, is showing surprising strength. That could reflect investor
mistrust in central banks' willingness to unwind reflationary policies if needed.
The last 20 years certainly have shown that central bankers find it extremely hard to engineer Goldilocks-type
outcomes. It is even harder right now for the Fed to calibrate correctly, because its response -- its balance
sheet has expanded by nearly $900 billion in the past year -- has been especially aggressive. The chance of
extreme outcomes has risen.
If Treasury yields do continue rising, it would hurt banks, housing markets and consumers, whose balance
sheets remain in poor shape.
Recent month-on-month inflation data in the U.S. shows prices have started rising. The increases are slight
so far. But if inflation breaks out, central bankers' recent medicine will be seen as quackery.

Hollywood Studios Need to Romance the Download
This industry drama is worthy of Hollywood.

Like music before it, and lately the book industry, major film studios are grappling with the transition from
distribution of physical DVDs to electronic delivery. It is a change the studios need to make, to cut costs and
curtail piracy.
Another benefit: regaining control of pricing. The studios let that genie out of the bottle with their decision to
use low prices to promote consumer purchases of DVDs, rather than keep the video business primarily rental
through high wholesale prices.
That worked for a while: Studio film revenues from video sales nearly tripled between 1997 and 2004 to $9.5
billion, boosting total film revenues 72%, estimates Adams Media Research. But DVD sales fell back to $8
billion last year.
Meanwhile, the downside of the low-pricing strategy is now evident. It allowed the emergence of Redbox,
which buys DVDs cheaply and uses vending machines to rent them for $1 a night and then sell some used
for $7. Its approach threatens the high-margin market for DVD sales, which despite its decline still accounted
for 43% of film revenues last year, as well as traditional rental rivals, which share their revenue with the
studios.
Because of the first-sale copyright law, which lets anyone resell or rent a DVD they have bought, there isn't
much Hollywood can do about Redbox, except embrace digital distribution and regain more control of the
product.
Already, the weekslong gap between release of a movie on DVD and for on-demand rental on cable-TV or
the Internet is shrinking -- or disappearing.
About 30% of major-studio movies released so far this year for on-demand viewing were available
simultaneously with the DVD release, up from 14% in 2007, according to In Demand Networks, a
cable-industry joint venture.
Studios get about 70% of the electronic rental price, more than what they get from DVD rentals. But worries
that simultaneous on-demand release could cannibalize more-valuable sales have caused studios to hold
back electronic release of megahits likely to sell well in DVD.
That strategy won't solve the Redbox problem. Another option: offering electronic purchase of movies before
the DVD release.
Services such as iTunes, Amazon and Vudu sell movies online at prices that deliver higher margins to the
studios than even physical sales, because there isn't any manufacturing involved.
For that strategy to work, the studios need to widen the array of services that offer electronic purchases, to
include cable TV, for instance.
Admittedly, the mass market won't transition away from DVDs for years. But by doing what they can to make
electronic delivery attractive, the studios can regain control of their product.

Mistakes Cost
British Air
A Bit of Lift
Times are tough for the airline industry. But British Airways' slump from record profit to record loss can't be
blamed solely on external factors.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh spoke Friday of the harshest business environment the company has ever
faced, while reporting a full-year pretax loss of GBP 401 million ($635.8 million). But some of BA's problems
are of its own making.
Operating problems at Heathrow's Terminal 5, when it opened last year, seriously damaged BA's reputation
and exacerbated a tough operating environment with intense competition for passengers.
BA's premium traffic fell 13% in the past six months as corporate-travel volumes declined.
As for costs, last summer's soaring fuel prices and the weakness of the British pound were unavoidable. But
British Airways also failed to reduce nonfuel costs in the fourth quarter even after exchange-rate fluctuations.

--- Page 77 ---
Page 77 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Limited progress on talks with cabin crews to reduce staff costs are a concern and threatened industrial
action by the unions would hurt passenger bookings.
Meanwhile, BA's proposed merger with Iberia is on hold due to poor business conditions and limited visibility
over costs and pensions. The GBP 1.7 billion hole in BA's pension fund is expected to deepen to as much as
GBP 3 billion at the next actuarial valuation later this year.
The one bit of good news is that fuel costs will fall significantly this year to about GBP 400 million. But that is
as far as it goes. BA has scrapped all other guidance and signaled there is more pain to come.
For that, the airline partly has itself to blame.

Overheard
Alan Greenspan was known for his cryptic comments about the economy. Not so his successor as Fed
chairman. At the Boston College School of Law on Friday, Ben Bernanke made it clear upfront that his words
wouldn't be worth parsing for clues about where the financial crisis will go next.
"I get a number of invitations to speak at commencements, which I find a bit puzzling. A practitioner, like me,
of the dismal science of economics -- and it is even more dismal than usual these days -- is not usually the
first choice for providing inspiration and uplift. I will do my best, though, and in that spirit I will take a more
personal perspective than usual in my remarks today. The business reporters should go get coffee or
something, because I am not going to say anything about the markets or monetary policy."
Pity those who made the trek to New England to avoid missing the latest Fed headlines.

Investors have been easy to please in the past two months. The global economy started getting worse at a
slower pace and the financial system avoided a meltdown, so they pushed up stocks more than 30%.
Now, investors are starting to ask for something more. They want signs that actual economic improvement is
coming. They didn't get anything like that last week, and they began selling stocks again.
"All we have now is 'less-worse' economic data, and that is a big step, but what we would like to see is
growth," said Marc Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, which manages about $50 billion in
New York. "For this rally to sustain itself, it can't simply be a matter of 'less-worse' forever."
The data last week were downright disappointing -- the opposite of what people had hoped to see. The
government reported that U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in April. Chinese industrial production rose
less than expected in April. Weekly U.S. jobless claims abruptly turned higher.
With stocks getting close to their highs for the year, investors cashed in some of their recent profits. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average fell 3.6% last week and the broad Standard &Poor's 500-stock index 5%. Those
were the sharpest declines since the week ended March 6, the week before the recent rally began.
On May 8, the S&P finished at 929.23, almost back to its 2009 high of 934.70, reached on Jan. 6. Since then
it has headed south.
The Dow remains down 42% from its 2007 record close and the S&P down 44%.
Credit Suisse warned clients to brace for a further pullback after the big gains. Its global equity strategist,
Andrew Garthwaite, published a report saying any stock recovery was more likely to look like a W than a V.
He urged clients to cut back on holdings of stocks tied to things like consumer spending, such as retailers,
and buy stocks of companies that are likely to have steadier sales, such as food producers.
New York research firm Strategas Research Partners was even more pessimistic. It warned clients that
economic performance could look more like a square-root sign: down, up and then sideways.
Much of the recent optimism was based on data suggesting that the pace of the economy's slide was slowing,
which was seen as a prelude to a recovery in the second half of this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke began predicting the recovery in public statements. But after last week's disappointments, investors
are looking for solid signs.
Mr. Stern at Bessemer monitors a series of leading indicators, including copper prices, surveys reflecting
what purchasing managers are seeing in their businesses, even Chinese electricity generation. Copper prices
and Chinese electricity production, which had been falling, have rebounded, which is a plus. Purchasing
managers' surveys world-wide are less bad, but still show most economies shrinking.
One of Mr. Stern's favorite indicators tracks exports by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to China. A few
months ago, those were falling at a frightening 40% annual rate. More recently, the rate of decline has
moderated to 20%.
For him to get really bullish, he "would need to see that get closer to zero," and, more broadly, he would want
to see purchasing managers globally show more optimism about new orders and hiring prospects.
In a normal world, Bessemer would put about 70% of clients' money in risky assets such as stocks and
less-than-top-quality corporate bonds. By last fall, just 50% of its holdings were in those risky areas, with the
other half in cash, gold and the safest government and corporate bonds.

Now, based on the early economic indicators, it has moved to a 60-40 balance, still more defensive than
normal. How much more Mr. Stern moves will depend on how serious future setbacks appear.
If there are signs that the credit system is weakening again, or that international trade is being threatened, he
could cut his stock exposure. If he sees signs of continued economic progress, he says, he will use market
pullbacks to boost stock holdings.
Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust, which manages about $522 billion in Chicago,
says he is looking for two things: evidence that the banking system is creating new loans without Federal aid,
and signs that economic improvement is more than a temporary blip.
His firm has boosted exposure to a limited group of risky investments, such as developing-country stocks,
junk bonds and commodities, which have been among the first to show gains.
"To get U.S. stocks to move ahead we need to have evidence that economic growth is going to benefit from
additional consumer spending and we also need signs that the credit markets are repairing," Mr. McDonald
said.
A lot of the recent stock gains were based simply on relief that the government prevented financial disaster,
adds Mark Freeman, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group, which manages $7.5 billion in Dallas.
"For the market to move higher, you have got to see corporate profits move higher instead of lower," he said.
For clients who hold a variety of investments, his firm actually cut its stock exposure in recent weeks,
anticipating the market pullback, Mr. Freeman said. The stocks that led the recent gains were simply those
that were bouncing off of panic lows, he said. Now, the trick will be to find companies that can actually show
sustained financial gains.
Because consumers are such a big part of the economy, he said, he will be looking especially closely now at
employment data and at consumer spending. Consumer spending was more resilient than expected in the
first quarter, but with Americans trying to boost savings now, "I wouldn't be surprised to see the consumer be
weaker in the second quarter," he said.
Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas in New York, shares Mr. Freeman's doubts about
consumers.
"We haven't identified a fundamental driver for economic expansion other than the government," Mr.
Bohnsack said. In the past decade, the economy's driver was consumer spending, averaging 71% of the
economy, compared with 66% over the past 40 years, he said. Now, he added, given falling home values,
consumer-credit troubles and job losses, consumer spending is more likely to fall back toward the 66% level.
Corporations, which are still facing tight credit conditions, are unlikely to pick up the slack any time soon.
"If corporations were having less trouble getting credit, you would expect companies to be paying lower rates,
but they aren't," he said. Recently, when Treasury-bond yields moved higher, so did interest rates most big
companies pay to borrow.
"As it stands now, the pace of economic improvement is idling somewhat," which helps explain the stock
market's uncertainty, he said.

GM Nears Crucial Deal With UAW --- Plan Would Halve Cash Outlays for Retiree Health, Pare Hourly Labor Costs by $1 Billion a Year
GM Nears Crucial Deal With UAW --- Plan Would Halve Cash Outlays for Retiree Health, Pare Hourly
Labor Costs by $1 Billion a Year

General Motors Corp., under the direction of the U.S. Treasury, is near a deal that would cut its hourly labor
costs by more than $1 billion a year and reduce its $20 billion pledge to the United Auto Workers to cover
health-care obligations, said people familiar with the matter.
The plan is still in flux, but GM and the union could finalize terms as early as next week.
The Detroit auto maker expects to halve its remaining cash outlays for retiree health costs to about $10
billion, and supplement that contribution with a 39% equity stake in the reorganized GM, the people familiar
with the matter said.
Cutting GM's health-care costs is an essential part of the "controlled bankruptcy" plan the Treasury
Department is formulating for GM.
GM declined to comment on the matter. A UAW spokesman couldn't be reached.
The proposed deal, which could still fall apart, would have to be approved by the UAW's 60,000 members at
GM, who are expected to face steep cuts in pay and benefits, as well as 20,000 additional layoffs.
By at least tentatively agreeing to the latest concession, the union -- which once prided itself on offering
members gold-plated benefits, job security and pay increases -- is taking another big hit in hopes of saving
the auto maker, which employed nearly 200,000 UAW workers just a decade ago.
In 2007, the UAW moved to protect one of its key benefits: health care for retirees. It did so by agreeing to
fund a new $35 billion health plan -- known as a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association -- that would
assume responsibility for retiree health-care costs starting in 2010.
The trust ended GM's exposure to health-care inflation by capping what it would pay in long-term health-care
costs. The cap meant the UAW would eventually need to cut coverage for hundreds of thousands of retirees
and their family members.
GM has already provided about $15 billion to the VEBA, but still owes $20 billion under an agreement that
would have let it fund the trust over time.
The original plan was viewed as the largest UAW concession in history. The idea was to help clear long-term
obligations off GM's balance sheet, and eliminate billions of dollars a year in cash outlays.
But the collapse of the U.S. auto market in 2008, and continued erosion of GM's market share, upended the
company's financial assumptions, and forced the parties back to the bargaining table. People involved in the
negotiations say the two sides have been able to approach an accord this time without the lengthy battles that
hampered previous negotiations.
Many worries remain for union officials, say people involved in the discussions. They say that the stock GM
proposes to contribute to the VEBA is illiquid and hard to value, posing a big risk for UAW members. The
union had initially asked for more from Treasury officials in the negotiations, but was rebuffed.
With UAW backing in sight, people inside the Treasury are increasingly confident they can push through a
massive reorganization of the auto maker, overriding protests from its bondholders and dealers. Some GM
bondholders are expected to argue in court that their interests are being trampled on, with their claims taking
a back seat to those of employees.

--- Page 83 ---
Page 83 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
A key element in the plan is the ability to execute what the Obama administration has dubbed a "quick rinse,"
which would place GM under bankruptcy protection and then remove its most valuable assets from court
oversight.
Treasury hopes to short-circuit protests from creditors by lining up deals before GM enters bankruptcy
proceedings. In coming days GM is expected to approach secured lenders, including major banks, to
renegotiate about $6 billion in debts, according to people familiar with the matter.
GM plans to ask its lenders for more time to pay its debt. It doesn't plan to ask for a significant reduction in
the amount of debt it owes, said people close to the discussions.
Another critical task for the auto maker will be to persuade a bankruptcy judge that unsecured bondholders --
owed at least $27 billion -- are being treated fairly in a reorganization. GM has offered them 10% of the
company's equity.
The bondholders, who say the offer is equivalent to four cents on the dollar, have fired back with a
counterproposal asking for 58% of the new GM's equity, and a bigger slice than the UAW's. But
administration officials, emboldened by concessions wrested from Chrysler LLC's lenders, are taking a hard
line, according to people close to the Treasury.
These people say the Obama administration wants a GM bankruptcy "to be as clean as possible," but isn't
"going to pay ransom to bondholders."
A steering committee representing the bondholders has had trouble persuading the administration's
automotive task force to sweeten terms of a debt-for-equity swap, people attending the meetings said.
The steering committee and other bondholders expect to raise legal objections to GM's bankruptcy plan if it
doesn't change the current offer, said Eric Siegert, managing director at Houlihan Lokey, which represents
the steering committee.
The key to overriding bondholder challenges is whether the government can persuade a bankruptcy judge
that GM is on the brink of collapse. This is known as a "melting ice cube" argument, and is often used to
justify what is called a "363 sale" in bankruptcy parlance, or the immediate sale of assets whose value would
likely be destroyed by a stay in bankruptcy court.
GM's bankruptcy attorneys expect to point to recent developments at Chrysler, where sales fell 48% in the
month leading up to its April 30 bankruptcy filing, as evidence that GM's revenue base is akin to a melting ice
cube because consumers aren't interested in buying cars from a bankrupt company, according to people
working on the plan.
In a regulatory filing late Thursday, GM confirmed that it plans to sell assets to a new operating company and
liquidate its remaining assets if it files for bankruptcy. The new company is expected to include brands like
Chevrolet and Cadillac, and plants needed to make those products. Plants and divisions slated for closure
would be sold or liquidated.
GM also told its suppliers it will make critical payments to them nearly a week before a Treasury-imposed
deadline for an out-of-court restructuring. GM spokesman Dan Flores said GM will make the payments on
May 28, instead of June 2, partly to support struggling car-parts makers.

Geithner's Revelation of the Obvious Provokes Response

Finally, according to your editorial "Geithner's Revelation" (May 12), the Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has
recently acknowledged the role the Federal Reserve has played in keeping monetary policy "too loose too
long." Eureka! Or maybe it's Catharsis! But better to acknowledge responsibility late than never, and now that
Mr. Geithner has come to grips with the Fed's, perhaps he can move on to accountability. This would make
the rest of us feel better, too.
I hope that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Mr. Geithner will offer a tip o' the hat to the country's savers,
most of whom, I dare say, are seniors who have been forced for the past 18 to 24 months to sacrifice income
and their standard of living to a steeper yield curve and bank profitability.
Of course, by the time the Treasury starts paying a realistic rate of interest on the term structure of its
borrowings, and the Fed clears itself of the trillion-plus dollars of toxic guarantees on its balance sheet, we
may have an economy mummified by government debt. This could likely result in restored senior income
being whisked away again, this time by increased taxes.
The only heroes in this monumental fiasco are the ordinary citizens of America who are suffering through it.

The realization that gold's price hasn't changed in four millennia would be a true sign of progress for the brain
trust that controls the amount of U.S. currency in our world.
All the gold that has been mined in history is still in existence today; it doesn't get used up. Gold is rare. The
world's supply of gold would fill the Washington Monument only a third of the way up. There is little or no
industrial usage for gold, and economic conditions don't change its price.
Gold acts as the only accurate forward barometer of what our currency is worth, a Polaris of money. To
ignore its movements will beget in any society the dislocation that comes with a significant decline of the
monetary standard.
As George Bernard Shaw said, "You have to choose [as a voter] between trusting to the natural stability of
gold and the natural stability of the honesty and intelligence of members of the government. And with due
respect to these gentlemen, I advise you, as long as the capitalistic system lasts, to vote for gold."

To blame the Fed's monetary policy from 2003 to 2005 for "creating the mess" is simply wrong.
The Economist (Jan. 24) has it right: "The deep causes of the financial crisis lie in global imbalances --
mainly, America's huge current account deficit and China's huge surplus."
If a country's national saving, which is the sum of public saving and private saving, is less than its domestic
investment, which is the sum of private domestic investment and public investment, it runs a current account
deficit and a capital account surplus.

--- Page 86 ---
Page 86 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
When a country runs a current account deficit it must incur liabilities, that is, borrow or run down its foreign
assets, or do both.
From the first quarter of 2000 to the third quarter of 2006, the U.S. current account deficit increased from
$362.8 billion to $825.6 billion on an annual basis, or an increase of $462.8 billion. Over the same time frame,
the federal government's fiscal position swung from surplus to deficit by $411.1 billion on an annual basis.
Consequently, 88.8% of the increase in the U.S. current account deficit, which led to the global imbalances,
was caused by the deterioration in the federal government's fiscal position.

Risk in Market's One-Track Mind
Bears dismiss the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel as an oncoming train.
If only: U.S. railroad freight traffic is running about a fifth lower than a year ago. It is one of several
less-obvious indicators that all isn't well, despite the financial-market rally since early March.
The slump in weekly rail traffic reflects sluggish industrial activity and consumption. Shipments of industrial
products are down almost a third in the past year, while raw materials like coal, metals and crops also show
steep drops. The pace of decline has picked up relative to the first quarter's 16% fall, according to Credit
Suisse analyst Chris Ceraso.
In commodities, while crude oil and copper have been on a tear, prices for lumber and natural gas remain
depressed. Lumber is exposed to construction and has been in a bear market since 2004, so it might be
regarded as a special case. Still, there is little sign of a rebound.
Natural-gas prices, meanwhile, are perhaps half the marginal cost of production. Such weakness reflects a
glut of natural gas, exacerbated by falling electricity demand, down 6% in March. That can't be put down
merely to quiet building sites.
Companies' spending plans also sit oddly with this rally. Analysts are predicting a strong rebound in earnings
next year. Jefferies &Co. said analysts also are predicting cuts to capital expenditure as a proportion of
revenue and relatively flat earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margins in 2009 and
2010. Unless productivity rises sharply, boosting revenue, that doesn't add up.
As companies try to protect profits, the losers will be employees. Carl Riccadonna, an economist at Deutsche
Bank, calculates that wages and benefits accounted for 68% of U.S. household income over the past 10
years. With other forms of income, particularly gains on assets, flat or in reverse, rising employment income
will be critical to fostering a real recovery. April's headline payroll number, skewed by government hiring,
obscured big declines across industry sectors, as well as falling temporary hires, a leading indicator in the
labor market. Hourly earnings growth slowed, year on year.
In addition, more than two-thirds of the 3.3% year-on-year increase in aggregate disposable personal income
in the first quarter came in the form of lower tax payments. Washington is similarly providing a crutch in the
form of quantitative easing, helping homeowners refinance at cheaper rates.
Against this, lending conditions remain tight. Moreover, the threat of unemployment limits demand for credit,
as demonstrated by the rising savings rate. Overall, spending power is leaching out of the economy even as
funds desperate not to miss out on "the turn" pump money into riskier asset classes. Another old bearish saw,
about selling in May and going away, is looking apposite.
-- Liam Denning
Ford Makes a Quick Pit Stop
Ford Motor is weaving through the roadblocks with reasonable aplomb.
Its latest move to issue $1.4 billion of new stock makes good use of the almost fourfold share-price jump
since February. Between 2009 and 2011, Ford must contribute $3.9 billion to an employee trust. Half can be
in stock, at fixed prices of between $2.00 and $2.20 a share, which implies issuing as many as 930 million
shares. By selling stock at $4.75 Tuesday -- albeit a steep discount to the price at announcement -- Ford
covered most of that liability by issuing 300 million shares instead.

--- Page 88 ---
Page 88 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson reckons Ford's vehicle business can make $8 billion of earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in a normal year. Put a five times multiple on that, add
$10 billion for the Ford credit business, and it gives an enterprise value of $50 billion.
Subtracting potential share-issue proceeds and cash over and above what Ford will likely burn through by the
end of 2010 leaves net debt and employee-trust obligations of about $34 billion. Implied equity is under $5 a
share.
Rough math, but the sensitivity to assumptions about long-term earnings power is clear. Buyers must believe
Ford's equity issuance bridges the gap until better times allow it to service sizable obligations from operating
cash flow.
If you bought Ford at under $2 a share, you might regard buying new stock as an acceptable cost to protect
against risks of bankruptcy or Washington interference. Above all, it is a bet on management's extreme
driving skills. It has done well to date. But, as the heavy discount investors demanded demonstrates, there is
a long road ahead.
-- Liam Denning
China Cracks Open the Vault
Good news for banks is rare these days. Easy access to China even scarcer. Hong Kong's banks just got a
bit of both.
Two recent moves offer particular hope: the decision to grant Hong Kong banks more leeway to set up
branches in the province of Guangdong and an expected pilot program allowing the settlement of
cross-border trade with China in Hong Kong, in yuan.
Banks like HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered, already well-placed in China, could be big gainers.
Meanwhile, the potential benefit for smaller Hong Kong banks, like Wing Hang Bank, Bank of East Asia or
Hang Seng Bank, will be noted by potential suitors looking for Asian expansion.
As is often the case with new initiatives in China, uncertainty lingers. For example, just how quickly will Hong
Kong banks be able to take significant market share? Similarly hazy is how profitable trade settlement in yuan
will be.
What is clear is the potential. In Guangdong, home to populous cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou, a lot is
at stake. Goldman Sachs estimates the province's deposit base at about $800 billion, already more than in
Hong Kong itself. On the foreign-exchange front, trade flows between Hong Kong and China were nearly
$360 billion last year.
Either is potentially a sizable reward for having survived the credit crunch.
-- Andrew Peaple
Hedge Funds'
Unshaken
Faith in Gold
Some hedge funds remain dazzled by gold. And the yellow metal's resilience during a rally in riskier assets
suggests their bet might yet pan out.
A who's who on Wall Street piled into gold-related investments over recent months. Paulson &Co., Greenlight
Capital, Eton Park Capital Management, Hayman Advisors, Blue Ridge Capital Holdings and Highfields
Capital Management were among those buying gold futures, shares of gold producers and even physical
gold.
Some sought safety, in anticipation of deeper economic dislocation. But more became concerned that
governments would cripple some major currencies and potentially spark a burst of inflation, by shoveling
buckets full of money at troubled areas.
Instead, other markets have leapt as investors sniff an economic recovery, reducing the need for gold as a
haven. Some hedge funds, such as Daniel Loeb's Third Point, have bailed on gold, but more are digging in.
Fund-of-fund investors estimate that 5% or more of hedge-fund assets are in gold-related investments. John
Paulson; Kyle Bass, who runs Hayman; and David Einhorn, of Greenlight, are among those who recently told
investors that they remain convinced the trade will work. John Burbank, who runs Passport Capital, wrote to

investors, listing various reasons his firm has 9% of its money in gold, including a prediction that China will
continue buying.
The conviction: That it was easier for central banks to let the monetary genie out of their collective bottles
than it will be to put back in. The risk: That the trade, with gold above $900 an ounce, already has become
too crowded.

Should Sergio Marchionne feel flattered or furious? The Fiat chief executive's turbocharged deal making has
spawned a spoof Dow Jones Newswires report, doing the rounds on email, claiming that he wants to buy
Switzerland.
Apparently, it would be a great way to rationalize a surfeit of brands and capacity, both for the car industry
and Europe.
He hopes to line up government money for his plan to fuse Fiat, Chrysler and General Motors' Opel business.
The "article" is silent on whether he would expect taxpayers to back his Alpine run.

Stocks Finish Mixed, While Oil Touches $60

Stocks Finish Mixed, While Oil Touches $60

Stocks ended the day mixed as the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed into positive ground with gains in
drug and oil stocks, while industrials and financials lagged behind, weighing on other indexes.
The Dow gained 50.34 points, or 0.6%, to close at 8469.11, pushed up by a 5.5% gain for Pfizer and a 2.4%
gain for Merck. Pharmaceuticals are traditionally considered defensive stocks in tough economic times.
Chevron and Exxon Mobil also rose as crude-oil futures settled slightly higher, after hitting $60 a barrel during
the day for the first time in six months.
Declines among bank stocks and a drop in industrial shares amid the fear of a possible bankruptcy filing by
General Motors kept pressure on the S&P 500-stock index, which slipped 0.89 point to end at 908.35, a 0.1%
dip. The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite index also finished lower.
GM dropped 20% to $1.15, its lowest closing price since April 27, 1933, according to the Center for Research
in Security Prices at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
Oil futures ended the day up 0.6% at $58.85 a barrel, the highest settlement price since Nov. 11. Treasury
prices rose, while the dollar declined.
Gold futures, traditionally considered a hedge against inflation and other economic pitfalls, rose $10.50 to
$923.50 an ounce.
Investors remain concerned that the recent rally in stocks may lead to a pullback in the short term. Few think
stocks are likely to return to levels last seen in early March, but the rapid turnaround led many to change their
strategies quickly, with some going more defensive on Tuesday.
"Whenever you have a significant directional change, it causes managers to pick up the turnover a little bit,"
said Gerry Sparrow, president and chief investment officer for St. Louis-based Sparrow Capital Management.
The financial sector of the S&P 500, which led the market higher in the recent rally, was down 2%. Bank of
America and Citigroup both fell more than 5%. Bank of New York Mellon was the latest bank to sell stock,
raising $1.2 billion in a follow-on offering. Its shares slipped 3.8%.

Fool's Gold
By Gillian Tett
(Free Press, 293 pages, $26)
Gillian Tett's "Fool's Gold" concerns the financial meltdown of 2008, but it has the feel of a United Nations
climate report in which the scientists gather the facts and the politicians write the executive summary. The
book's subtitle blames "Wall Street greed" for the credit disaster. The preface begins by asking: "Were the
bankers mad? Were they evil? Or were they simply grotesquely greedy?" At the end, Ms. Tett sums up the
history that led to the crisis: "For five long decades, American finance had worshiped at the altar of
free-market ideals."
Ironically, Ms. Tett's reporting describes not an out-of-control free market but one tragically distorted by
government regulation. If she struggles to reach a logical conclusion, then, she still does an excellent job of
assembling the facts necessary to form one. Her clear and simple accounts of complicated financial
instruments are superb. Other than her claim that American International Group Inc. was in danger of losing
its AAA credit rating in the fall of 2008 -- more than three years after AIG had lost it -- her research appears to
be solid and comprehensive.
Ms. Tett, it is clear, looks kindly on the prospect of more regulation, particularly of credit-default swaps (CDS),
but her diligent reporting may well convince readers that such derivatives have received too much blame for
the crisis. Essentially a form of insurance against the possibility that loans will not be repaid, credit- default
swaps were created to allow banks to reduce their risk by paying premiums to investors willing to bear the
risk themselves. Once the banks had insured certain loans on their books, they could make more loans with
their available capital.
Ms. Tett, who has a doctorate in social anthropology, explores the pioneering days of the CDS market at J.P.
Morgan in the early 1990s and discovers a tribe of bankers who were not mad, evil or grotesquely greedy.
Their culture, she notes, was a meritocracy; talent was rewarded regardless of race, sex or social pedigree.
The tribe's leader, the cerebral Peter Hancock, made certain that compensation was tied to Morgan's
long-term success. The Morgan derivatives team, though paid less than employees at rival firms, enjoyed the
intellectual challenge of solving financial problems. They developed complicated models to predict
loan-default rates and never believed that the models were infallible.
This tribe also maintained the old-fashioned ethics of good banking. Ms. Tett reports that before Orange
County, Calif., made the derivatives bets with Merrill Lynch that bankrupted the county in 1994, Orange had
approached J.P. Morgan. William Demchak, then a Morgan salesman and now the senior vice chairman of
PNC Financial Services Group, met with the county's treasurer and discovered that the official didn't
understand derivatives. Mr. Demchak could have collected large fees anyway, but instead he urged
colleagues: "Under no circumstances should we deal with this client!"
In late 1997, Morgan set up an investment vehicle that would prove a watershed. It allowed investors to sell
insurance to Morgan on a pool of the bank's loans, offering competitive returns and reasonable risk because
Morgan was known for its careful underwriting and for loaning money only to blue-chip companies. For
Morgan, the vehicled offered affordable insurance against the possibility that some of its corporate clients
wouldn't pay their bills. More technically, the vehicle sold credit- default swaps to Morgan and collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs) to investors. The structure made sense. Soon, Morgan was creating such deals for
other banks.
But the Morgan team generally avoided applying this approach to the mortgage market; the team didn't think
that there were enough data available to calculate default rates and responsibly price the insurance. The

country had not seen a serious nationwide housing downturn since the 1930s, and records from that period
were scarce or unreliable. For decades, the national housing market had gone in only one direction: up. The
Morgan team didn't want to guess what a real housing bust would look like.
Others in the banking industry would be less careful and less smart. Greed might have driven them to expand
their use of the new financial tools, but let's be clear: The disaster that followed could not have occurred
without regulation. As Ms. Tett notes: "Most investors had no idea how the banks were crafting their models
and didn't have the mathematical expertise to evaluate them anyway." Instead, writes Ms. Tett, "investors
generally relied on the ratings agencies to guide them through this strange new land." Anointed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, the major ratings agencies slapped their
triple-A seals of approval on thousands of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs. "Such blessings, after all,
made the whole system work: the AAA anointment enabled [structured investment vehicles] to raise funds,
banks to extend loans, and investors to purchase complex instruments that paid great returns, all without
anyone worrying too much," Ms. Tett writes.
Even for bankers who wanted to exercise their own judgment about credit risk, it wasn't easy to ignore the
government-selected credit ratings. That's because the ratings were embedded in the Basel banking
standards mandated by the Fed and other central banks around the world. Bank assets were measured by
credit ratings, and the Basel standards gave banks better scores for holding AAA-rated securities backed by
mortgages than for making individual loans to even the most creditworthy businesses.
The Basel rules had other problems, encouraging banks to keep risks off their balance sheets even while the
banks remained liable for them. Called to a 2007 meeting in Washington to discuss the dangers posed by
unregulated hedge funds, fund manager James Chanos tried to explain the problem. He told the assembled
bureaucrats: "It is the regulated bits of the system you should worry about!" To this day, it remains excellent
advice.

Stars Aligned for Movie Deals
Is it time for movie-studio executives to get cosier with their colleagues?
The sharp drop in DVD sales in recent months, heralding the possible exhaustion of a long-running gold
mine for film, has prompted studios such as Walt Disney to look for ways to cut costs.
The fastest way to do that is to team up with another studio.
Time Warner, for instance, saved $140 million annually by combining New Line and Warner Bros.
The music industry has shown the way. Faced with a piracy-fueled collapse in sales, six majors controlling
more than 80% of the U.S. market in 1997 shrank to four today through mergers. Three of those four --
Warner, Sony and Universal Music -- had 78% of the market for the year to date, according to Nielsen
SoundScan.
The mergers haven't only helped cut costs. Fewer record labels mean major releases face less competition
for radio airtime and consumer attention.
The film-industry market share, whether based on box-office revenue or home video, is roughly as
fragmented as the music industry was preconsolidation. While market leaders such as Warner have close to
20%, laggards such as General Electric's Universal Studios and Sony are nearer 10% to 12%.
Of course, film and music aren't the same. For one thing, film revenues aren't falling off a cliff. Theatrical box
office is up this year, and it isn't yet certain DVD sales are in a terminal decline.
Still, piracy is likely to grow as a problem in film, as it did in music. And studios would be hurt even if DVD
sales growth turned flat long term.
After doubling between 1998 and 2008, DVD sales accounted for 43% of total feature-film revenue last year,
Hollywood's largest single revenue source, according to Adams Media Research. Adams projects a decline of
8% in DVD sales this year after a 9% drop last year.
In addition, there is little credence given any more to the vertical-integration theory that drove a spate of
mergers in the 1990s, putting various television networks and studios under the same roof. Networks have to
broadcast the best product for their audience, rather than only what they produce.
Even if entertainment companies don't want to sell their studios outright, they could get cost-saving benefits
by partnering on some back-office functions, such as home video or theatrical distribution.
Studios have worked together before in those areas, most notably in international film distribution.
Joining forces in, say, home video could save tens of millions of dollars for studios -- adding theatrical
distribution could sharply increase those savings.
Whatever happens, there is an advantage to moving first. Once two studios team up, subsequent deals will
likely get more antitrust scrutiny, just as occurred in the music industry.
Working together won't necessarily lead to bigger combinations immediately -- but it would get the ball rolling.
-- Martin Peers
Governments Should Be Wary of Playing the Yield on Bonds

--- Page 94 ---
Page 94 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Here is a conundrum: Given the unprecedented quantities of government debt due to be issued over the
coming years, why are yields still so low? Sure, U.S. and U.K. government bond yields have risen in recent
weeks, but they are still low by historic standards. Do the laws of supply and demand not apply?
The market's apparent insouciance over this debt splurge stems from two underlying assumptions, both
questionable. First, that demand will expand to meet supply. Second, that government bond yields are
determined by interest rate and inflation expectations, regardless of supply and demand.
Historically this may be true. Since the crisis started, government borrowing has ballooned and risk aversion
has fueled demand. But even policy makers doubt that can last. A year ago, the U.K. Debt Management
Office was warning the Treasury that it thought it would struggle to sell more than GBP 100 billion ($150.7
billion) of U.K. government bonds, or gilts. It managed to sell GBP 140 billion. But this year, it must sell GBP
220 billion.
Meanwhile, recent events demonstrate that interest-rate assumptions alone don't determine yields. U.K. gilt
yields seesawed Thursday either side of the Bank of England's announcement that it will spend a further GBP
50 billion buying gilts. Indeed, the BOE has explicitly stated one of its aims is to drive down yields --
impossible if supply and demand has no impact.
Government bond markets are the largest and most liquid in the world. In theory, if prices deviated for too
long from the level implied by the discounted value of future cash flows, arbitragers would exploit the
opportunity. Yet this hasn't been happening in the U.K. The spread between long-term swap rates -- a market
measure of long-term interest rate expectations -- and gilts of similar maturities has turned sharply negative.
In a properly functioning market, it should be slightly positive.
The BOE has provided various possible explanations for this, including the unavailability of credit for
arbitragers, fears over counterparty risk and mark-to-market risks. But the most compelling reason is
so-called Knightian uncertainty: risks that can't be measured. High among these: the likelihood that
government borrowing will exceed even bloated estimates and that demand will be insufficient at prices that
reflect future interest rate expectations.
The implications could be profound. Even triple-A credits such as the U.S. and U.K. may find that they can't
borrow without limit at prices that reflect future interest rate expectations. Instead, yield curves will steepen
further, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy. All the more reason for governments to get their
borrowing under control.

Goldman
Test Stresses
Rival Morgan
Why did the stress tests treat Goldman Sachs Group better than Morgan Stanley?
In the worst-case scenario used to determine bank capital needs, the government posits that Goldman might
be 2 1/2 times as profitable as its main rival this year and next.
In the period, the Treasury and bank regulators are saying Goldman will have $18.5 billion in "resources other
than capital to absorb losses." This number primarily reflects how much in earnings, excluding provisions and
securities marks, a bank can generate. For Morgan Stanley, the government has a much lower $7.1 billion.
As a result of Thursday's stress test, Morgan Stanley raised $4 billion in common stock. That shareholder
dilution mightn't have been needed if the authorities had come up with stronger earnings generation for
Morgan.
Were the tests' assumptions "stacked in Goldman Sachs's favor?" asks Michael Hecht at JMP Securities. He
notes that the $7.1 billion for Morgan is 62% below Goldman's figure, whereas Morgan's reported net revenue
has, on average, been only 22% below Goldman's over the past five years.
The government documents don't give enough detail to explain the gap. One has to hope that the testers
weren't placing too much emphasis on Goldman's strong outperformance in the first quarter, when Morgan's
revenue was 68% lower -- partly because it reined in risk.
Few would argue that Goldman isn't the stronger of the two, and the government may have its Goldman
projections right. But the numbers appear to bake in the idea that Goldman is savvier at making money from
taking risk. The U.S. had better be right.

Overheard
Fifth Third comes first. The day after government stress-test results, the Cincinnati bank's stock rocketed
nearly 60%, leaving rivals in the dust. It has rallied over 700% from February's low. Once envied for its
preternaturally low expenses, the bank stumbled on high real-estate losses, making it one of the most
spectacular boom-bust banks of the credit crunch. The stock's saying it could yet turn into a boom-bust-boom.

Among the glitterati descending on Washington for Saturday's White House Correspondents Dinner we hear
is George Osborne, the British Conservative party's economics spokesman. His host? Michael Bloomberg.
Overheard can't help wondering, given Britain's perilous fiscal state, whether the man likely to be running the
U.K. Exchequer next year might be hoping to persuade the plutocratic New York City mayor to help fill the
gaping hole in the public finances.

World News: Rivals in Iran's Election Take Aim at Ahmadinejad
World News: Rivals in Iran's Election Take Aim at Ahmadinejad

TEHRAN, Iran -- The three major challengers to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June presidential
elections hail from different political backgrounds but share a common view: If Mr. Ahmadinejad is re-elected,
he will lead Iran toward disaster.
As campaigning has kicked off, they have sharply criticized Mr. Ahmadinejad. While they broadly support
Iranian policies such as pursuing a nuclear program and refusing to recognize Israel as a state, they seek to
distance themselves from Mr. Ahmadinejad's tough-talking style.
"If Ahmadinejad's path continues, we are heading for the edge of the cliff," Mohsen Rezaei, a hard-line
conservative and former head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, said at a press conference on Sunday. Mr.
Rezaei, who announced his candidacy last week, said he favors a foreign policy that best serves the national
interests of Iran, not one that is "provocative" and "adventurous."
Mr. Rezaei's strong words underscore the deep divisions within Iran's conservative establishment, who favor
ideological politics, on whether to support Mr. Ahmadinejad's bid for four more years in office.
The president hasn't officially announced his candidacy, but he has set up a campaign team and his advisers
routinely make comments that suggest he will run.
Iran this week began registering candidates for the Islamic Republic's June 12 election. But it's already clear
that four major contenders will emerge with the backing of political groups and the country's leadership.
In addition to the conservative Mr.Rezaei, two others have announced campaigns, both "reformists" who lean
toward greater social freedom and flexibility: Mir Hossein Mousavi, prime minister in the 1980s, and Mehdi
Karroubi, a cleric who served as speaker of parliament in the early 2000s.
Iranians elect their president for four years, with a maximum of two terms.
The election is deemed the most important political event in the region this year as the country's influence
rises -- particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the U.S. is seeking stability and cooperation from
neighboring states.
Iran's broader policies, such as its standoff with the West over its nuclear program and talks with the U.S.,
won't likely change with a new president because Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final word
on all state matters. Under Iran's constitution, the appointed senior cleric oversees the judiciary, armed forces
and broadcast media.
However, analysts say the president remains the public face of Iran, and whomever Iranians elect in June will
affect the country's international standing.
"The overall policies of the government will remain the same, but a different president can determine the way
these policies are discussed and acted out," says Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, a political analyst in Tehran.
Mr. Ahmadinejad has a good chance of being re-elected because of his popularity with rural voters as well as
the urban poor and middle class. But if the less-conservative rivals can strike a chord among urban voters,
that could lead to a tighter race.
With his folksy banter and tough talk about the West, Mr. Ahmadinejad draws big crowds in the provinces. His
critics complain that he is using state funds for his campaign travel. Local newspapers have reported that his
government has distributed 400,000 tons of potatoes and doled out cash and gold-coin bonuses.
Mr. Ahmadinejad has addressed these allegations by saying he is sharing the country's wealth among
citizens.

--- Page 97 ---
Page 97 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The state-owned radio and television networks openly back the president. To compete, his rivals are using
novel campaigning techniques, such as sms text messages, Web sites, and DVDs.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's rivals are banking on the public's dissatisfaction with the economy. Unemployment and
inflation have soared despite record-high oil revenues during Mr. Ahmadinejad's tenure.
Mr. Rezaei's candidacy could splinter Mr. Ahmadinejad's votes among the rank-and-file of security forces as
well as conservatives who are unhappy about the government's performance.
Mr. Karroubi has vowed to get rid of the morality police taskforce, work toward equal rights for women, and
free political prisoners. Drawing a distinction with Mr. Ahmadinejad, who has denied the Holocaust, Mr.
Karroubi said last week that "the Holocaust is a fact. Whether the number of people who perished is six
million or 6,000, denying it is of no benefit to Iran."
Mr. Mousavi is viewed by many as Mr. Ahmadinejad's most serious competition. Backers include Mohammad
Khatami, who as president from 1997 to 2005 pushed to reform the system and open Iran to the world. Mr.
Khatami initially entered the race but withdrew to avoid taking away votes from Mr. Mousavi.
At a rally of several thousand university students, Mr. Mousavi said Mr. Ahmadinejad's government has
created such taxing living conditions that people have no time to think about freedom.
"Our people are looking for stable management skills and stable policies that can bring them a sense of relief
and freedom," Mr. Mousavi said. The crowd, waving flags in green, his campaign color, chanted "freedom,
freedom."

Gold's Rise
Is the Envy
Of Gold Miners
Gold producers have outperformed the yellow metal recently, but they still have plenty of catching up to do.
Over the past year, the shares of gold-mining companies lost 17%, while gold gained 5%. Year to date,
miners have bettered the metal with a gain of 9% versus 3%.
Will miners continue to outshine? Some clues might lie in Goldcorp's results, due before the market opens
Thursday.
North America's third-largest gold producer is expected to post earnings of 12 cents a share for the first
quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, down from 23 cents a year ago.
The strong price is helping maintain profitability -- the average gold price came in at $907.8 an ounce for the
quarter, a 14% increase from last year.
But rising production costs and lower output have been a drag, themes that emerged in recent investor calls
for Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining. Global mine production contracted 6% in 2008, according to research
firm CPM Group.
Goldcorp experienced delays at its biggest mine late last year due to operational problems, slowdowns
especially painful as the price of gold climbed.
Goldcorp has tried to stand out from peers with a strong growth profile, promising to crank out 3.5 million
ounces of gold in 2013 -- a 52% jump from last year.
On Thursday, investors will seek reassurance that major projects remain on schedule and growth will be
delivered as promised.
Being Productive
Isn't Always Enough
There are times when a productive economy can be counterproductive.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its measure of productivity for the first quarter on Thursday.
Economists, on average, think productivity rose at a 0.3% annualized rate in the quarter after falling 0.4% in
the fourth quarter.
Productivity, which the BLS defines as output per worker hour, held up unusually well during the first few
quarters of the recession. That was partly because of resilient foreign demand for U.S. goods and partly
because U.S. companies were running fairly lean operations that didn't carry too much inventory or expensive
labor.
That changed when the economy fell off a cliff last fall. Then companies couldn't cut output quickly enough to
keep up with vanishing demand, and productivity growth stalled.
After cutting inventories and payrolls, businesses may yet again be lean enough for another productivity pop
as recovering demand forces them to crank out new widgets with meager payrolls.

--- Page 99 ---
Page 99 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Productivity is generally healthy for corporate profits, living standards and economic growth. In this case,
however, a short-term bounce in productivity would come at the expense of workers, whose spending is
needed to help the recovery.
Economists estimate that unit labor costs, a measure of how much money is being spent on workers, rose
2.8% annualized in the first quarter, down from 5.7% in the fourth quarter. That rate will likely keep slowing,
which is good for short-term corporate profits and a curb on inflation, but raises questions about the
recovery's strength.

Big Spending and Easy Money Will Produce a Recovery
Big Spending and Easy Money Will Produce a Recovery
By Michael T. Darda

Congress has just passed the outline of the president's $3.5 trillion budget. This comes on top of the $787
billion stimulus bill in February, and on top of an expansionary monetary policy. The question now is
whether the combination will produce a real recovery.
Here we should look to three historical examples where aggressive monetary expansion was wedded to an
aggressive fiscal policy: the U.S. during the mid-1930s, Germany through the 1930s, and Japan in the early
2000s. In each case there was a recovery, although policy errors led to significant setbacks. These episodes
can help assess U.S. growth prospects, and the risks to a sustainable recovery.
The Great Depression in the U.S. came in two stages, a downturn from 1929-33 in which real GDP collapsed
by 26.5% and unemployment rose to 25% from 3%, and a relapse in 1937-1938, with a 3.4% decline in real
GDP and a rise in unemployment to 19% from 14%.
The first stage of the depression was associated with a collapsing equity bubble (1929), protectionist tariff
legislation (1930), contractionary monetary policy (1931) and a sharp rise in tax rates (1932). Between 1934
and 1937, however, there was a rapid recovery, in part due to the severity of the downturn that preceded it.
Real GDP expanded by 9.5% per annum, while the unemployment rate fell 11 percentage points.
The recovery was spurred in no small part by monetary policy. In 1933-34, the dollar was devalued against
gold to $35 per ounce from $20.67 per ounce, which allowed the Fed to push reserves into the banking
system. This allowed the Fed to finance FDR's deficits with the printing press. After falling at an average rate
of 6.7% per year from 1930-33, the Consumer Price Index rose by an average2.7% per year from 1934-37.
The stock market, which had collapsed by 86.2% between September 1929 and June 1932, rose more than
fourfold in the five years between 1932 and the peak of the next business cycle in 1937. As is customary, the
equity market bottomed nine months before the economy, while the corporate bond market bottomed 10
months before the business cycle trough.
Monetary and fiscal policy were abruptly tightened during 1936-37, with the Fed hiking reserve requirements
and contracting the money supply just as tax rates rose and spending was paired back in an ill-fated attempt
to balance the budget. The economy fell into recession while the stock market plunged 54%.
The German economy expanded rapidly in the 1930s, as large increases in government spending on public
works, construction and rearmament were funded by deficits and easy money. The money stock grew at an
average annual rate of 10% while government expenditures galloped by 30.7% a year. Real GDP expanded
by about 10% per year. Unemployment disappeared. For a time the "German economic miracle" concealed
Hitler's homicidal intentions. Still, Germany suffered from stagnant wages and low productivity. Business
profits and investment did well, but consumer-goods industries languished as wages were restrained by the
state.
On the other side of the Atlantic, FDR took the opposite track and tried to keep wages high by strengthening
union power via the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and later the Wagner Act. This probably kept
unemployment higher than it otherwise would have been.
And Japan? Its fiscal and monetary response to the twin collapse of equity and real-estate bubbles in early
1990s was poorly designed. Government spending was ramped up in the mid-1990s, but much of the
spending was wasteful. Tax rates were raised along the way. The Bank of Japan didn't engage in quantitative
easing until the early 2000s, more than a decade after the real-estate and equity bubbles had begun to burst.
Japan didhave an economic recovery from 2004-07, and a rising stock market to boot. But the recovery was
relatively weak, and it took a long time to emerge. Yet Japan's long recession and weak recovery may not be
the compelling historical parallel for the U.S. that many believe it to be. Japan also suffers from structural
difficulties that aren't relevant in the U.S. today. Its population growth has fallen to zero and is headed into

negative territory. Liquidity growth, which slumped in Japan after its property and equity bubbles began to
burst, has been on a very robust growth track in the U.S.
In sum, history suggests that a highly aggressive monetary policy married to a fiscal expansion will lead to
recovery. The Treasury yield curve is steep and money supply growth has been rapid, a dynamic usually
associated with an eventual pickup in economic growth. Credit spreads have begun to narrow, a sign risk
aversion is easing. Industrial commodity prices, which plunged more than 60% during the second half of
2008, have been firming, a sign that global demand is stabilizing.
All of this suggests the economy will bottom during the second half of 2009 and post solid growth in 2010. But
whether a robust recovery can be sustained is another matter.
U.S. tax rates are scheduled to rise in 2011, when the Bush tax cuts expire. This would be a small negative,
all things being equal. But all things won't be equal. Ultimately the Fed will have to tighten money and begin
to work down its bloated balance sheet. If this occurs as tax rates are adjusting to a higher plateau, there's a
real danger that what appears to be a robust expansion will flame out.

Gold futures hit their highest level in more than a week, with initial weakness in the dollar and inflation
expectations helping to lift prices.
Lightly traded gold for May delivery rose $2.10, or 0.2%, to $903.70 a troy ounce on the Comex division of
the New York Mercantile Exchange, while most-active June rose $2.10 to $904.30.
Gold gave up more than $10 of its early gain on what Craig Ross, vice president with ApexFutures.com,
described as late-day profit-taking. Lind-Waldock senior market strategist Daniel Pavilonis also pointed to a
recovery in the dollar from several-week lows.
Earlier in the session, June gold hit its highest level since April 27. "The dollar is probably the prime reason,"
said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist with BMO Capital Markets.
Early in the session, the euro hit its strongest level against the dollar since April 6. But the greenback later
recovered.
Jon Nadler, analyst with Kitco Bullion Dealers, tied some of gold's early gains to apprehension ahead of the
planned Thursday release of stress-test results for big U.S. banks.
Analysts also cited anticipation of inflation, particularly due to improving U.S. economic data and the
stock-market rally since early March. Any rising price pressures as the economy recovers may be
exacerbated by government stimulus and central-bank monetary-policy moves to revive the economy,
analysts said.
"When there is that much money out there, it has to cause inflation at some point," Mr. Pavilonis said.
Gold's ability to hold up as stocks rise may be due to inflation worries, some observers said. BMO's Mr.
Melek said there hasn't been heavy liquidation of gold exchange-traded funds. As of Monday, SPDR Gold
Shares reported holdings of 1,104.45 metric tons, higher than when the Dow industrials hit a 12-year closing
low on March 9.
"Inflation isn't going to be here for at least another year, but markets are thinking about it," Mr. Melek said.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures fell back after hitting an intraday high of $54.83 for 2009 as economic reports expected
later in the week threatened to dash hopes for a quick economic recovery. Oil traders are bracing for the
results of the government's evaluations of banks and unemployment data for April. Light, sweet crude oil for
June delivery settled 63 cents lower, or 1.2%, at $53.84 a barrel on the Nymex. The slide stopped a four-day
advance.
NATURAL GAS: Futures dropped, pressured by profit-taking, abundant supplies and forecasts for moderate
temperatures in the major U.S. gas-consuming regions. Nymex natural gas for June delivery settled 11 cents
lower, or 3%, at $3.615 a million British thermal units, halting a two-day winning streak. It was the biggest
single-day dollar and percentage decline since April 24.

Thrifty coffee drinkers are increasingly brewing their own cups of joe, helping keep a floor under coffee prices.
Prices of coffee are up 7.3% at ICE Futures U.S. for the year so far, while the broader Dow Jones-AIG
Commodity Index lost 1.3% over the same period. On Monday, coffee contracts for May delivery added 0.3%
to $1.202 a pound, the highest since Feb. 9.
Coffee remains resilient despite a weaker economy and rising jobless claims mainly because consumers are
brewing coffee at home instead of sipping it at upscale restaurants or coffee shops. In a survey by the
National Coffee Association, taken in March, 80% of U.S. coffee drinkers said they had coffee at home the
day before, up from 75% in 2008 and the highest since 2003.
Global coffee consumption rose 1.2% in 2008, says the International Coffee Organization, or ICO.
The alteration of drinking habits is a boon for single-serve coffee makers. The cartridge machines serve one
cup of coffee each time from prepackaged pods. In recent years, they have grown in popularity at home and
offices, due to the combination of the quality of the coffee and the convenience of the pods. For many coffee
drinkers, it is an affordable indulgence: Single-cup coffee typically costs less than $1 a serving, although
consumers have to spend hundreds of dollars on the machines first.
Last year, portioned coffee consumption soared about 20%, much faster than the overall coffee market, said
Richard Girardot, chief executive of Nestle Nespresso SA, a portioned coffee unit at Nestle Group. Nespresso
reported a 34% growth in sales in 2008 to $2 billion from both coffee and machines, the Swiss food giant's
fastest-growing brand.
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., which last week reported its first-quarter earnings more than doubled,
said sales of its single-cup brewersand portion packsgrew 148% and 62%, respectively, over the quarter. The
Waterbury, Vt., company recently announced a partnership with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to distribute its
machines and pods at over 3,000 Wal-Mart stores.
To be sure, coffee demand isn't likely to thrive in a recession. The ICO expects consumption to fall by 1% to
1.5% this year, while the National Coffee Association estimates it will be flat. Mr. Girardot at Nespresso said
sales growth in the fourth quarter slowed from the first three.
Coffee also competes with tea, whose total consumption grew 4.8% last year, according to the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization. Consumers aged from 18 to 24 seem to be switching to tea. This year, only 29%
say they drink coffee, down from 37% in 2007, says the NCA.
Total coffee production is expected to fall to about 125 million bags, from 127.8 million bags last year, says
the ICO.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures settled at a new 2009 high, as surging stocks signaled stronger petroleum demand.
However, U.S. crude-oil stockpiles are at 18 1/2-year highs and are expected to show another rise this week.
Futures rose $1.27, or 2.4%, to $54.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
GOLD: Futures jumped on inflation fears, up $14, or 1.6%, to $901.60 an ounce on Nymex's Comex
division.

Here's something to dream about: The broad U.S. stock market in eight different years since 1926 has gained
at least 37%. Here's something to worry about: It's a risky, risky world.
With economies around the globe hurting, even the optimists have pretty modest hopes for stocks over the
next few years. At the same time, you'll never make up your losses from 2008 if you stay hunkered down in a
money-market account, many of which are yielding almost nothing.
Michael Cuggino, manager of Permanent Portfolio, part of the San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio
Family of Funds Inc., says he hears from friends who "don't want to deal" with their portfolios, or who want to
put their money in a bank instead of the stock market. He understands the wariness. "If you need your money
right away, that might be the best way to go," he says. But "by doing that, you're not positioning yourself for
growth."
What makes for a sensible approach to investing these days? How can a small investor put together a
portfolio now, as the downturn continues with unknown duration, for the eventual better times?
We asked Mr. Cuggino and managers at two other top-performing asset-allocation funds of the past decade
to share their ideas for maneuvering through the turmoil. These are funds whose managers have the ability to
roam across investment areas, increasing and reducing their exposure to cash, bonds and stocks within fairly
large boundaries. Here is what we found.
"A lot of people have a fancy definition of risk," says Edward Studzinski, co-manager since 2000 of Oakmark
Equity and Income fund, run by Harris Associates LP, a Chicago unit of French giant Natixis Global Asset
Management LP. By contrast, he says, the definition he and his fund co-manager use is simple: "We don't
like to lose money, period," he says.
Their fund is down 18.5% over the past 12 months, in the top 9% of Morningstar Inc.'s "moderate allocation"
category. The fund has averaged an 8.1%-ayear return over the past decade, in the top 1% of peers.
Mr. Studzinski and his comanager, Clyde McGregor, have "large personal investments" in the fund, and they
think of their typical customer as a "guy in a factory who no longer has a pension," Mr. Studzinski says. "He
wants to make money, but he wants to sleep at night." Mr. McGregor has managed the fund since 1995.
The co-managers generally keep the fund at about 60% stocks, 40% bonds, but as of early last month they
had about a 50/50 mix.
The recent market rally hasn't changed the fund's more cautious stance. "I still view it as the occasional bull
rally in a bear market," Mr. Studzinski says, adding that "real problems" in the economy "will take some time
to work through."
That said, he adds, as tough as it may be to plow money into stocks after big losses, most "people are still
going to need investments in stocks for their entire lives. That's the only way I can think of to provide some
kind of kicker against inflation."
Their most basic rule for picking stocks is keep it simple.
Never invest in something you can't understand, even if it is recommended by a very smart financial adviser.
"If we can't explain why we're investing in [a stock] in one or two declarative sentences, then we probably
shouldn't be investing in it," Mr. Studzinski says. For instance, the fund hasn't owned big banks for years
"because the transparency and ability to understand all the moving parts became very difficult," he says.

The managers like companies that generate a lot of cash and that don't need to tap the capital markets for
the foreseeable future -- about two or three years. "If a company says it may need to go to the debt market in
a year or two because bonds come due, we're probably not interested in that," he says.
Recently, the fund has invested in industries such as defense, health care and consumer goods -- sectors
from which the managers expect consumers or the government to continue to buy goods and services,
regardless of how bad the economy gets.
Morningstar notes that the fund charges a below-average expense ratio of 0.81%-a-year of assets; the
average asset-allocation fund charges 0.87%. As investors navigate through what has been termed
unprecedented times, one constant is that lower investing costs means that more of the gains stay in their
pocket.
Mr. Cuggino, a certified public accountant who has run the Permanent fund since 1991, says many
mutual-fund managers and investors try to predict the outcome of the many weak spots in the economy, from
housing to unemployment, to figure out how to deploy money. He says there isn't a need to do that if you
build a portfolio with a broad array of investments. That way you are prepared for multiple potential outcomes.
"We believe that people can't accurately predict the future on a consistent basis, and even if they get the
concept right, they might get the timing wrong," he says.
The Permanent Portfolio spreads its money across six asset classes with these allocations as of last month:
Treasurys, 35%; gold, 20%; growth stocks, 15%; real estate and natural resources, 15%; Swiss franc assets,
10%; and silver, 5%.
The stocks should provide a kick under normal economic conditions. Treasurys are there for the tough times
that are all too familiar at this point. The gold stake is designed to preserve purchasing power against the
dollar should inflation hit. Mr. Cuggino believes such inflation may be ahead due to the federal stimulus
package if inflationary pressures aren't addressed quickly enough by the government.
Of course, there's a trade-off: This type of portfolio will trail during market rallies, because so many of the
holdings are designed to outperform during periods of stress. But it should do better than most other funds
during recessionary periods -- as it has during the current one: Its 10.9% loss over the past 12 months, as the
Standard &Poor's 500-stock index returned a negative 35%, including reinvested dividends, puts it in the top
14% of Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category. It has averaged a 8%-a-year return over the past
decade, putting it in the top 1% of its peers.
Mr. Cuggino says investors who don't need their money for a matter of years would be smart to buy stocks.
"Stocks are a good buy right now for a longterm investor who doesn't need to raise cash, has a stomach for
volatility, and believes the economy will recover -- and I put myself in that category."
For people who want to move out of their money-market and bank-CD hiding places but just can't stomach
the risk, the approach of Steven Romick, manager of FPA Crescent Fund since 1993, may hold appeal. Mr.
Romick limited his fund's losses over the past year by keeping a heavy weighting in cash and other liquid
assets, and had about 30% of its money in debt securities as of last month.
His fund, part of First Pacific Advisors LLC in Los Angeles, has returned a negative 18.9% over the past 12
months, in the top 10% of Morningstar's "moderate allocation" category. But over the past 10 years, it has
posted average annual returns of 7.5%, in the top 1%.
Mr. Romick believes that stocks will continue to rally but that "they are still volatile, and I don't need that extra
volatility."
Corporate bonds are hardly risk-free either, he says. Many bonds took losses in 2008, and most corporate
bonds carry bigger risk premiums relative to Treasury debt because of investors' fear of mounting defaults in
the recession.
As of last month, the fund had 29% in cash or liquid assets, down from 50% a year ago. "There's still a lot of
uncertainty, but [cash and liquid assets] have been a margin of safety for the fund, and we've felt less of a
need for that margin of safety," Mr. Romick says. Last month, the fund had about 35% of its money allocated
to stocks, while about 6% was in bearish bets on stocks.
Mr. Romick says he likes having the freedom to invest in a company's bonds if he thinks they are a better
opportunity than the stock. For instance, he recently bought the debt of International Lease Finance, the
aircraft-leasing unit of insurance giant American International Group Inc., a company being bailed out by U.S.
taxpayers.

Mr. Romick's advice to consumers in choosing advisers and fund managers: "Focus on people who have a
proven ability to protect capital in downturns."

Editor's note: Congressman Jack Kemp died Saturday at age 73. The following are excerpts from his many
op-eds for The Wall Street Journal. A related editorial appears nearby.
Central Banks
Must Coordinate
Oct. 22, 1987
Many causes led to this week's world-wide stock-market drop, particularly -- as some of us have warned -- a
monetary system that was an accident waiting to happen and the growing threat of a trade war. But the
ultimate reason is the lack of leadership in the world economy. If the world economy is to be stable, some
country has to provide an open market, crack heads to ensure monetary stability and provide lending in
distress. The market broke, in effect, because American leadership on all these fronts appeared to be
crumbling.
Democrats are quick to draw parallels with the stock-market crash of 1929. The irony is that it's mostly the
Democrats who want to repeat the mistakes that turned the Crash of '29 into the Great Depression.
Democrats have contributed greatly to the crisis with their protectionist trade legislation and tax-increase
proposals. This week they rushed forward with the unlikely theory that the markets are disappointed at
Congress's failure to raise taxes.
Liberate America's
Other Economy
June 12, 1990
In 1984, Mario Cuomo of New York electrified the Democratic Convention with his tale of America as two
cities, one rich and one poor, permanently divided into two classes. He talked about the rich growing richer
and the poor becoming poorer, with the conclusion that class conflict, if not warfare, was the only result, and
redistribution of wealth the solution.
With all due respect to Gov. Cuomo, he got it wrong. America is not divided immutably into two static classes.
But it is separated or divided into two economies. One economy -- our mainstream economy -- is democratic
and capitalist, market-oriented and entrepreneurial. It offers incentives for working families in labor and
management. This mainstream economy rewards work, investment, saving and productivity. Incentives
abound for productive economic and social behavior.
It was this economy, triggered by President Reagan's supply-side revolution of tax cuts in 1981 that
generated 21.5 million new jobs, more than four million new businesses, relatively low inflation and higher
standards of living for most people. This economy has created more jobs in the past decade than all of
Europe, Canada and Japan combined. And according to the U.S. Treasury, federal income taxes paid by the
top 1% of taxpayers has surged by more than 80% to $92 billion in 1987 from $51 billion in 1981.
There is another economy -- a second economy that is similar in respects to the East European or Third
World socialist economies. It functions in a fashion opposite to the mainstream capitalist economy. It
predominates in the pockets of poverty throughout urban and rural America. This economy has barriers to
productive human and social activity and a virtual absence of economic incentives and rewards. It denies
black, Hispanic and other minority men and women entry into the mainstream. This economy works almost as
effectively as did hiring notices 50 years ago that read "No Blacks -- or Hispanics or Irish or whatever -- Need
Apply."

--- Page 110 ---
Page 110 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The irony is that the second economy was born of desire to help the poor, alleviate suffering, and provide a
basic social safety net. The results were a counterproductive economy. Instead of independence, the second
economy led to dependence. In an effort to minimize economic pain, it maximized welfare bureaucracy and
social costs.
The Next 100 Days
April 27, 1993
All Republicans, indeed all Americans, should commend Sen. Bob Dole and Senate Republicans for blocking
President Clinton's so-called stimulus package, a pork-barrel spending plan that deserved defeat regardless
of the economy's health or the size of the deficit.
Republicans now have an opportunity to defeat the Clinton tax increases and to go to the American people
with a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed American leadership in the global
economy.
The first order of business must be debunking the Democrats' notion that higher taxes will lead to a more
prosperous America.
GOP Contract:
My Amendments
Sept. 23, 1994
To promote low interest rates and a stable cost of living, a Republican Congress should amend the
Humphrey-Hawkins Act that now defines the Fed's mission. An amended act should require the Federal
Reserve to publicly target price stability, not unemployment, with a mandatory goal of zero to 2% inflation. . . .
Republicans should go beyond GATT by proposing a Pacific Rim "Nafta," incorporating the Asian nations into
a trans-Pacific free trade zone. Faced with such a dynamic combination, Japan would have little choice but to
reduce its trade barriers and join in. We should quickly extend our free trade agreement to the rest of Latin
and South America, uniting our hemisphere in the world's largest free market -- bringing us one step closer to
the ultimate goal of a "duty-free world."
The Party of Reagan
Or of Hoover?
July 30, 1999
Two decades ago, some congressional Republicans colluded with liberal Democrats on at least 13 different
votes to defeat the Kemp-Roth bill calling for 30% tax-rate cuts over three years. Conservatives were so
obsessed with balanced budgets, and liberals so ideologically opposed to tax-rate cuts, that they were
prepared to sacrifice the well-being of the nation -- then experiencing zero real growth and oppressive
inflation -- in order to satisfy their biases. But when Ronald Reagan came to Washington, Congress finally
enacted our plan, helping to unleash a 17-year economic expansion that, except for three quarters in
1990-91, continues to this day without inflation.
Almost two decades earlier, Republican "debt hawks" like Sen. Barry Goldwater were opposing the tax-rate
reduction plan of President Kennedy, who in 1962 declared that "It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too
high today and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut
the rates now. . . . The purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit, but to achieve the more
prosperous, expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus."
Our Economy Needs
A Golden Anchor
June 28, 2001
Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no great nation in history that went off the gold standard and remained
great. Since Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem dollars held by foreign governments for gold,
we have put that thesis to the test. For the first time in human history, not a single major currency in the world
was linked to a commodity. Economist Milton Friedman called the situation "unprecedented" and said it is "not
a long-term viable alternative." "The world," he said, "needs a long-term anchor of some kind."

--- Page 111 ---
Page 111 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. In creating a world monetary system of floating fiat currencies
with the stroke of a pen, President Nixon touched off world-wide inflation that lasted through the '70s and
early '80s.
Yet America recovered to preside over the demise of world communism, and overcame the rising inflation
and unemployment of "stagflation" to enjoy an unparalleled 18-year economic expansion. Today, the U.S. is
at the pinnacle of its power and enjoying its greatest prosperity ever.
Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong? I don't think so. If the U.S. has so far come out on top in this
experiment, it is only because other countries' economies have suffered even more from floating currencies.
Once the U.S. government ceased redeeming gold at $35 an ounce, its price quadrupled on world markets to
$140 to reflect the dollar's diminished value. By breaking the gold link, the Nixon economic team forced the
unwanted liquidity pouring out of the Fed -- which had thus far built up in the Eurodollar market and the
portfolios of foreign central banks -- to remain inside the U.S. economy where it would manifest itself in price
inflation. Robert Mundell was the first to predict, in January 1972, there would soon be a dramatic rise in the
price of oil, with general inflation to follow.
Where the rest of the economics profession blamed the Arab oil-producing states for quadrupling the oil price
in 1973, Mr. Mundell and those supply-siders who followed his intellectual lead knew that gold's quadrupling
had led the way. Tax rates rose through "bracket creep," capital formation stopped in its tracks, and it soon
took two workers to produce the same income that one had brought home before the experiment. The
stagflation that had its roots in leaving the gold standard was compounded when Congress and three
different presidents tried to fight it with wage and price controls and high marginal tax rates.
GOP Protectionists
March 6, 2007
As the GOP stumbles around Washington trying to be the party of Herbert Hoover, it's sad to see so many
Republicans drifting so far and so fast from the Reagan model that helped pave the way for the great,
non-inflationary economic and jobs expansion of the past 25 years.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) threatens China with a 28% tariff for daring to tie the yuan to the dollar. Rep.
Tom Tancredo, running for president, is miffed at President Bush for trying to design comprehensive
immigration-reform legislation. The president wants a guest-worker program that could help alleviate border
problems in the Southwest.
But Mr. Tancredo is a sissy compared to my old pal Duncan Hunter, the congressman from San Diego. He's
also running in the GOP primaries as an unambiguous Hoover-like protectionist and anti-globalization
candidate. Then there's my other old friend Pat Buchanan, railing against Japan and Toyota for having the
chutzpah to sell so many cars in the U.S., even going so far as to build manufacturing plants right here under
our noses.
Obama and
Economic Opportunity
April 17, 2008
In my opinion, people of all colors and income levels don't hate the rich. They want to get rich. They're more
interested in generating wealth than they are in redistributing wealth. They want to own property, educate
their children and build a nest egg that can be passed on to their heirs. Unfortunately, some aren't able to
access the same ladder of opportunity that is so readily available to the majority. . . .
By giving people access to capital and allowing them to take ownership of assets, entrepreneurship will be
encouraged and the cycle of poverty can begin to be broken. All persons should have the opportunity to go as
high as their merit and determination can carry them. My favorite quote is from Abraham Lincoln, who said, "I
don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So while we do
not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with
everybody else."
Lincoln's definition of entrepreneurial capitalism is the best I have ever heard.
It's Time to Think Big
On Tax Cuts
Oct, 8, 2008 (with Peter Ferrara)

John McCain needs to show the nation that he has the economic recovery plan to restore long-term
economic growth. To do that, he needs to refocus his campaign with a new tax plan. Mr. McCain should
come out for an alternative, optional flatter tax system, which he has already supported. . . .
Mr. Obama, by contrast, offers tax increases on savers, investors, small business, employers, and other job
creators, a trillion dollar plus spending increase, and new regulatory burdens. That has no prospect of
restoring economic growth. It will only do the opposite.

Surveying Chrysler as Wheels Fall Off
Strange things happen on planet Chrysler.
A car company bought for $38 billion in 1998 gets unloaded to another buyer at a cost of about $1 billion
almost a decade later. Two years after that, another company, Italy's Fiat this time, stands ready to take a
20% stake plus options for more in exchange for know-how, but no cash. Employees plan on taking a
majority stake. Oh, and secured lenders to Chrysler get offered 33 cents on the dollar to go away.
Dissident creditors are justified in holding out against this two-thirds haircut. After all, the United Auto Workers
union is set to get an implied 50 cents on the dollar -- plus a 55% stake in the new company. The large banks
that hold the majority of Chrysler's $6.9 billion of secured debt and negotiated the terms on offer are
recipients of aid from a government desperate for a quick fix. Not for nothing do the dissident creditors call
themselves Chrysler's "Non-TARP Lenders."
Bankruptcy court, however, is an unpredictable place, and the dissident group shows signs of unraveling
already: Late Thursday, prominent hold-out Perella Weinberg Partners conceded.
In court, Chrysler would likely argue its brands are deteriorating by the day. It would hope to press the judge
to force the existing deal in the best interests of preserving the business, similar to the quick sale of Lehman
Brothers' North American businesses to Barclays in September.
Chrysler mightn't be as much of a melting ice cube as Lehman. But drivers' faith in Chrysler is arguably fragile
already. Concerns over damage to the wider automotive supply chain might also color the judge's thinking.
Six parts suppliers were placed on watch by Standard &Poor's following Chrysler's bankruptcy filing
Thursday.
Despite their sound argument, therefore, those Non-TARP Lenders left face formidable obstacles.
Bondholders at General Motors, offered awful terms earlier this week, should be nervous.
So the president, the UAW and Fiat look set to win? Not completely. The administration risks distorting
America's capital markets: If the current plan is pushed through, then good luck to any unionized firm trying to
raise secured debt on decent terms in the future. As for the UAW, making a success of the new Chrysler will
likely require taking the sort of painful decisions unions are programmed to resist.
That leaves Fiat. With no cash upfront, the car maker has limited its potential losses. But it isn't hard to
envision a scenario in a few years where Chrysler is still struggling and stretching Fiat's management, while
the Italian company takes flak from U.S. politicians and union members. Daimler and Cerberus Capital
Management can testify that strange things happen when you land on planet Chrysler.

Colgate Might Be Wise to Brush Up on Ad Strategy
Colgate or Crest? Consumer-product companies pump more than most into marketing budgets to woo
shoppers. Scaling back ad spending will polish short-term results, but is it worth the risk to brand loyalty?
Colgate-Palmolive spent roughly 24% less on advertising last quarter, causing a surprise boost to earnings.
Colgate is putting more emphasis on discounting prices, a necessary tactic at a time when cheaper options
are gaining traction.
The strategy is paying off -- so far. Amid a global recession, Colgate posted one of the strongest sales results
in the consumer-product sector for the first quarter. Colgate's organic sales, excluding foreign exchange and
acquisitions, rose 8% from a year earlier. Rival Procter &Gamble's sales increased just 1%.

--- Page 114 ---
Page 114 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But there is danger in letting advertising slip for long. Consider Coca-Cola's missteps earlier this decade.
Coke lowered advertising costs by 22% in the first five years through 2004, only to reverse the move after
admitting the brand had suffered.
Colgate shouldn't make the same mistake. Advertising spending accounted for 11% of its sales in the past
three years, even more than the percentage at P&G, the world's largest advertiser by dollars spent. The
marketing focus had helped Colgate hold its ground against P&G.
Colgate can probably get away with temporary ad cuts in markets where it dominates, such as South
America. Rivals there face cost-cutting pressure.
But in the U.S., the worry is that P&G, which hasn't cut ad spending as much, takes market share over time.
That would leave Colgate with a steep hill to climb.

The Bold Take a Flier on Airlines
This week's fall in European airline stocks shows gloomy sentiment over the sector isn't lifting. And why
should it, with falling passenger numbers, rapid cash burn, truculent unions and now a flu outbreak? But
looking past current troubles could reward the brave investor.
European flag carriers are trading near historic lows. British Airways is on a price-to-cash-flow multiple of 1.2
times, Air France-KLM on 1.4 times, and Deutsche Lufthansa on 1.9 times.
These low valuations, about 50% below five-year averages, price in fears of potentially dilutive equity raises.
Citigroup reckons BA and Air France might burn through 75% of their 2008 year-end cash piles by March
2010 and the sector will collectively post a 1.8 billion euro ($2.4 billion) operating loss in the first quarter.
But airlines aren't completely helpless. Lufthansa raised 850 million euros in the credit market in March,
paying a 6.75% coupon, to add to its 3 billion euro cash pile at the end of 2008. Others are eyeing asset sales
or deferring new jet deliveries.
If such moves buy airlines time to return to midcycle profitability, UBS estimates suggest share-price upsides
of 100%, 62% and 65% for BA, Air France and Lufthansa. For true risk aficionados, that is a tempting reward
for sticking with the airlines through one of the toughest environments they have experienced.

Rally in Dubai
Looks Dubious
On S&P Move
Green shoots in the desert? Not so fast. Hopes that Dubai's economy was recovering have been dashed by
Standard &Poor's putting six government-related entities on negative watch ahead of possible downgrades to
"junk." That raises fresh doubts over Dubai's ability to raise funds on international markets and the possibility
it will need another bailout from Abu Dhabi.
The S&P move is a shock after recent statements from Dubai officials that the emirate's financial difficulties
were under control. Earlier this year, Dubai secured a $20 billion bailout underwritten by the Abu Dhabi-based
central bank. Abu Dhabi has released the first $10 billion, with international investors expected to provide the
rest.
But Dubai's problems could be worse than initially thought. What prompted the S&P decision was
confirmation that real-estate developer Nakheel and parent company Dubai World may have to restructure
debts amid plummeting revenue. Foreign contractors also have complained of delays in payment.
Bankers say the S&P action was priced into the market for Nakheel. But this latest blow is bound to make
international investors more wary of subscribing to the second half of the $20 billion emergency bond
program.
That could force Dubai to return to Abu Dhabi for the rest of the money. But its larger neighbor has its own
problems. Its sovereign-wealth funds are losing money. Mubadala Development Co. lost more than $3 billion
last year. And with oil around $50 a barrel, Abu Dhabi will have to dip into foreign reserves to help its federal
partners.
In the desert, green shoots often turn out to be mirages.

So near and yet so far. John Paulson joined forces with the Haas family earlier this year to pump $2.5 billion
into Dow Chemical in a successful effort to get Dow to complete its acquisition of Rohm &Haas. His hedge
fund had a big position in Rohm and stood to lose if the acquisition fell through. The strategy paid off --
particularly for Dow's common shareholders. Dow stock is up 90% since March 30, including an 18% rise
Thursday on strong earnings. Unfortunately for Paulson, his preferred stock isn't convertible into common.

Is gold losing its luster? After several hedge funds plowed money into the metal to hedge against financial
Armageddon, at least one manager has become less pessimistic. In his quarterly summary sent to investors
this week, Third Point's Daniel Loeb said he had closed out "doomsday" trades, including gold-related
investments.

Activists Must Adjust Their Aim
It's hard to scare a target when you are on the run yourself. But that is the awkward position in which activist
investors find themselves.
Activist funds lost almost 10% in the first two months of this year, after falling almost 31% last year, according
to Hedge Fund Research. That's worse than other hedge funds and in line with the overall market, suggesting
that many are simply long-only investors who take concentrated positions in single stocks.
Meanwhile, many of the largest activists are dealing with unhappy investors who are fleeing their hedge
funds. A focused fund started by William Ackman succeeded in getting Target to buy back shares, among
other things. But Target has resisted some of his other suggestions. And amid the market downturn, Mr.
Ackman's Target fund has lost more than 50% since its launch.
Despite such setbacks, activists might again be trying to flex their muscles, pumped up by gains of 9.3% in
March. Carl Icahn has been pushing top executives at Amylin Pharmaceuticals to trim waste and not resist
any possible sale. Smaller hedge funds such as Ironfire Capital are preparing to launch campaigns, according
to people familiar with the matter.
The question is what playbook will work in today's environment. Activists have spent much of the past few
years pushing companies to take on more debt and pay out cash to shareholders. It turns out that many of
the companies were correct to try to conserve cash for a rainy day, given the tsunami in the markets and
economy that subsequently resulted. Companies should easily shrug off pressure to return cash right now.
Another activist favorite, pressuring companies to break up or sell themselves, also could be a challenge.
Financing markets remain in disarray and valuations are distressed in many cases.
And such attempts have included notable failures. Investors jumped into Yahoo stock when Mr. Icahn last
year pushed the company to sell to Microsoft, figuring he could bridge the gap between the two sides. But
they still are dragging their feet, and Yahoo is down more than 40% since he got involved.
A more fruitful area could be on forcing cost cuts. Activists have often targeted entrenched and overpaid
managers they believe are looking after themselves rather than shareholders. With many executives
receiving generous compensation packages, even as their companies struggle, there could be plenty fodder
for activists. A range of academic research suggests that hedge-fund activists have had a positive impact in
areas such as reining in executive pay and perks.
Research also shows that activists can have a positive impact on long-term share prices, although some
studies cover bull-market periods when companies could be successfully prodded to sell themselves or
certain assets and pile on debt to boost payouts. In today's leaner times, activists have their work cut out
demonstrating that they aren't a spent force.

In the Chinalco Deal, a Road Not Taken Is Beckoning Rio Tinto
If the Rio Tinto board faced the same choice on fixing its balance sheet today as it did in the dark days of
February, it is a fair bet it would take a different course. It would likely opt for a rights issue rather than its
complex $19.5 billion deal with Chinalco, a Chinese state-controlled company.
Since its original decision, commodity prices have soared, boosting mining valuations and undermining much
of the rationale for the deal. Even so, that is unlikely to be enough on its own to persuade Rio to walk away.

--- Page 117 ---
Page 117 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Rio's liquidity position has improved considerably. Assume a one-off cut to iron-ore prices of 30% from April
this year; that aluminium and copper prices stay around today's levels; and Rio completes the $10 billion
rights issue it previously considered.
It would meet its $18.9 billion of loan repayments through 2010 with some room to spare, according to broker
Canaccord Adams. With the bond markets open, as demonstrated by Rio's recent $3.5 billion issue, Rio
should have some flexibility.
But Rio's lingering problem isn't just liquidity but excessive leverage. The attraction of the Chinalco deal is
that it includes asset sales, enabling Rio to refinance debts and reduce leverage upfront, without being
exposed to the vagaries of metal prices. That is still an important consideration, particularly given the
uncertainty over the global economic outlook. Rio can't afford to walk away from Chinalco only to find metal
prices slump again and it needs to sell assets at fire-sale prices.
That means Rio would likely want the comfort of firm bids for some assets before it would consider
abandoning Chinalco. Bankers say there is no shortage of interest. But it isn't clear whether there are real
offers at high enough prices to justify Rio paying Chinalco a $195 million breakup fee and risk offending its
biggest customer: China.
Chinalco has set the bar high, particularly with the price it is paying for a stake in Rio's Escondida copper
mine in Chile.
Attractive bids may yet materialize. After all, rival mining companies, among them Rio's erstwhile suitor BHP
Billiton, have a strategic interest in preventing Rio getting too cozy with China.
Such moves would put Rio's board in a bind. Walking away from Chinalco would almost certainly cost Rio
boss Tom Albanese his job and would be an embarrassing U-turn for the board as a whole.
Still, at least it would avoid the possible humiliation of having a deal turned down by either its own
shareholders or the Australian government.

Machinery Stocks Not On the Head
A "U" or an "L" won't get you much in Scrabble, or in machinery stocks.
For investors in the sector, '09 is largely a done deal. The message alongside first-quarter results was that of
hunkering down with cost cuts to cope with weak demand.
The issue is duration. Take Caterpillar. Reduced 2009 earnings-per-share projections of $1.25 imply a
price/earnings multiple of 27 times. Investors are clearly looking through the trough: After all, not so long ago
the company was earning north of $5 a share.
For 2010, the consensus forecast implies a multiple of 21 times. But look at the range: The highest estimate,
according to Thomson Reuters, is eight times the lowest.
With the outlook so foggy, why pay so much on a two-year view? Caterpillar did well from a construction
boom in the U.S. and Middle East that isn't coming back soon. U.S. shipments of steel for construction and
contractors' products fell 58% in the first two months of 2009.
Chinese infrastructure offers some hope. But brokerage Sterne Agee estimates all of Asia accounts for only
15% of the firm's sales. And with China a buzzword for all manner of competing companies seeking growth,
it's questionable how high margins on such business will be. Tellingly, Swiss industrial giant ABB, which
should profit from Chinese infrastructure, provides targets only for 2011, not the no-man's land in between.
Were corporate executives really envisioning a "V"-shaped recovery, instead of a "U" or "L," it's doubtful they
still would be cutting capacity or leaving question marks hanging over dividends. Investors should take their
cue from that.

One place the Federal Reserve isn't printing money: its pension fund. The Fed's plan was underfunded by $2
billion at the end of 2008, with 30% less assets than its $7 billion of obligations. A rather aggressive 66%
allocation to stocks at the start of the year helped the portfolio lose $1.3 billion in value.

Safety in letters? After a mauling in 2008, hedge funds are seeking sanctuary in exchange-traded funds.
Millennium Management, Pequot Capital Management, Traxis Partners, Greenlight Capital, Highfields Capital
Management and other managers have listed ETFs tracking everything from gold to broad market indexes
among their largest holdings at year end.
Many ETFs are indeed inexpensive and liquid. But investors might wonder why they are paying big fees to
have somebody buy into off-the-shelf products that simply track broad markets or sectors on their behalf.
Whatever happened to seeking alpha?

Gold Reclaims the $900 Level

Gold rose sharply on flight-to-safety demand, with the move accelerated by technical chart-based buying.
The nearby April gold contract gained $14.10, or 1.6%, to $905.90 an ounce on the Comex division of the
New York Mercantile Exchange, while the most-active June contract advanced $14.10 to $906.60.
"I suspect that we've had a revival of the safe-haven appeal of gold," said Bart Melek, commodity strategist
with BMO Capital Markets.
Analysts listed several factors for this, including a softer tone in stocks for much of the day before the gold
day-session close and a weaker dollar. Some gold buying was related to concerns about coming stress tests
for U.S. banks, said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst with MF Global.
Soft weekly jobless claims were supportive of gold, as the data pointed to more worries about the economy.
Renewed inflation concerns because of government and central-bank efforts to revive the economy also
made the yellow metal appealing, said Charles Nedoss, senior account manager and metals analyst with
Peak Trading Group.
Speculators were among the buyers, said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global
Futures. Volume was brisk, he added.
"The investment buying this morning really showed itself as we approached $900 on no news, when there
was a spike higher," Mr. Pawlicki of MF Global said. "And then when prices took out $900, there was
technical buying."
Buy stops, or preplaced orders triggered when certain chart points are hit, were triggered in June gold
around $900 to the April 15 high of $902.10. The contract went on to a $910.40 peak that was its strongest
since April 3.
"That's sort of the line in the sand for a lot of traders -- around $900," said Frank Lesh, futures analyst with
FuturePath Trading. Some bought in the belief that gold was making a breakout higher, while stops were
triggered to cover positions of others who previously sold gold.
Yet another supportive influence for gold was the willingness of investors to hold on to their exchange-traded
fund positions, said Mr. Melek of BMO Capital Markets. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF stood at
1,105.98 metric tons as of Wednesday, not far from the recent record of 1,127.68.
In other trading:
CRUDE OIL: Futures increased for a third session in a row, shuffling higher with stock markets amid the
search for signs that falling demand will stabilize. Light, sweet crude oil for June delivery settled 77 cents, or
1.6%, higher at $49.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
COPPER: Some futures prices extended losses to below $2 a pound under pressure from weaker stocks as
the metal's correction continued on profit-taking through long liquidation. News that General Motors plans to
idle most of its U.S. plants for nine weeks this summer also was weighing on copper. The April copper
contract on Nymex's Comex unit fell 6.15 cents a pound, or 3%, to $2.0130..

Against Insect Plague, Nevadans Wield Ultimate Weapon: Hard Rock --- Tiny Tuscarora Counts on
Stereos Arrayed In Desert to Repel Hungry Mormon Crickets

TUSCARORA, Nev. -- The residents of this tiny town, anticipating an imminent attack, will be ready with a
perimeter defense. They'll position their best weapons at regular intervals, faced out toward the desert to
repel the assault.
Then they'll turn up the volume.
Rock music blaring from boomboxes has proved one of the best defenses against an annual invasion of
Mormon crickets. The huge flightless insects are a fearsome sight as they advance across the desert in
armies of millions that march over, under or into anything in their way.
But the crickets don't much fancy Led Zeppelin or the Rolling Stones, the townspeople figured out three years
ago. So next month, Tuscarorans are preparing once again to get out their extension cords, array their
stereos in a quarter-circle and tune them to rock station KHIX, full blast, from dawn to dusk. "It is part of our
arsenal," says Laura Moore, an unemployed college professor and one of the town's 13 residents.
In flyspeck villages like Tuscarora, crickets are a serious matter. The critters hatch in April in the barren soil of
northern Nevada, western Utah and other parts of the Great Basin, quickly growing into blood-red, ravenous
insects more than 2 inches long.
Then they march. In columns that in peak years can be two miles long and a mile across, swarms move
across the badlands in search of food. Starting in about May, they march through August or so, before
stopping to lay eggs for next year and die.
In between, they make an awful mess. They destroy crops and lots of the other leafy vegetation. They crawl
all over houses, and some get inside. "You'll wake up and there'll be one sitting on your forehead, looking at
you," says Ms. Moore.
They swarm on roads, where cars turn them into slicks that can cause accidents. So many dead ones piled
up on a highway last year that Elko County, Nev., called in snowplows to scrape them off.
Squashed and dying crickets give off a sickening smell. "For us, it's mostly the yuck factor," says Ron
Arthaud, a painter here.
Many springs, the infestation is negligible. But every few years, far bigger swarms hatch. From 2003 to 2006,
armies of crickets went forth. They smothered the county seat, Elko, causing pandemonium as residents fled
indoors. Realtor Jim Winer couldn't, because he had to show homes. "I carried a little broom in my car," he
says, "and when I got out, I would sweep a path through the bugs to the house."
Every half-century or so, plaguelike numbers hatch. The critters got their name in the 19th century after a
throng of them ravaged the crops of a Mormon settlement. But "I don't think they care about Mormons or
Baptists," says Lynn Forsberg, who runs Elko County's public-works program. "I don't think they care about
anything."
Including one another. Mormon crickets are programmed to march. Any cricket that falls by the wayside is
eaten by others, ensuring that at least some cross the hot, barren stretches well-fed.
Following an unseasonably warm winter, some in Elko County fear a big crop this year of Mormon crickets,
known more precisely as shield-backed katydids, or Anabrus simplex. State entomologist Jeff Knight is using
computer models to document when the crickets will hatch, and "once they have hatched, we will start going
in and mapping where all the crickets are," he says.

Towns in their path aren't waiting to find out. Elko County officials have stored tons of poison bait, which
they'll soon start handing out. Placed properly, it can help. In 2003, which was a bad year, residents
organized a bucket brigade to lay poison bait in the countryside, luring many bugs to their doom.
But last year Diana Bunitsky sprinkled the bait too close -- right outside the rural diner she runs, Lone
Mountain Station -- and crickets swarmed onto her property to gobble it. Ms. Bunitsky ran outside and
sprayed them with a garden hose, "but when I looked back, they had gone around and were all over my
walls," she says.
Some people use chalk dust to try to smother crickets. Lori Roa, a job counselor in Elko, swears by Lemon
Joy. She sprinkles the detergent over her shrubbery. In Jarbidge, Nev., Rey Nystrom, proprietor of the
Jarbidge Trading Post, says a neighbor uses a squirt bottle loaded with soapy water. "But you're squirting one
at a time, so it's spitting against the wind, so to speak," he says.
Here in Tuscarora, signs are worrisome this spring. Numerous cricket nymphs in the sandy soil are beginning
to wiggle, says Elaine Parks, a local artist.
Tuscarora began as a gold-mining town in the late 19th century, and by 1878 had a population of 5,000. But
the ore mostly petered out by 1900, and the town has been dwindling ever since, to its current size of just
over a dozen. ("But in summer we get up to 20," says postmaster Julie Parks.)
There are hints the community has mixed feelings toward its crickets. The town sports a giant sculpture of a
Morman cricket, made out of chicken wire, burlap and glue. For the Fourth of July parade last year, three
women dressed up as "cricket witches."
But when a throng of crickets began to advance ominously on Tuscarora in the spring of 2006, Ms. Parks, the
artist, dug up a 1934 article in the Elko Free Press about a woman who had used a Chinese gong to drive
them away. That led to the modern adaptation of a boombox perimeter.
"Crickets kind of sleep at night, so I would wake up first thing in the morning to get the music on and we
would shut the music off at night," Ms. Moore says. Townsfolk cranked up the volume throughout the daylight
hours for several days in a row.
"The theory was they'd hate heavy metal," Ms. Parks says. Indeed, locals report, in 2006, at least, many of
the bugs stopped in their tracks. Says Mr. Knight, the entomologist: "The vibrations may deter the bugs, but I
don't know of any research that says yes or no."
Some of the following year's crickets had hipper tastes, waltzing in to lay their eggs, as many as 100 apiece.
In 2008, these eggs hatched right in the middle of Tuscarora. "They were crawling all over the side of the
houses and three deep in the yard eating each other," Ms. Moore says.
The nymphs now wriggling in the dry soil near homes are too close to people for poison bait, although
residents will probably try some when the hatchlings start to move about.
To fend off the armies marching in from outside, Tuscarora is ready to deploy the boombox defense again.
"We'll have to come up with a playlist for the crickets," Ms. Parks says.
They have a fallback strategy, to make even more noise if rock music isn't enough: The townsfolk plan to
crank up their lawn mowers and Weed Whackers.

Crude Plunges 8.8% as Doubts On Economic Stability Return

Crude Plunges 8.8% as Doubts On Economic Stability Return

NEW YORK -- Crude-oil futures plunged to a more-than-five-week low Monday, as new concerns about the
stability of the U.S. economy sparked a selloff that reached most corners of the commodities and equities
markets.
Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled $4.45, or 8.8%, lower at $45.88 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
The biggest single-day decline for oil prices in dollar terms since March 2 was sparked by fears that the U.S.
economy was about to start a new leg lower.
Investors questioned a recent string of stronger-than-expected quarterly results from major banks and spent
the day preparing for new instability in the financial sector.
Oil prices are now at their lowest level since mid-March, when the Federal Reserve said it would spend more
than $1 trillion shoring up financial institutions by purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed
securities, effectively printing money.
Oil was just one of many commodities experiencing heavy selling, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average
closed down 3.6%. Much of the buying shifted to "safe haven" investments such as gold and the dollar,
which are believed to hold more of their value in a severe downturn. The dollar reached its strongest point
against the euro since mid-March.
"What we're seeing here once again is a fear play," said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago. "People are trying to protect themselves."
The oil market is now at a critical juncture, Mr. Flynn said, as futures have broken through the price floor of
$47 a barrel created over the last month, when optimism about the U.S. economy began to push commodities
and equities higher.
That belief in an approaching rebound had helped oil traders play down the importance of a growing glut of
crude. U.S. oil inventories recently hit their highest point since September 1990, and analysts anticipate
another increase in data scheduled to be reported this week.
"There shouldn't be much demand for a May crude-oil barrel, and that's being reflected in the crude-oil price
today," said Peter Donovan, vice president of Vantage Trading in New York.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices rose as stocks tumbled, with analysts citing a pickup in physical buying in Asia after the recent
correction lower in gold prices and ahead of an Indian holiday this month. The nearby April gold contract
settled $19.60 higher, up 2.3%, at $887 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. The most-active
June contract increased $19.60, to $887.50.
COPPER: Futures lost ground because of economic worries and as stocks faltered and the U.S. dollar rose.
The thinly traded nearby April Comex copper contract lost 8.3 cents, or 3.8%, to settle at $2.1285 a pound.
The most-active July contract declined 9.25 cents, to $2.105.

Copper Prices Get a Lift
From Chinese Buying;
Economy on the Mend?
When investors talk heavy metal these days, it isn't gold on their minds.
The decline in the dollar pushed up gold prices into the beginning of March, but since then, the strongest
metals markets have been the industrial ones: those with uses in manufacturing, such as aluminum, zinc, and
particularly copper, a popular bellwether for economic demand.
Copper prices have risen for five consecutive weeks, bolstered in part by Chinese government efforts to
renew demand in the emerging economic power. The country has been buying copper to help its struggling
smelters, which have reduced production because of weak demand.
"China, rather than buy gold to diversify away from the dollar, is buying something they feel they have an
immediate or shorter-term need for," says Andrew Montano, director of precious metals at ScotiaMocatta in
Toronto.
Front-month copper has surged 59% so far this year. The April contract settled at $2.2115 per pound Friday
on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest level since Oct. 15, 2008. This week,
China will release data on copper imports for March, and they are likely to have surpassed China's own
monthly production for the first time.
The gains also reflect expectations that the economic environment world-wide is on the mend. Darin
Newsom, senior commodities analyst at DTN in Omaha, Neb., says copper's resurgence has coincided with
the rebound in stocks, to the detriment of the gold market, which has sagged.
"I think the inverse relationship between [gold] and the Dow is still driving things," he says. "We've seen a
rally in the Dow Jones and that sort of coincides with the rally in the copper market."
Gold for April delivery has finished lower for four consecutive weeks on Comex. It settled at $867.40 an
ounce on Friday, and has declined 9.3% in those four weeks.
Investors have continued to look to gold as a harbinger of inflation concerns, but for now, those concerns
remain more of a theoretical threat.

Natural Gas Sputters on Weak Demand --- Robust Supply Keeps Pressure on Fuel Prices; No Kick From the Cold

Natural Gas Sputters on Weak Demand --- Robust Supply Keeps Pressure on Fuel Prices; No Kick

HOUSTON -- Natural-gas futures fell Thursday as weak industrial and weather-related demand and bulging
supplies of the fuel continue to pressure prices.
Natural gas for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled floor trading down 9.4 cents, or
2.6%, at $3.599 a million British thermal units. The contract sank to $3.534 in earlier combined electronic and
floor trade after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported natural-gas stockpiles grew by 21 billion
cubic feet last week.
The storage build was largely in line with analyst expectations and matched the five-year average build, but
the report was still considered bearish because colder weather last week should have resulted in a smaller
storage injection.
Kent Bayazitoglu, director of analytics for Houston-based Gelber &Associates, said the reported build
"continues to support that we have excess gas in the system and that we will have a strong injection season."
Natural gas in U.S. storage for the week ended April 10 stood at 1.695 trillion cubic feet -- 34.8% higher than
last year and 22.5% higher than the five-year average.
The surplus in natural gas has contributed to the steep decline in gas prices, which have plunged by about
74% from highs last summer as the economic downturn caused demand for the fuel to diminish.
Earlier this week, the EIA projected natural-gas consumption in the industrial sector, which accounts for about
a third of U.S. consumption, would decline by more than 7% this year. The statistical arm of the Department
of Energy also said that inventories could rise to record levels by the end of the summer injection season,
when natural-gas stocks are replenished to meet winter heating demand.
The National Weather Service forecast for April 21 to April 25 calls for colder-than-normal temperatures
across the eastern half of the country.
Jim Ritterbusch, president of the energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates, said below-normal
temperatures this time of year don't translate to big swings in natural-gas consumption. "There is too much
supply and there is a lack of weather-related demand," Mr. Ritterbusch said.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of Nymex slipped as interest in buying the precious metal as a
safe-haven investment waned because of stabilizing equities markets. Nearby April gold dropped $13.50, or
1.5%, to settle at $879.30 a troy ounce. Most-active June gold fell $13.70 to $879.80.
COPPER: Comex prices declined in large part because of economic data from China, a major copper user.
Nearby April copper fell two cents, or 0.9%, to $2.1835 a pound, while most-active May copper shed 2.95
cents to $2.1695. Copper's decline came in the wake of a report showing 6.1% first-quarter Chinese
gross-domestic-product growth. "The GDP seems to be coming down a little bit with each new report we see.
So that took a little steam out of the market," said Bill O'Neill, one of the principals with Logic Advisors.

The U.S. and Europe were widely expected to clash at the G-20 summit in London last month over how to
address the global financial crisis. Voila, in just two days the problem was solved with a joint promise to
increase International Monetary Fund resources by $750 billion to a total of $1 trillion.
The U.S. portion of this new commitment is more than $140 billion. Yet Congress has debated neither the
amount nor the proposed use of the funds. Instead, President Obama and his fellow leaders simply waved
their hands, like a Star Trek captain, and said make it so.
Recall that the IMF was founded in 1944 when the world monetary system operated on a gold standard. The
fund's job was to act as a lender of last resort when countries encountered balance-of-payments shortfalls.
When the world went to a fiat-currency system, the fund's original role became obsolete. It is possible to
argue that a modified version of the lender-of-last-resort remains important for the global financial system. But
over the past 30 years the fund has increasingly strayed from that limited mission to become a vehicle for
transferring wealth to poor-country governments. The London agreement further advances these foreign aid
ambitions with no oversight from Congress.
Exhibit A is a $250 billion increase in "special drawing rights," or SDRs -- one third of the new resources.
SDRs are homemade credit allocations printed by the fund and handed out to all members. They are
redeemable for subsidized loans from hard-currency fund countries. Prior to last week, there were about $32
billion in SDRs. The fund's board had lobbied for 12 years to double that number. But because the loans cost
taxpayers more than $300 million a year and because there are no minimum governance standards that must
be met by borrowers, Congress refused to approve the expansion.
Now Mr. Obama has overruled Congress and blessed an SDR increase -- not twice the existing number, but
eight times. As Juergen Stark, a member of the European Central Bank Executive Board, told the German
daily Handelsblatt, "It was never examined whether there indeed is a global need for additional liquidity,"
adding that "one used to take a lot of time to check something like this." He also called it "helicopter money
for the globe." If Mr. Stark keeps this up, his G-20 dining privileges will be revoked.
As to the other $500 billion, here is the G-20 communique: "We have agreed to increase the resources
available to the IMF through immediate financing from members of $250 billion, subsequently incorporated
into an expanded and more flexible New Arrangements to Borrow [NAB], increased by up to $500 billion, and
to consider market borrowing if necessary."
Keep your eye on that "expanded and more flexible" lingo. Fund rules state clearly that money under NAB
can only be used "to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system or to deal with
an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system." In other words, to draw on the NAB
the IMF has to argue convincingly that there is systemic risk. Moreover, there is a clear view that the money
should be repaid as the crisis passes.
But now the NAB will be "expanded and more flexible." This implies an intention to alter the restrictive nature
of NAB lending so that the London commitments can be used at the discretion of the fund, without approval of
the contributors. A fund spokesman told us that the idea of increasing flexibility is that "the NAB money
becomes part of the general resources of the fund and if the managing director decides that the fund needs to
step in somewhere, it can."
That would be nirvana to IMF employees who have been running low on money to lend but love to roam the
world signing up new "clients." Borrowers would like it too, since they take the general resources of the fund
at rock-bottom rates with no implied obligation ever to retire the loan.
You may wonder why the IMF simply doesn't ask for a quota increase to expand its resources. Probably
because that requires 85% of member votes and can take years. By using the NAB, Treasury can simply

--- Page 129 ---

attach the request to any spending bill, and that is apparently what we can expect. A U.S. Treasury official
told us last week that "the current U.S. share of the NAB is about 20%, so consistent with that, our share of a
NAB increase of $500 billion could be up to $100 billion."
The upshot for U.S. taxpayers is that neither the $40 billion-plus in new SDRs nor the $100 billion for the NAB
will get much democratic scrutiny. Yet they amount to a massive expansion in U.S. foreign aid. We can see
why the G-20 applauded. But this is the opposite of the "transparency" this Administration has promised, and
someone on Capitol Hill should blow the whistle.

Platinum's Outlook Isn't Gold-Plated
Stumbling from the wreckage of a car crash, platinum bulls hope the humble individual investor will offer
solace.
ETF Securities has filed with regulators to create the U.S.'s first exchange-traded fund backed by physical
platinum. "Physical" ETFs create extra demand for metals because every share must have a corresponding
quantity of the metal behind it.
Since the filing, platinum has risen 5%. It is up 51% since its November trough, after prices collapsed amid
declines in vehicle sales. Catalytic converters for autos account for about 55% of the world's annual platinum
demand.
When ETF Securities launched a London-listed fund in 2007, some miners were unhappy. With demand for
platinum just over six million troy ounces last year, according to HSBC, the market is much smaller than those
for gold, 107 million ounces, or silver, at 889 million ounces. Miners feared that by taking metal off the
market, ETFs would send prices rising abnormally, prompting customers to seek alternatives. The long-term
creation of an overhang of idle platinum wasn't appealing either.
Soon after ETF Securities launched its London-listed fund, electricity blackouts in South Africa, a big
producer, disrupted mining and turbocharged platinum prices, making it hard to assess the new fund's impact.
That said, even marginal extra demand can move a market that has been in deficit seven out of the past eight
years and where the average imbalance of supply compared with demand was less than 2%. Investment
demand for platinum in 2007 and 2008 probably accounted for between 2% and 3% of overall demand.
Despite cutbacks announced by miners, a surplus is expected in 2009 and possibly 2010. A new ETF could
take up some of that slack. But investors should beware. Given the debate over the impact of speculation on
raw-materials prices, there is no guarantee regulators will approve the new fund.
Even if it is approved, platinum prices face a bigger headwind. Up to 75% of platinum demand last year came
from automotive and other industrial uses, according to RBC Capital Markets. Neither are likely to ramp up
demand near term.
The other quarter went mostly into jewelry and vaults. Just to keep demand flat, therefore, jewelry and
investment would have to generate three ounces of extra demand for every ounce lost on the industrial side.
Looking ahead, environmental concerns over vehicles have shifted toward limiting carbon emissions, mainly
by raising fuel efficiency. Burning less fuel means less of the particulates trapped by catalytic converters,
moderating demand expectations.
Platinum is sometimes viewed as an alternative to gold, but it is more like a shiny industrial metal. Investors
planning on using it as an inflation hedge should remember there is a recession.

Put BJ's Shares in Your Cart Along Discount Aisle
Shopping clubs are fixtures of suburban routine, but investors stocking up for the recession shouldn't drive
past BJ's Wholesale Club on the way to Costco.
Costco Wholesale's nationwide network helps it outsell competitors, and the market has rewarded it for
drawing more traffic in the economic downturn. But Thursday's March sales figures highlighted a weakness in
Costco's approach.

--- Page 131 ---
Page 131 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Costco's domestic same-store sales, excluding gasoline, rose 3% from a year earlier, while BJ's posted an
8.5% rise. While BJ's and Costco tracked each other closely in same-store sales growth through last spring
and summer, BJ's has outperformed Costco since October, when the economy fell off a cliff.
Both are selling more staple items such as food and batteries, but Costco said more shoppers are passing
over patio furniture and jewelry that don't suit tighter budgets. BJ's may be faring a bit better because it relies
less on those discretionary purchases.
Location is also on BJ's side. Costco's California stores have been hit hard, but BJ's operates exclusively in
the East, where sales have been stronger for both.
Despite the disparity in performance, Costco is trading at 18.1 times analysts' expected earnings for 2009.
BJ's is valued at a multiple of 14.1 times.
Costco already has made price cuts. In the quarter through February, the company said lower prices
accounted for roughly one-fifth of the 26% decline in earnings. More cuts would help support revenue, but put
near-term earnings at risk. True bargains for investors lie elsewhere in the sector.

Taking Stock in Toll's Model
Pulte Homes' acquisition of Centex, a home builder focused on first-time home buyers, raises questions
about one builder that sells largely to the higher end: Toll Brothers.
There is no doubt that Toll's strong balance sheet will help the company weather the downturn. But even after
the market stabilizes and jumbo loans for pricey houses become more available, many buyers are likely to
shun high-end houses.
One reason is that homeowners have lost $5 trillion in equity in their homes since the housing market's peak,
leaving less money for the large down payments typically required for pricey houses.
Another problem: A big driver for housing during the boom was the idea that large houses with fancy
amenities were good investments. But crashing home values may have undermined that conviction.
Toll, of course, has heard such arguments before. It believes American habits won't change.
And it may be right. But CEO Robert Toll sold about one million shares last month, far outpacing recent
insider sales at other builders. The company's explanation is that Mr. Toll, the builder's biggest shareholder
who controls about 22 million shares after the sale, is seeking to reduce the amount of his family's wealth tied
up in the company.
Still, a big executive stock sale doesn't inspire confidence in Toll's underlying business.

Ratings Game
Gets Face-Lift;
Will Markets?
It seems regulatory revamps and market overhauls don't always go hand in hand.
Everyone from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to Goldman Sachs Group Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein says
that the market relied too heavily on credit-ratings firms that missed risks in bonds backed by bundles of
loans made to consumers.
The Securities and Exchange Commission in December introduced regulations, which took effect Friday, that
require credit-rating firms to keep better records, avoid conflicts of interest and provide more-thorough
reporting of processes.
The rules require the agencies to disclose better how their ratings of asset-backed securities take into
account the financial strength of the lender that made the original loans behind the securities. This could
make it harder for many newly created asset-backed securities to win the coveted triple-A status, says Lisa
Jacobs, a partner at law firm Shearman &Sterling.

--- Page 132 ---
Page 132 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The change makes sense. During the credit boom, ratings-firm analysts failed to detect many of the
compensation incentives and lending practices that helped create the wave of defaults and delinquencies on
consumer loans.
The requirement could trip up efforts to revive lending. The Fed is requiring the triple-A rating for
asset-backed securities it takes as collateral for its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. To get
around the problem, the Fed could take on debt rated below triple-A. But that would be a gamble that could
expose taxpayers to losses.
Let's hope the new regulations don't rain too hard on the credit markets' recent modest improvements.

Heartwarming, or a sell signal? This Monday, a troop of Girl Scouts will ring the opening bell at the New York

Up and down the country, the Scouts' cookies are a springtime staple of comfort-eating habits. And the $700
million they raise from selling the likes of Thin Mints and Samoas offers a crumb of comfort that at least
someone deserving is making money these days. In these troubled times, though, there's no escaping that
hint of dread in the Scouts' motto: Be prepared.

Gold Tumbles 2.7% As Optimism Grows

Gold Tumbles 2.7% As Optimism Grows

Gold futures sank sharply as speculators sold, participants booked profits and general investor sentiment
soured as the U.S. dollar rose and economic optimism grew after a G-20 meeting where International
Monetary Fund gold sales were discussed.
The thinly traded nearby April gold contract lost $24.10, or 2.7%, to settle at $871.50 an ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the weakest front-month settlement since Jan. 22. The
most-active June gold contract fell $24.50 to $872.80.
"The investor interest seems to be waning in gold," said Michael Gross, broker and futures analyst with
OptionSellers.com. Participants are more optimistic about an economic recovery after the Group of 20
summit of world leaders, Mr. Gross said. Talk of IMF gold sales stemming from that meeting also pressured
gold a bit, he said.
The G-20's concluding statement last week said the IMF is going to raise $50 billion for low-income countries,
and part of that money is proposed to come from IMF gold sales. IMF Managing Director Dominique
Strauss-Kahn said the sales refer to the 403.3 metric tons already under discussion and still subject to U.S.
congressional approval. No further sales were planned, he said.
Nevertheless, gold has suffered from concerns the IMF proposal would depress prices. Talk of IMF sales
"might have spooked some of the funds to unload," said Pat Donnelly, senior broker at Peak Trading Group.
After the specter of the sales pushed the metal below $890, gold extended its losses as technical sell stops
were hit, said Ralph Preston, senior market analyst with Heritage West Financial, in a "cascading effect."
Gold was "driven lower by sellers who witnessed its lack of reaction to [North Korea's weekend] missile
launch and by others who see additional gold making its way into the markets from the IMF's and others'
official coffers," Kitco Bullion Dealers analyst Jon Nadler said in a research note.
Although there is a psychological impact from the proposed IMF sales, "this return to more moderate values
is more about the shifting of the tectonic plates which have had the credit and economic lands of the planet
locked since 2007," Mr. Nadler said.
"The fallout of the G-20 meeting . . . is being measured in terms of degrees of optimism," he said. "The metal
thus found itself at a 2 1/2-month low, as the premium placed upon it during the early part of 2009 by
safe-haven motive-driven buyers cracked and peeled off, dollar by dollar."
In other commodities markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures fell for a second session in a row, squeezed by negative stock-market sentiment and a
stronger dollar. Many analysts are expecting another increase in U.S. crude-oil stockpiles in data to be
released this week. Light, sweet crude oil for May delivery settled $1.46, or 2.8%, lower at $51.05 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
NATURAL GAS: Futures fell, tracking a drop in crude oil, as ample supplies of gas and forecasts of mild
weather kept downward pressure on prices. Natural gas for May delivery on the Nymex sank 6.9 cents, or
1.8%, to $3.732 a million British thermal units after falling as low as $3.661.

In this column, we answer your questions about alternative investments. Send them to reports@wsj.com.
Q: As governments and central banks around the globe spend money and lower interest rates to alleviate
economic problems, should an investor prepare for inflation that could be a few years away? What's the best
way to do that?
A: Most analysts expect inflation to perk up at some point, but it's not clear when, presenting difficulties for
investors. Indeed, if markets and economies get worse, deflation -- a broad, extended decline in prices --
could result, rather than inflation. Still, assuming things stabilize in the next year, with governments and
central banks taking unprecedented steps to pump money into their economies, inflation could become a
concern in 2010 or 2011, some analysts say.
To protect a portfolio, Matthew Tuttle, president of Tuttle Wealth Management LLC in Stamford, Conn.,
recommends Treasury inflation-protected securities, known as TIPS, along with oil-related investments and
real estate.
Gold also could do well if inflation accelerates, says Jason DeSena Trennert of New York-based Strategas
Research Partners LLC. Exchange-traded funds, such as SPDR Gold Trust, are one way to play gold,
though some say the best risk-return proposition is out-of-the-money stock options on gold ETFs -- options
that give the holder the right to buy the ETFs at prices well above current levels.
Mr. Tuttle warns investors not to overreact and shift too much of their portfolio around, but rather to wait for
incipient signs that inflation is perking up. "If you start investing in these areas now, you could potentially
suffer years of losses before this scenario comes to be," he says.
Q: Hedge funds have been somewhat disappointing, but CTAs are doing better, I believe. What are they and
can an individual access them?
A: CTAs, or commodity-trading advisers, run funds focused on commodities, currencies and derivatives, often
using futures and options. CTAs are close cousins of hedge funds and are regulated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, notes Drew Chapman of law firm DLA
Piper.
CTAs generally focus on markets that have a lot of daily trading. For investors, that's an advantage over
hedge funds, some of which have frozen their clients' accounts as certain debt assets the funds hold have
become harder to trade.
Returns on investments with CTAs aren't closely correlated with movements in the broad stock market, at
least over an extended period, which is a big plus for investors looking to balance their portfolios. But they
can be quite volatile because price movements in the markets CTAs invest in can be more irregular than
those in stocks.
Investors can access CTAs directly or through so-called funds of funds -- funds that invest in other funds, in
this case in CTA funds -- though these charge an extra layer of fees on top of those charged by a CTA. There
often are asset, income and minimum-balance requirements for individual CTA accounts that can be steep.
Individuals can learn more and check for complaints levied against CTAs at the Web site of the National
Futures Association, www.nfa.futures.org.
Lee Schultheis, chief investment strategist and founder of AIP Funds, warns that CTAs "tend to get beat up
the most at key turns of the market," so they should be avoided if an investor believes that stocks have
bottomed.

--- Page 137 ---
Page 137 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
David Hefty, CEO of Cornerstone Wealth Management in Auburn, Ind., says as long as a CTA is fully vetted
by a financial adviser and the risks are understood, "we think this type of strategy can provide portfolios
protection and uncorrelated returns, and utilize them in our portfolios."
Some advisers also recommend two open-end mutual funds, the Rydex Managed Futures fund and the
Direxion Commodity Trends Strategy fund, that use strategies similar to those of CTAs by buying and selling
exchange-traded funds. Over the past year, the funds have fallen only a bit.
Q: Does it make sense to buy closed-end mutual funds that trade at deep discounts? Is that a good
investment for an average investor looking to diversify?
A: Some closed-end funds, or funds that issue a set number of shares, do trade at a discount to the value of
their holdings, potentially creating an opportunity. But that's because of the risks inherent in their portfolios.
Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, notes that
many closed-end funds trading at deep discounts invest borrowed money, adding to their danger. Some buy
interests in companies acquired in leveraged buyouts, making it hard to assess their value. But if the markets
continue to rebound, the discount between the price of a fund and the value of its holdings likely will shrink or
disappear, notes Jeff Fishman of JSF Financial LLC.
"At some point, closed-end funds could provide great bargains," says Mr. Tuttle of Tuttle Wealth
Management. "If you believe that this current crisis is over, then these could be great investments."

Gold Prices Poised to Weather IMF Sales

Gold Prices Poised to Weather IMF Sales

LONDON -- Gold sales by the International Monetary Fund are unlikely to depress the metal's price because
central banks would be likely buyers.
The concluding statement from the Group of 20 industrial and developing nations last week said the IMF will
raise $50 billion for aid to the poorest countries, with part of that money expected to come from IMF gold
sales.
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said the sales refer to the 403.3 metric tons already under
discussion and still subject to U.S. congressional approval. No further sales were planned, he said.
Gold prices initially fell 3.5%, dipping below $900 a troy ounce, on Thursday's statement. Analysts said that if
the sales go forward, they would be slow, orderly and absorbed by central banks. Friday, nearby April gold
fell $11.80, or 1.3%, to $895.60 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
"Central banks such as those in China, Russia and Japan are obvious counterparties to this kind of sale,"
said Morgan Stanley analyst Hussein Allidina.
Mr. Allidina said those central banks could diversify their large dollar holdings and buy IMF gold off-market,
limiting the effect on gold prices on the spot and Comex markets.
The IMF has in the past sold gold to members off-market. In 1999 and 2000, the IMF sold 12.9 million
ounces to Mexico and Brazil in authorized off-market transactions, some of which was sold back to the IMF.
The IMF has 3,217 metric tons of gold reserves, making it the world's third-largest official holder of gold
behind Germany and the U.S.
Like the U.S. and the Bank for International Settlements, the IMF follows the Central Bank Gold Agreement,
a pact agreed to by 17 European central banks to sell no more than 500 tons of gold each year to pact
members. The five-year agreement ends Sept. 26, and analysts expect a new one to be negotiated.
Before any IMF sale happens, 85% of the fund's shareholders need to approve the proposal. Since the U.S.
has 17% of the votes, it has a de facto veto over the proposal.
There are strict rules over how gold would be sold by the IMF. On its Web site, the IMF said approval would
be granted only if the sale could be conducted in a way to minimize disruption to the gold market.
"The market managed to absorb [Central Bank Gold Agreement] sales and still move higher," said Philip
Klapwijk, head of GFMS Metals Consulting in the U.K.
European countries that are signatories to the agreement have sold 80 metric tons of gold since the end of
September, according to data in March.
"IMF sales don't necessarily mean trouble as long as investors continue to buy. It could also be attractive to
central banks with large U.S. dollar holdings," Mr. Klapwijk said.
Recent data for central bank gold holdings from the World Gold Council show there is interest among
central banks to increase the percentage of gold in their foreign reserves.
In the first quarter, Russia's gold holdings rose by 29.8 tons, to 523.7 tons. Gold accounts for 4% of the
country's total foreign reserves, up from 2.2% at the end of 2008, the data show.
Alexei Ulyukayev, first deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia, said in February the bank plans to continue
buying gold to increase the proportion of reserves held in the metal.

Ecuador's gold holdings more than doubled in the first quarter, reaching 54.7 tons from 26.3 tons at the end
of 2008. Gold as a percentage of foreign reserves rose to 32%, from 9.8%.
Venezuela's gold holdings rose to 363.9 tons from 356.4 tons in the same period, and to 36% of its total
foreign reserves from 23%, the data showed.

Crude Settles Over $50 a Barrel

Crude Settles Over $50 a Barrel

Crude-oil futures zoomed back above $50 a barrel as traders responded to hopes that demand will firm up if
the world economy does.
Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled $4.25, or 8.8%, higher at $52.64 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
The Nymex close was the highest in a week. Oil started the day trading strongly in sympathy with rising world
stock markets and was further fueled by optimism arising from the Group of 20 nations' agreement to raise
the International Monetary Fund's lending powers by more than $1 trillion.
"We came in this morning, and stock markets around the world were up," said Chris Mennis, president of
New Wave Energy, a brokerage firm in Aptos, Calif. "There's a growing consensus the economy and the
stock market have seen its worst."
Oil's rebound came amid new signs that supply is more in line with demand, which has been pinched by the
economic slowdown. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has announced production cuts
totaling 4.2 million barrels a day since September.
Oil Movements, a firm that tracks tanker traffic, said oil exports from the 10 major OPEC members that it
watches will in April likely drop by nearly a million barrels a day to 22.15 million barrels a day, the lowest level
in nearly six years.
Roy Mason, head of Oil Movements, said the numbers pointed to 80% compliance with agreed-on OPEC
cuts. A separate Dow Jones Newswires survey indicated that OPEC last month was 83%-compliant with its
announced reductions, an improvement on a month earlier.
"We think the oil market is pretty much in balance at this precise moment," said Lawrence Eagles, commodity
research head at J.P. Morgan Chase. "Although we've seen quite a dramatic downward shift in demand,
we've also seen quite a dramatic shift in OPEC supply cuts."
In other commodities trading:
GOLD: Futures fell largely in reaction to strong equities, which meant further unwinding of safe-haven
positions in gold. "As fear goes down, gold goes down with it," said Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector
Asset Management. The nearby April gold contract lost $18.70 to $907.40 an ounce on the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the most-active June gold contract dropped $18.80 to $908.90.
SOYBEANS: Prices climbed on broad speculative buying associated with economic optimism and strong
export demand. The May soybean contract on the Chicago Board of Trade increased 25 cents to $9.77 a
bushel.

Stocks Leap as Fears Ebb --- Investors Show Stomach for Risk on European Rate Cut, U.S. Accounting Rule Changes
Stocks Leap as Fears Ebb --- Investors Show Stomach for Risk on European Rate Cut, U.S.
Accounting Rule Changes

A wave of stock buying swept across the globe, as upbeat economic news from China, an interest-rate cut in
Europe and a change in U.S. accounting rules spurred new investor appetite for risk.
In London, the heads of the world's leading economies concluded their summit with agreement on extra
support for the International Monetary Fund, tighter global regulation of hedge funds, and widespread
expressions of optimism that the worst of the economic downturn might be over. President Barack Obama
hailed the Group of 20 meeting as a "turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery." But he
cautioned, "There are no guarantees."
Investors weren't waiting for guarantees. They were grasping at any shred of evidence that the world's
economy is improving, or at least getting less bad. Betting that a recovery will start later this year, they were
buying oil futures, industrial commodities, technology stocks and junk bonds, investments they shunned just a
few weeks ago. They were selling Treasury bonds, gold, the dollar and other safe-haven refuges.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged above 8000 during the day for the first time since February, though
late-day selling pulled the Dow lower at the close. While plenty of skeptics remain, the blue chips still finished
at their highest level since Feb. 9, up 216.48 points, or 2.79%, at 7978.08.
The advance began in Asia, where a report showed China's manufacturing sector growing again. Japanese
stocks jumped 4.4% and in Hong Kong they were up 7.4%. Stocks in Tokyo rose 0.6% in midday trading
Friday.
Gains were even stronger in Europe, as the European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate and
indicated it is considering more aggressive steps to stimulate the economy. On top of that, the G-20 agreed
on a series of measures, such as quadrupling lending power at the IMF, aimed at boosting global growth.
German stocks jumped 6.1%, and French stocks rose 5.4%.
The G-20 leaders increased the financial capacity of the IMF to $1 trillion so the fund can better handle crises
in troubled countries -- hoping to send a signal to markets that the fund had adequate resources to handle a
further downturn in the economy. The group also committed itself to revamping regulation of systemically
important financial institutions, including hedge funds, and kept open the possibility that the nations would
boost fiscal spending further.
Additionally, the leaders said they intended to begin a broad crackdown on tax havens.
In the U.S., accounting standards were changed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a private
group that sets U.S. standards. The changes relaxed rules on how banks value billions of dollars in troubled
securities, helping them strengthen their balance sheets and lend more. While conservative accountants
warned that this was hocus-pocus that would cause trouble later, optimists said it could further stimulate
recovery.
The Dow industrials are up 20% in the past four calendar weeks. If the industrials don't give ground Friday, it
will mark their strongest four-week gain since 1938. In all, the blue chips are up 21.9% since hitting a 12-year
low on March 9, although they still are down 44% from their 2007 record finish.
Buying of technology stocks lifted the Nasdaq Composite Index 3.3%. The index is now up 1.6% for the year.
"In the economy, we are seeing a host of statistics that suggest that things are at least a little bit better at the
margin. Most of them are still showing signs of decline, but just not as fast as it was. That is usually the first
sign of stabilization," said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee $22 billion as head of the investment strategy
team at Cleveland's Key Private Bank, an arm of KeyCorp.

Among the recent data that have been, if not positive, at least better than expected, Mr. McCain cites: auto
sales, pending home sales, manufacturing activity, durable-goods orders, retail sales, consumer spending,
consumer confidence, existing-home sales, housing starts and permits for new-home construction. Mr.
McCain's portfolio managers had been leaning heavily toward stable, defensive investments such as
health-care stocks and Treasury bonds. Lately, they have been shifting money toward developing-country
stocks and industrial commodities.
Investors broadly are buying volatile consumer-dependent stocks such as Home Depot Inc., General Motors
Corp. and Citigroup Inc., which rose on Thursday, and selling more-stable stocks such as Johnson &Johnson,
Pfizer Inc. and Altria Group Inc., all of which fell.
They are buying junk bonds and selling safer Treasury bonds. They are selling gold and the dollar, viewed as
refuges in troubled times, and buying oil, copper and other industrial commodities. They are buying stocks of
minerals-exporting countries such as Brazil and Australia, both of which were up strongly.
In another sign of risk appetite, one of the first protective programs set up by the Federal Reserve after the
collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. last year received no bids at a regular auction. The program, in which banks
exchange riskier, and less sellable, securities for Treasurys, helped give the firms much-needed financing,
and ultimately cash, during the crisis. The lack of interest on Thursday was a sign to some that money is
moving more freely around the system.
Plenty of investors still have reservations about all this risk taking, for fear that the economy will prove weaker
than the optimists hope.
Although he is doing some buying, Mr. McCain still is limiting stocks in his average portfolio to just 60%, with
10% in cash and most of the rest in bonds. "There are pretty good odds that the market will sell off at some
point" later this year, he says.
Gordon Fowler, who helps manage $16 billion as chief investment officer at Philadelphia money-management
firm Glenmede Trust, is remaining conservative. He is holding clients' stock exposure below normal and
exposure to high-grade corporate bonds above normal, and he isn't joining in the recent shift toward risky
purchases.
"We are in for rough, volatile times," he says. Since the beginning of March, for example, the Dow has had
seven triple-digit point gains and six triple-digit point losses.
With retirement savings way down, consumers are more likely to hoard their cash than spend it, Mr. Fowler
says. That kind of retrenchment by consumers and companies is likely to hobble economic growth, he says.
"We are just as likely to see a stock decline over the next month or so as an increase. It is quite possible that
we will get into the 700s again" on the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index, which finished Thursday ahead
2.9% at 834.38.

Quarterly Markets Review: Gold Retains Its Allure --- Policy-Fueled Gains Rekindle Beaten-Down Commodities

It appeared that big declines in commodities prices finally may have run their course as the first quarter came
to an end. But whether it can be a sustained rally could depend on the prospects for a quick economic
turnaround.
The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index, after falling more than 50% in last year's second half, continued to
slide at the start of 2009 as the global economy kept contracting. It was down 13% through March 2, before
the U.S. government's aggressive plans to stimulate the economy and bolster the financial system helped
rekindle depressed markets for hard assets. Escalating fears of inflation and production cuts also contributed
to late-quarter gains.
Initial enthusiasm faded in light of mounting evidence of economic weakness. The index ended the first
quarter down 6.4%.
Gold, traditionally viewed as the ultimate safe haven in troubled times, was the hot commodity throughout
the quarter. Hedge funds, pension plans and jittery individuals poured billions of dollars into the yellow metal
as recession gripped the world. Gold gained 4.4% in the first quarter, to $922.60 a troy ounce, and at one
point came within sight of its March 2008 record of $1,003.20. Silver, which usually is more volatile than gold,
soared 15% after big declines last year.
Many commodities that took a beating last year posted eye-popping gains, albeit from a low base. Crude oil
rose 11% to $49.66 a barrel, and gasoline futures jumped 39%. Copper gained 32%.
Agricultural products fell in the face of weaker demand and bigger crops around the world: corn fell 0.6%,
soybeans gave up 2.1%, and wheat skidded 13%.
"Stimulus spending will eventually lead to a rebound in commodities," said Theresa Gusman, head of global
commodities at DB Advisors, the asset-management arm of Deutsche Bank. "We think 2009 will be a mirror
image of 2008." She noted that some commodities have already started to come back.
Other analysts aren't convinced that this policy-fueled rally can continue for long. A solid recovery in
commodities, they say, will require a pickup in industrial production. Even with all of the rescue plans in place,
it takes time for credit markets to thaw and revive real economic activity.
"Such rallies will be fragile until government measures gain traction in supporting demand, thereby providing
a solid base for recovery," Barclays Capital analysts wrote in a recent report.
The overall economic picture still looks bleak. In January, the International Monetary Fund sharply cut its
forecast for global growth this year to 0.5%, the weakest since World War II and down from its November
estimate of 2.2%. Slower economic expansion means less demand for energy, metals and agricultural
products. In its March report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration lowered its expectations for this
year's global oil consumption to 84.27 million barrels a day, a drop of 1.4 million barrels from 2008.
"Many commodities have started to carve out their trading ranges, and we'll start to see sideways movements
for much of this year," said Edward Meir, a commodities analyst at MF Global. "I wouldn't break out the
champagne yet."
Still, there are factors that could contribute to further gains. The credit crunch has hampered mining
companies' ability to open new mines. Cuts in production of oil and some base metals will affect supplies,
which reduces the downside risk in many commodities prices.
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have implemented reductions of 4.2 million
barrels a day, or 5% of the world's total supply, about 80% of the group's pledged reductions. As oil fell below

$50 a barrel early in the quarter, the surprisingly high compliance helped stem the drop in prices. At its March
meeting, OPEC decided not to seek a new cut in production targets, fearing that higher oil prices might hurt
the vulnerable global economy and affect demand.
Among metals, aluminum and nickel saw the biggest production cuts in the first quarter, according to a Credit
Suisse report, with mine closures accounting for 13% and 17% of their global supplies, respectively.
Future supplies also are at stake, as many producers aggressively scaled back their capital expenditures. In
the U.S. alone, energy exploration and production spending is estimated to drop $22.5 billion this year, a 40%
year-on-year decline, said Ms. Gusman at Deutsche Bank.
"Every day, the depletion argument [for further price gains] becomes more powerful," said Derek van Eck,
who manages Van Eck Global Hard Assets Fund.
Massive stockpiling of commodities by China, a cash-rich but resource-hungry country, also has pushed up
prices. In recent months, Beijing has been snapping up commodities it lacks, such as copper, oil and
soybeans, and recently said it would spend an extra $10 billion to bulk up its commodity inventories, a 60%
rise from its original plan.
But some analysts warn that the hoarding isn't real demand and can quickly turn around if prices rise enough
that Beijing starts to use the reserves instead of buying more in the market.
Meanwhile, commodity investors have become more discerning about which commodities they buy. In
contrast with prior years' heady influx into broad index funds as prices soared, exchange-traded products that
track precious metals and energy accounted for nearly all of the net inflows in the latest quarter, said Kevin
Norrish, a commodities analyst at Barclays Capital.
"There are a lot of different and diverging trends between different commodities," Mr. Norrish said. "Investors
are seeking more active strategies with a greater focus on individual commodity markets."
One example: As oil prices rose, higher storage levels, faltering heating demand and the risk of more
liquefied-natural-gas imports put downward pressure on natural-gas prices, which closed the quarter with a
33% drop.

Crude Slips Below $50 a Barrel

Crude Slips Below $50 a Barrel

NEW YORK -- Rising crude-oil inventories and weak demand can only be ignored for so long.
Oil prices dipped back to end below $50 a barrel Monday, as the rally that carried futures to a four-month high
above $54 a barrel last week skidded to a halt. A weaker dollar had temporarily enticed investors, more
concerned about managing their exposure to inflation than about U.S. crude stockpiles at a 16-year high.
Meanwhile, surging stocks reflected hope that an economic recovery could come sooner than expected,
helping to boost global oil demand.
Both the dollar and stocks reversed course Monday on uncertainty about European economies and the
prospect of U.S. auto makers filing for bankruptcy protection. Manufacturing and employment data due this
week also could put a damper on rebound hopes.
In the oil market, weak demand has resulted in a supply overhang, dooming potential rallies.
Light, sweet crude oil for May delivery settled $3.97, or 7.6%, lower at $48.41 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
"No one who was buying was really buying based on belief," that oil supplies were tightening, said Stephen
Schork, editor of the Schork Report.
Oil prices had generally stayed between $35 and $45 a barrel since the end of 2008. But the market broke
out on March 19, the day after the Federal Reserve said it would spend $1 trillion to support the financial
sector. Oil prices topped $50 a barrel for the first time since early January, and settled above that level for
seven consecutive sessions.
Then stocks took over, surging on promising economic indicators as well as the potential for additional federal
aid for banks. The prospect of the U.S. economy, the world's biggest oil consumer, reaching a turning point
helped fuel gains for crude futures.
In other commodity markets on Monday:
PLATINUM: Prices fell partly due to weakness in gold and also because of troubles in the auto sector,
especially with the Obama administration taking a hard line with car makers, analysts said. Platinum is used
in catalytic converters. Nearby April platinum lost $14.40, or 1.3%, to $1,113.60 a troy ounce on the Nymex,
while most-active July fell $16.90, or 1.5%, to $1,120.80.
COPPER: Futures dropped as the dollar rose, oil sank and profit-taking in the metal tracked that in stocks.
Copper for April delivery fell 7.3 cents, or 4%, to settle at $1.7610 a pound on the Comex division of the
Nymex, while the most-active May contract lost seven cents, to $1.7660 a pound.

Dethroning the Dollar: What If?

Dethroning the Dollar: What If?

There could be far-reaching implications for commodities should the U.S. dollar lose its status as the world's
reserve currency.
While such a move could mean more demand for commodities as a hard asset, or "store of value," if there
were a general distrust of all currencies, there are differing views on whether it would mean less
currency-related fluctuations in pricing of commodities and just what the impact might be on producers
around the globe.
It also would remain to be seen whether the world would go to the International Monetary Fund's Special
Drawing Rights program -- a reserve asset based on the value of a basket of four currencies -- and whether
commodity exchanges would automatically follow suit.
Last Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner prompted a drop in the dollar when he suggested the
U.S. would be "open" to an expansion of the IMF's SDR program, a move China had suggested two days
prior. The market initially treated this as consideration for a new global reserve currency, but the greenback
quickly recovered as the foreign-exchange market soon dismissed the remark as a misstep. Mr. Geithner
himself maintained the dollar would remain the world's dominant currency.
Still, it raises the question of what might happen to commodities if the dollar was no longer king, even though
some commodity analysts, such as Logic Advisors principal Bill O'Neill, describe the question as academic
more than anything.
"This is an extremely hypothetical situation," said Sterling Smith, vice president with FuturesOne. "I'm not
entirely sure it would work all that well."
Commodities such as oil are traded in dollars not only in the U.S. but also on some of the other major
exchanges in the world, such as London. This means potential for changes in the supply-demand dynamics
whenever the dollar makes a big move. For instance, a weak dollar tends to support commodities by making
them cheaper in other currencies and theoretically improving demand, and vice versa.
If the dollar were to be displaced in favor of a basket of currencies, it would make foreign-exchange
considerations less of a factor in pricing, Mr. Smith said, and could mean uniform pricing on global
exchanges. However, he said, exchanges likely would oppose that because it would take away arbitrage
business -- the ability to profit over price differences -- as well as currency loyalty from customers wanting to
buy or sell in home currencies.
But others, such as CPM Group precious-metals analyst Carlos Sanchez, doubted any kind of new dominant
currency would remove currency fluctuations from commodities pricing.
"Everything would be priced in SDRs," Mr. Sanchez said. "There would still be arbitrage opportunities. It
would just be treated like another currency."
There are also differing views on the impact a shift away from the dollar would have on commodity producers
globally.
Mr. Sanchez suggested this would be negligible, saying the process would be slow and governments would
want to make the transition smooth and the new currency system as free-floating as possible. Cash costs for
producers would be priced in SDRs instead of dollars, he said.
However, Shawn Hackett, president of Hackett Financial Advisors, cautioned that conditions could be "very
chaotic for a while" after any change.

For starters, overseas producers wouldn't want to sell, say, corn in depreciating dollars since profitability
would suffer.
For U.S. producers, a change and ensuing weaker dollar might mean farmers would get higher prices for
corn. But it also might end up not helping them for long since the reduced purchasing power of the dollar
means other products would also be far more expensive, he said.
If the dollar lost its reserve status, gold's value would likely rise, analysts said. The metal's price is driven in
part by investor demand, and in addition to buying gold as an inflation hedge, many also purchase it as an
alternative currency.

Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- No Easy Answers: Three finance experts on mark-to-market
accounting, foreclosure protection and China's economic warnings

Regulators, investors and taxpayers are trying to get a handle on a range of perplexing economic issues.
Should financial institutions value the holdings on their books according to fair market value (known as
mark-to-market accounting)? How should the administration protect homeowners from foreclosure? And what
should we make of China issuing economic warnings?
For some insight, The Wall Street Journal's Paul Gigot spoke with three prominent experts in finance: James
S. Chanos, founder and president of Kynikos Associates; Stephen A. Schwarzman, chairman, chief executive
and co-founder of Blackstone Group; and Robert J. Shiller, professor of economics at Yale University. Here
are edited excerpts from the discussion.
PAUL GIGOT: Steve, you've argued that fair-value, or mark-to-market, accounting is a major culprit in the
financial meltdown. Why do you think that is the case?
STEPHEN A. SCHWARZMAN: I think there are a lot of complex reasons for this crisis, one of which I believe
is the accounting system that we use that's exacerbating the crisis and forcing companies, and particularly
financial institutions, to mark down certain securities in markets that are not very liquid in sort of very large
hits.
This has destroyed capital, that then makes it impossible for the institutions to lend money, and it also creates
a problem of confidence in the system.
So, it's pretty clear to me that for the good of the system you cannot allow that mark to occur the way it is.
Imagine trying to run a bank. If you make a loan in the old world, the way a lot of us grew up, and you didn't
think it was impaired, you kept it on your books at par. Now, if loans are trading at $70, you make that loan,
you lose $30 just for making the loan. Well, what would any rational person do? They would not make a loan,
and you can't blame them.
And so, even though there is a lot to be said for complete mark-to-market in a system that can take it, I don't
believe that the financial system, as currently organized with its current rules, can really take the full hit of it.
MR. GIGOT: If one of the problems, though, in the current moment is that nobody trusts the books, how does
waiving the rules in the middle of a crisis get people to trust the books?
MR. SCHWARZMAN: With the current system, nobody believes the number [that financial institutions use for
the fair-market value of the holdings on their books]. So, my argument would be that the current system
clearly doesn't work since nobody believes the number, that this must not be the right way to go because it
clearly doesn't work.
JAMES S. CHANOS: I have a few minor disagreements. I'll start with my own anecdote, and that is when
Lehman Brothers collapsed, we had an auction in their credit-default swaps to see where the writers of those
insurance policies would have to pay out, and it turns out they had to pay out 91 cents on the dollar. And that
equates roughly, right now, I think Lehman's funded debt is trading somewhere around 15 cents on the dollar
after a rally recently.
To give you an idea of what that means, Lehman had about $150 billion that those CDS contracts covered,
their notes and bonds, but not their bank debt, of course, or their repo. There was also about $25 billion of
equity, roughly, in common and preferred at Lehman, which we would therefore value at zero.
So what that tells us, back of the envelope, in somewhat anecdotal form, is that the hole in the Lehman
Brothers balance sheet, give or take today and back in October, is about $150 billion. To put that in
perspective, the hole in Enron, when the dust settled, when all the claims were paid, was about $60 billion or
$70 billion. So, Lehman is more than twice Enron on a current-snapshot basis.

Now, we can talk about a billion here, a billion there and being off a little bit on what we're supposed to be
doing, but I would pose to you that right now the surprises have been and will continue to be on the downside
where management has the latitude to mark this stuff. And I think a central tenet of what you're saying is that
you believe that a lot of this stuff is undervalued on bank balance sheets.
MR. SCHWARZMAN: I believe a lot of this stuff is impossible to know what it's really worth.
MR. CHANOS: We're looking at this through the wrong end of the telescope. Don't disabuse the notions of
fair-value accounting and better transparency in the interests of regulatory relief, particularly if it's
countercyclical. Simply grant them regulatory relief. We can grant regulatory relief on a temporary basis
without compromising the integrity of the financial statements of all financial institutions.
MR. GIGOT: Bob, you want to get in on this?
ROBERT J. SHILLER: The first thing is to make sure that we preserve the integrity of our accounting. People
know that this country stands for high integrity, and so anything that looks like we're allowing people to doctor
the books, I think we shouldn't do that.
We should keep mark-to-market accounting, and we should work toward a countercyclical capital-standards
system that gives relief, and it should be automatic at times of crisis like this.
MR. GIGOT: Could Congress or the Financial Accounting Standards Board do something to ease the current
problem by easing mark-to-market requirements?
MR. SHILLER: That's analogous to taking back the AIG bonuses. It's something that people all over the world
will notice and think that we're losing our integrity. I just don't think we can go that way.
MR. GIGOT: Bob, since you have an expertise about many things but in particular housing, can you talk a
little bit about whether the foreclosure mitigation that the administration is proposing is going to make a
difference and is a good idea.
MR. SHILLER: I'm very glad that the administration is doing this, because I think it's the core problem that
hasn't been addressed. But I would say that the more fundamental problem which should be addressed in the
longer run is that we have a system that encourages homeowners to take leveraged, risky positions with all of
their wealth in real estate in one city. And it kind of amazes me to look back and try to put myself in the
mind-set of a couple of years ago.
Why were we telling people to do that? And now, according to Economy.com, we have more than 12 million
homeowners who are underwater, and for a good share of them, that's all they have. They've been wiped out,
and yet they were following the advice of -- it's hard to believe how we could think that. I have a proposal that
we should change our mortgage institution so that it helps the people. We should have a mortgage that
includes, tacked onto it, some kind of home-equity insurance so that they don't get wiped out. And people
used to tell me, you don't need that, because people are already in the optimal position in their portfolio, and I
couldn't understand. How can it be optimal if you have all of your life savings in this one leveraged
investment? And now we know it wasn't optimal.
MR. GIGOT: Isn't the danger, though, with foreclosure mitigation, that you will prevent the natural bottoming
of home prices? As hard as it is on some people, for the larger society, the faster you find a bottom, the
sooner we can write off the losses and then start anew.
MR. SHILLER: I would like foreclosure mitigation to have the same form that it did in the Roosevelt
administration. What the Roosevelt administration did when it created the Home Owner's Loan Corp. in 1933
is it instituted the long-term mortgage. Back then, the problem was that you had to roll your mortgage every
three to five years. And so they created a whole change in standards.
That's what I would like to see now happen. I wish the president's program had gone beyond a bailout into
something more inspiring, that we are going to fix the system.
MR. GIGOT: Let me raise another issue which is much in the news, and that is this question of just how much
the federal government can spend, borrow, guarantee, before the rest of the world decides that it may pull our
credit card, and whether or not there are limits to the national balance sheet. We saw yesterday the latest
proposal from the Chinese that they think the dollar has seen its final days as a reserve currency, and they
want a replacement.
MR. SCHWARZMAN: I think the Chinese have been pretty open, that they've had people speaking who are
concerned just about the concentration of the consumer economy and magnitude of deficits and wanting to,
over time, rebalance their liquid exposure to the dollar. They've made it very clear that they don't want to do

--- Page 153 ---
Page 153 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
anything over the short term that would destabilize the current situation further, and that's a very, very
important thing to them.
But somewhere between the short and the long term, they've said quite publicly they'd like to have less
exposure to the dollar unless we change the character of our economy, which I assume to mean have more
savings, less deficits and normal, sound economic planning. I don't think there's more to it than that.
MR. CHANOS: I'm not an international-finance expert, but looking at it domestically through the prism of a
money manager, I would simply say that it seems to me that the only way in which we're moving capital
forward is with some sort of government assistance or guarantee. If it has that, it works. If it doesn't, it
doesn't.
And the private markets are still leery, whether it's due to accounting reasons or broader economic reasons,
whatever they are, of dealing on its own without government assistance, and that's kind of a scary situation
over the intermediate and long term because what happens when government inevitably has to pull back
from some of those measures, whether voluntarily or involuntarily?
The only other thing I would say is I thought that the pronouncement by the Chinese Sunday night was -- they
rarely are that direct. I mean, that's like taking out a billboard in Times Square and saying, get your house in
order; we don't want to hold all your debt.
MR. GIGOT: Are there limits to what we can borrow and maintain our standing as a reserve-currency
country?
MR. SHILLER: Well, unfortunately we have some difficult choices now because I think we need a stimulus
package, and we all agree on that and we have to move forward with that, but the issues that you raise are
important as well. This country has a reputation that's extremely valuable. There is a trust in our debt, and
unfortunately this situation we're in is starting to shake it. And people are rational to have that worry.
I just want to remind you that the U.S. government has defaulted on its debt; I believe the last time was in
1933. They didn't count it as a default. When Roosevelt came in, the first thing he did was go off the gold
standard, and at that time U.S. debt had gold clauses which promised to pay in gold, and kind of unilaterally
he just did it.
And so that is a default. That really was. And it happened in times similar to what we're going through now.
Somehow we've survived. Our reputation remains reasonably good.
MR. GIGOT: Are you saying you want to repeat that experience?
MR. SHILLER: Unfortunately that's what people are worrying about now, and as I say, we have difficult
choices. We don't want to default on the government debt. We want to stay as far away from reminding
people. But this is the dilemma. There's no easy answer, that as the national debt goes up there's going to be
more and more memories coming up of this kind of possibility, or of the possibility of a major inflation that is
deliberately wiping out the debt.

Reflation and How to Exploit It --- Some Bet Commodities Will Boom as Stimulus Restarts Global Economy

Reflation and How to Exploit It --- Some Bet Commodities Will Boom as Stimulus Restarts Global

The most talked-about investing strategy these days isn't stuffing money in a mattress, it's the reflation trade
-- the bet that the world economy will rebound, driving up interest rates and commodities prices.
Even though the economy continues to struggle, investors are looking ahead to time when the massive
rescue efforts by central banks and governments gain traction.
They are focused on raw materials and commodity-related stocks that would benefit from the surge in
infrastructure spending. They are looking to exploit potential bottlenecks in production that could lift prices
and corporate earnings. Some are layering on insurance against a spike in inflation should central banks
lose control of their stimulus efforts.
"Between the bailouts and the stimulus, it's pretty clear that we're going to have some inflation when we get
out of this mess," says Roger Ibbotson, founder of Ibbotson Associates and chairman of hedge-fund manager
Zebra Capital Management. It may not show up for another two years, he says, "but after that I think it's quite
likely and I think you should be positioning a portfolio against that."
Evidence of the trade shows up in higher yields on bonds that adjust for inflation and a surge in prices for
commodities including copper, up 19% in March, zinc and oil.
Shawn Rubin, an adviser at Smith Barney in New York, has moved some clients partly into natural-resources
stocks while using strategies to protect against a spike in inflation.
One way is to use options, where an investor is able to use relatively small amounts of money and take
positions that would profit from a massive drop in Treasury prices or a near doubling in gold prices. While in
the short run such trades may not work, "it's a long-term move," Mr. Rubin says. "You want to buy insurance
when it's cheap."
For now, the U.S. remains in a deflationary mode. The economy is believed to have contracted roughly 5% in
the first quarter. Consumer prices are expected to post a year-to-year drop of 1.3% through June, according
to the latest Wall Street Journal survey of economists.
And despite the recent rally that lifted stocks 20% from their lows as of Thursday -- the common definition of
the return to a bull market, though they promptly fell again Friday -- most investors expect a challenging
environment well into next year.
But the Federal Reserve has taken dramatic steps to revive the economy and stabilize the financial system. It
has lowered interest rates essentially to zero and is on track to pump more than $2 trillion into the credit
markets.
On top of that, there is the $787 billion federal stimulus program coupled with a growing budget deficit.
Around the globe central banks and governments are making similar moves.
Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust, says the Fed will likely err on the side of
ensuring the recovery is sustained "and usually that means they will be late" in turning against inflation. The
"political sentiment will be toward inflation and in preventing deflation," he adds.
Until a few weeks ago, investors weren't even thinking about preparing for a recovery, hoarding cash and
U.S. Treasury bonds and defensive stocks that would perform better than most in a recession. And the longer
the economy takes to rebound, the longer it will take for the so-called reflation trade to pay off. In the
meantime, investors with those bets run the risk of big losses.

"Until real demand recovers, the trade has a chance of getting ahead of itself," says Mark Liinamaa,
natural-resources analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Liinamaa suggests investors keep a "survivor bias." That means "looking for names that have low cost
structures and balance-sheet capacity to still be standing" even if demand doesn't recover soon. He cites
steel producer Nucor as one example.
Already there are signs that the market is less worried about deflation. That's clearest in the market for
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. Back in February, five-year TIPS were priced for a 0.5% drop in
consumer prices, now that's swung around to a 1.35% increase.
The magnitude of the expected inflation rise predicted by TIPS may be small, but the direction tells the tale,
says John Hollyer, a co-manager of Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund.
"The fiscal and monetary stimulus are causing investors to say there's a decent chance the Fed will be
successful and there will be an increase in inflation," he says.
Other markets are yet to reflect a shift toward inflation fears. In the Treasury market, where inflation erodes
the value of the interest payments over time, the 10-year bond is yielding just 2.761%.
But it isn't just the ripples from the money flooding into the financial system that has some looking at a
"reflation" trade. Even if there isn't a strong recovery, the economic collapse has taken substantial amounts of
raw-material production offline.
Reduced inventories could in turn result in price-rise bottlenecks even with just a moderate rebound in
demand from commodity users.
"You could see a reflation in commodity prices even without broad inflation in the overall economy," says
Jason Trennert, chief investment strategist at Strategas Research Partners LLC. He is recommending energy
and materials stocks, as well as an exchange-traded gold fund, to play the reflation trade over the next one
to three years.
The possibility of rising commodity prices without inflation was highlighted last week in a report from
Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimating that half the new oil and gas production that was in the
works is now at risk of being deferred or canceled. While crude-oil prices are still down 64% from their high hit
last summer, they are up 54% from their low hit on Feb. 12 and are up 17% this year.
It isn't just Washington's stimulus that has investors preparing for inflation. For many, the source of potential
capacity constraints could well be China.
"China's stimulus package may be even more important for the inflation trade than what happens in the
U.S." says Mr. Trennert. China pledged to devote nearly 75% of its $586 billion stimulus package to
infrastructure development and reconstruction of an earthquake-stricken area. The U.S. is allocating just $48
billion to direct infrastructure spending.
China's efforts have rippled through to the markets for at least a few metals. Prices for copper, commonly
used in power generation and construction, are up 44% from the low hit in December. Zinc, needed for
producing galvanized steel used by utilities and the auto industry, is up 24% from its low.
Rising prices stand to benefit the commodity-producing economies. That has encouraged John Baur, a
co-manager of Eaton Vance Global Macro Fund, to avoid long-term U.S. Treasurys in favor of Brazilian debt.
That country's stock market is up 12% this year.
China's refined-copper imports soared 99% in February from a year ago, perhaps indicating that "they want to
have the material available" when infrastructure projects start, says Catherine Virga, a researcher at
commodities research firm CPM Group.

Don't Blame
Greenspan
It's become conventional wisdom that Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve was responsible for the housing
crisis. Virtually every commentator who blames Mr. Greenspan points to the low interest rates during his last
few years at the Fed.
The link seems obvious. Everyone knows that the Fed can drive interest rates lower by pumping more
money into the economy, right? Well, yes. But it doesn't follow that that's why interest rates were so low in
the early 2000s. Other factors affect interest rates too. In particular, a sudden increase in savings will drive
down interest rates. And such a shift did occur. As Mr. Greenspan pointed out on this page on March 11,
there was a surge in savings from other countries. Although he names only China, some of the Middle
Eastern oil-producing countries were also responsible for much of this new saving. Shift the supply curve to
the right and, wonder of wonders, the price falls. In this case, the price of saving and lending is the interest
rate.
But how do we know that it was an increase in saving, not an increase in the money supply, that caused
interest rates to fall? Look at the money supply.
Since 2001, the annual year-to-year growth rate of MZM (money of zero maturity, which is M2 minus small
time deposits plus institutional money market shares) fell from over 20% to nearly 0% by 2006. During that
time, M2 (which is M1 plus time deposits) growth fell from over 10% to around 2%, and M1 (which is currency
plus demand deposits) growth fell from over 10% to negative rates.
The annual growth rate of the monetary base, the magnitude over which the Fed has the most control, fell
from 10% in 2001 to below 5% in 2006. Moreover, nearly all of the growth in the monetary base went into
currency, an increasing proportion of which is held abroad.
Moreover, if the Fed was the culprit, why was the housing bubble world-wide? Do Mr. Greenspan's critics
seriously contend that the Fed was responsible for high housing prices in, say, Spain?
This is not to say that the Greenspan Fed was blameless. Particularly disturbing is the way the
lender-of-last-resort function has increased moral hazard, a trend to which Mr. Greenspan contributed and
which current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has put on steroids.
But to the extent that the federal government is to blame, the main fed culprits are the beefed up Community
Reinvestment Act and the run-amok Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All played a key role in loosening lending
standards.
I'm not claiming that we should have a Federal Reserve. We simply can't depend on getting another good
chairman like Mr. Greenspan, and are more likely to get another Arthur Burns or Ben Bernanke. Serious work
by economists Lawrence H. White of the University of Missouri, St. Louis, and George Selgin of West Virginia
University makes a persuasive case that abolishing the Fed and deregulating money would improve the
macroeconomy. I'm making a more modest claim: Mr. Greenspan was not to blame for the housing bubble.

What Savings Glut?

By Gerald P. O'Driscoll Jr.
Alan Greenspan responded to his critics on these pages on March 11. He singled out an op-ed by John
Taylor a month earlier, "How Government Created the Financial Crisis" (Feb. 9), for special criticism. Mr.
Greenspan's argument defending his policy is two-fold: (1) the Fed controls overnight interest rates, but not
"long-term interest rates and the home-mortgage rates driven by them"; and (2) a global excess of savings
was "the presumptive cause of the world-wide decline in long-term rates."
Neither argument stands up to scrutiny. First, Mr. Greenspan writes as if mortgages were of the 30-year
variety, financed by 30-year money. Would that it were so! We would not be in the present mess. But the
post-2002 period was characterized by one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), teaser rates that reset in
two or three years, etc. Five-year ARMs became "long-term" money.
The Fed only determines the overnight, federal-funds rate, but movements in that rate substantially influence
the rates on such mortgages. Additionally, maturity-mismatches abounded and were the source of much of
the current financial stress. Short-dated commercial paper funded investment banks and other entities
dealing in mortgage-backed securities.
Second, Mr. Greenspan offers conjecture, not evidence, for his claim of a global savings excess. Mr. Taylor
has cited evidence from the IMF to the contrary, however. Global savings and investment as a share of world
GDP have been declining since the 1970s. The data is in Mr. Taylor's new book, "Getting Off Track."
The former Fed chairman also cautions against excessive regulation as a policy response to the crisis. On
this point I concur. He does not directly address, however, the Fed's policy response. From the beginning, the
Fed diagnosed the problem as lack of liquidity and employed every means at its disposal to supply liquidity to
credit markets. It has been to little avail and, in the process, the Fed has loaded up its balance sheet with
dubious assets.
The credit crunch continues because many banks are capital-impaired, not illiquid. Treasury's policy shifts
and inconsistencies under both administrations have sidelined potential private capital. Treasury became the
capital provider of last resort. It was late to recognize the hole in banks' balance sheets and consistently
underestimated its size. The need to provide second- and even third-round capital injections proves that.
In summary, Fed policy did help cause the bubble. Subsequent policy responses by that institution have
suffered from sins of commission and omission. As Mr. Taylor argued, the government (including the Fed)
caused, prolonged, and worsened the crisis. It continues doing so.

Low Rates Led
To ARMs
By Todd J. Zywicki
Alan Greenspan's argument that the Federal Reserve's policies on short-term interest rates had no impact
on long-term mortgage interest rates overlooks the way in which its policies changed consumer behavior.
A simple yet powerful pattern emerges from survey data of the past 25 years collected by HSH Associates
(the financial publishers): The spread between fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) and ARMs typically hovers
between 100 and 150 basis points, representing the premium that a borrower has to pay to induce the lender
to bear the risk of interest-rate fluctuations. At times, however, the spread between FRMs and ARMs breaks
out of this band and becomes either larger or smaller than average, leading marginal consumers to prefer
one to the other. Sometimes the adjustment in the market share of ARMs lags behind changes in the size of
the spread, but over time when the spread widens, the percentage of ARMs increases and vice-versa.
In 1987, before subprime lending was even a gleam in Angelo Mozilo's eye, the spread rose to 300 basis
points and the share of ARMs eventually rose to almost 70%, according to the Federal Finance Housing
Board. When the spread shrunk to near 100 basis points in the late-1990s, the percentage of ARMs fell into
the single digits. Other periods of time show similar dynamics.
In the latest cycle the spread rose from under 50 basis points at the end of 2000 to 230 basis points in
mid-2004 and the percentage of ARMs rose from 10% to 40%. The Fed's subsequent increases on
short-term rates caused short- and long-term rates to converge, squeezing the spread to about 50 points by
2007 and reducing ARMs to less than 10% of the market.

Record-low ARM interest rates kept housing generally affordable even as buyers could stretch to pay higher
prices. Low short-term interest rates, combined with tax and other policies, also drew speculative, short-term
home-flippers into certain markets. As the Fed increased short-term rates in 2005-07, interest rate resets
raised monthly payments, triggering the initial round of defaults and falling home prices. Foreclosure rates
initially soared on both prime and subprime ARMS much more than for FRMs.
Why did the ARM substitution result in a wave of foreclosures this time, unlike prior times? During previous
times with high percentages of ARMs, the dip in short-term interest rates was a leading indicator of an
eventual decline in long-term rates, reflecting the general downward trend in rates of the past 25 years. By
contrast, during this housing bubble the interest rate on ARMs were artificially low and eventually rose back to
the level of FRMs. There were other factors that exacerbated the problem -- most notably increased
risk-layering and a decline in underwriting standards -- but the Fed's artificial lowering of short-term interest
rates and the resulting substitution by consumers to ARMs triggered the bubble and subsequent crisis.

The Fed Provided
The Fuel
By David Malpass
The blame for the current crisis extends well beyond the Fed -- to banks, regulators, bond raters, mortgage
fraud, the Bush administration's weak-dollar policy and Lehman bankruptcy decisions, and Congress's
reckless housing policies through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Community Reinvestment Act.
But the Fed provided the key fuel with its 1% interest rate choice in 2003 and 2004 and "measured" (meaning
inadequate) rate hikes in 2004-2006. It ignored inflationary dollar weakness, higher interest rate choices
abroad, the Taylor Rule, and the booming performance of the U.S. and global economies.
Even by the Fed's own backward-looking inflation metrics, the core consumption deflator exceeded the
Fed's 2% limit for 18 quarters in a row beginning with the second quarter of 2004, while 12-month Consumer
Price Index (CPI) inflation hit 4.7% in September 2005 and 5.4% in July 2008. This despite the Fed's
constant assurances that inflation would moderate (unlikely given the crashing dollar.)
Despite its role as regulator and rate-setter, the Fed claimed that it could not identify asset bubbles until they
popped (see my rebuttal on this page "The Fed's Moment of Weakness," Sept. 25, 2002). It is clear that the
Fed's interest rate polices cause wide swings in the value of the dollar and huge momentum-based capital
flows. These bring predictable -- and avoidable -- deflations, inflations and asset bubbles.
Beginning in 2003, the Fed filled the liquidity punch bowl. Low rates and the weakening dollar created a
monumental carry trade (borrow dollars, buy anything). This transmitted the Fed's monetary excess abroad
and into commodities. As the punch bowl overflowed, even global bonds bubbled (prices rose, yields fell),
contributing to the global housing boom. Alan Greenspan singled out this correlation in his March 11 op-ed on
this page, "The Fed Didn't Cause the Housing Bubble."
Given this power, the Fed should itself stop the current deflation and the economic freefall. It has to add
enough liquidity to offset frozen credit markets, the collapse in the velocity of money, and bank deleveraging
(which has reversed the normal money multiplier.)
The Fed was on the right track in late November when it committed to purchasing $600 billion in longer-term,
government-guaranteed securities. Equities rose globally, and some credit markets thawed, including a
decline in mortgage rates and corporate bond spreads. However, the Fed reversed course in January,
delaying its asset purchases and shrinking its balance sheet. Growth in the money supply stopped. Since
then, the Fed increased the amount of assets it intends to purchase, but lengthened the time period rather
than accelerating the pace of purchases.
Given the magnitude of the crisis and the stakes, the Fed should be buying safe assets fast, not parceling out
a few billions. Confidence and money velocity would also increase if the Fed committed itself to dollar
stability, not instability, to avoid causing future inflations and deflations.

Loose Money and the

Derivative Bubble
By Judy Shelton
The Fed owns this crisis. The buck stops there -- but it didn't.
Too many dollars were churned out, year after year, for the economy to absorb; more credit was created than
could be fruitfully utilized. Some of it went into subprime mortgages, yes, but the monetary excess that fueled
the most threatening "systemic risk" bubble went into highly speculative financial derivatives that rode atop
packaged, mortgage-backed securities until they dropped from exhaustion.
The whole point of having a central bank is to calibrate the money supply to the genuine needs of an
economy -- to purchase goods and services, to fund productive investment -- with the aim of achieving
maximum sustainable long-term growth. Since price stability is a key factor toward that end, central bankers
attempt to finesse the amount of money and credit in the system; if interest rates are kept too low too long, it
causes an unwarranted expansion of credit. As the money supply increases relative to real economic
production, the spillage of excess purchasing power results in higher prices for goods and services.
But not always. Sometimes the monetary excess finds its way into a narrow sector of the economy -- such as
real estate, or equities, or rare art. This time it was the financial derivatives market.
In the last six years, according to the Bank for International Settlements, the derivatives market exploded as a
global haven for speculative investment, its aggregate notional value rising more than fivefold to $684 trillion
in 2008 from $127 trillion in 2002. Financial obligations amounting to 12 times the value of the entire world's
gross domestic product were written and traded and retraded among financial institutions -- playing off every
instance of market turbulence, every gyration in exchange rates, every nuanced statement uttered by a
central banker in Washington or Frankfurt -- like so many tulip contracts.
The sheer enormity of this speculative bubble, let alone the speed at which it inflated, testifies to inordinately
loose monetary policy from the Fed, keeper of the world's predominant currency. The fact that Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac provided the "underlying security" for many of the derivative contracts merely compounds
the error of government intervention in the private sector. Politicians altered normal credit risk parameters,
while the Fed distorted housing prices through perpetual inflation.
At this point, dickering over whether Alan Greenspan should have formulated monetary policy in strict
accordance with an econometrically determined "rule," or whether the Fed even has the power to influence
long-term rates, raises a more fundamental question: Why do we need a central bank?
"There are numbers of us, myself included, who strongly believe that we did very well in the 1870 to 1914
period with an international gold standard." That was Mr. Greenspan, speaking 17 months ago on the Fox
Business Network.
In the rules-versus-discretion debate over how best to achieve sound money, that is the ultimate answer.

To Change
Policy, Change
The Law
By Vincent Reinhart
Anyone seeking an application of the principle that fame is fleeting need look no further than the assessment
of Federal Reserve policy from 2002 to 2005.
At the beginning, capital spending was anemic, and considerable wealth had been destroyed by the equity
crash. The recovery from the 1990-91 recession was "jobless," and the current one was following the same
script. Moreover, inflation was so distinctly pointed down that deflation seemed a palpable threat.
Keeping the federal-funds rate low for a long time was viewed as appropriately balancing the risks to the
Fed's dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Indeed, the Fed was seen as extending
the stable economic performance since 1983 that had been dubbed the "Great Moderation."
Over the period 2002-2005, the federal-funds rate ran below the recommendation of the policy rule made
famous by Stanford Professor John Taylor. No doubt, the Taylor Rule provides important guidance on how

--- Page 161 ---
Page 161 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
that rate should change in response to changes in the two mandated goals of policy. First, it should move up
or down by more than any change in inflation. Second, the Fed should respond to changes in resource
slack. That is, caring about unemployment is not a sign of weakness in a central banker but rather that of
strength in better achieving good results.
The Taylor Rule is less helpful to practitioners of policy in anchoring the level of the federal-funds rate. The
rule is fit to experience based on a notion of the rate that should prevail if inflation were at its goal and
resources fully employed, which is known as the equilibrium funds rate. That is an important technicality.
Using a faulty estimate of the equilibrium funds rate is like flying a plane that is otherwise perfect except for
an unreliable altimeter. The exception looms large when flying over a mountainous region.
From 2002 to 2005, the economic landscape appeared especially changeable, with the contours shaped by
lower wealth, lingering job losses, and looming disinflation. To Fed officials at the time, this indicated that the
equilibrium funds rate was unusually low. Simply, the only way to provide lift to an economy in which resource
use was slack and inflation pointed down was to keep policy accommodative relative to longer-term
standards.
That was then. Now, policy during the period is seen as fueling a housing bubble.
The Fed is guilty as charged in setting policy to achieve the goals mandated in the law. Fed policy makers
cannot be held responsible for the fuel to speculative fires provided by foreign saving and the thin
compensation for risk that satisfied global investors. Nor can the chain of subsequent mistakes that drove a
downturn into a debacle be laid at the feet of the Federal Open Market Committee of 2002 to 2005. If the
results seem less than desirable in retrospect, change the law those policy makers were following, but do not
blame them for following prevailing law.

World News: Zambia's Economy Falls With Price of Copper

LUANSHYA, Zambia -- Here in the heart of Africa's copper belt, last year's high commodities prices meant
regular chicken dinners for the family of Hurryton Mwanza.
But the 39-year-old miner lost his job when the town's foreign-owned copper mine shut down in January. Mr.
Mwanza pulled his eight-year-old daughter out of private school, and is expecting an eviction notice from the
landlord of his two-room apartment. He gets by selling cooking oil from a wooden market stall. These days,
dinners for the family are only nshima, a cheap staple made of corn flour.
"We've got no other solution," he says. "No other source of income."
Over the past decade, as a commodities boom boosted growth across poverty-stricken sub-Saharan Africa,
governments, donors and aid groups watched and hoped it meant the start of a more prosperous era. But
now the commodities downturn is walloping big swaths of the continent, ending an unprecedented period of
optimism in resource-rich countries across Africa.
In the good times, Zambia's Copperbelt province flourished. Rural towns blossomed and prospered,
sustained by foreign-owned mining companies and the handsome salaries they provided.
The Zambian government didn't take advantage of the boom to diversify its economy or save for a rainy day.
It lost out on a large share of copper revenue by offering lucrative concessions to mining companies. When
the mines began to pull out, Zambia's foreign-exchange flows dwindled, depreciating its currency, the
kwacha. The International Monetary Fund is considering a $200 million loan to boost the country's
foreign-exchange reserves, on top of a $79 million loan approved in June.
"The copper industry is dominant," says David Punabantu, a Lusaka-based economist. "So when the price of
copper went down, the economy was literally dead."
Zambia is working to find new investors to take over the closed Luanshya mine. Maxwell Mwale, minister of
mines and minerals development, says that several companies are interested and that he hopes to have the
mine back in business by May.
The government also said it will boost its stake in mines across the country's copper-producing region so it
will have more control over Zambia's economic mainstay in future crises.
"Mining cannot be left to commodities traders," Mr. Mwale says. "It's not for speculators, but for those who
understand the mining business. That's the lesson the government has learned."
The carnage isn't uniform across sub-Saharan Africa. The price of gold, a plentiful commodity in many of
Africa's mining-dependent economies, has soared as global investors rush to safety. And some of the
continent's economies -- even those most exposed to commodities -- are better off than they were in the
aftermath of an earlier boom in the 1980s because of measures they took during the good years.
In Botswana, DeBeers Group SA has suspended operations at a handful of diamond mines. But the country
has socked away considerable foreign-exchange reserves, cushioning the blow. The boom lured energy
companies to Ghana, in the past seen as too risky for oil exploration. Production will begin there next year,
opening a big new revenue stream, even at today's lower prices. Other sub-Saharan governments -- including
Liberia, once seen as a desperate case -- have tried to diversify their economies away from a
single-commodity play.
Zambia didn't. The country relies on copper sales for an estimated 70% of government revenue. Only last
April, as copper prices were nearing their peak, did officials restructure antiquated tax laws to take better
advantage of the boom.

Copper prices have fallen to just under $4,000 a ton from their peak of just under $9,000 a ton last summer.
With demand in the industrialized world falling not just for copper, but also for other minerals and metals
plentiful in Africa, mining companies across the continent have shut down operations.
Canada-based Anvil Mining Ltd. suspended operations at its big copper mine, Dikulushi, in the Democratic
Republic of Congo in December. Two months later, platinum producer Lonmin PLC suspended operations at
its mine in Limpopo, in northern South Africa.
In the copper town of Luanshya, the mine, a Swiss-Israeli joint venture, fired all of its 1,740 workers in
January. While that's just a small slice of the town's population of 120,000, mining money trickled down and
fed most facets of the economy.
Farmers sold produce to feed miners' families. Bars and restaurants popped up. Brick makers couldn't bake
bricks fast enough to keep up with the construction boom. Minibuses motored shoppers around town.
Miners in Luanshya -- some of whom had been making more than civil servants -- bought land and started
building larger homes for their families. They took out loans to start up side businesses and sent their children
to private schools. They bought televisions and DVD players, and sent money across Zambia to family
members in rural areas, who depended on the monthly assistance.
"People were in a jovial mood," says Chishimba Kambwili, a provincial representative in the national
parliament. "They had money. They could do anything."
That ground to a halt on Jan. 21, when Luanshya Copper Mines PLC announced the closure. Workers
arriving at the mine's red-iron gates were told to go home.
Today, the town center is quiet. Rows of empty minibuses and taxis wait for passengers. Restaurants have
few customers. Some neighborhoods are dotted with half-built brick homes, already being reclaimed by the
brush. Market stalls selling kapenta, or tiny dried fish, tomatoes and beans are largely empty of shoppers.
Just a few months ago, Spencer Ngolotiya, 44, was training to become a mine captain, a job that would have
put him in charge of some 300 workers. He bought the three-bedroom home he lives in now, along with a
minibus, hoping to start a side business. His salary was enough to send his children to private school and
take the family on vacations to a nearby game park, where they watched impala prance through the bush.
Now laid off, he's driving his minibus to earn a living. But few people can afford to ride. Mr. Ngolotiya spends
his time in the quiet town square, sitting in the driver's seat. He's lucky if he can get enough passengers to
make a single trip each day, he says.
"I used to knock off around six and go to church with my family," he says. "Now I spend up to 20 hours here,
just trying to see if I can make a second trip."

Crude-oil futures ended lower as U.S. inventories soared to 16-year highs, but they found support from a drop
in stockpiles at an important oil hub.
Further losses also were stemmed by the weak dollar, as investors fretting about inflation eye commodities
as a safer haven amid an unstable economy.
Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled down $1.21, or 2.2%, at $52.77 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
Crude has now closed above $50 a barrel for five sessions in a row, rising with stock markets and a trickle of
better-than-expected economic news in the U.S. But the inventory overhang and poor demand continue to
undermine efforts to establish a price floor, and crude sold off more Wednesday as stocks turned from black
to red in intraday trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up closing nearly 90 points higher.
"The market's more upbeat but we could easily fall back, especially if this little burst of optimism seems to be
built on false hopes," said Tom Bentz, an analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. "We
need a test of $50 to see if this could be a solid support."
The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. crude-oil inventories jumped 3.3 million barrels, to
356.6 million barrels, in the week ended March 20, more than double analysts' forecasts, to send stockpiles to
the highest level since July 1993.
However, crude inventories at Nymex delivery point Cushing, Okla., were down 2.2 million barrels, while
gasoline and distillate levels also fell much more than expected.
There were some glimmers of hope on the macroeconomic front, including a surprise jump in durable-good
orders, which rose in February, but the long-term outlook isn't as rosy.
The weak dollar has helped to limit crude's losses as investors seek a hedge against concerns about
inflation roused by the Federal Reserve's stimulus efforts.
The greenback also came under pressure Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he
was open to considering a new global reserve currency, though he soon clarified his comments, adding that
the dollar will likely remain the world's dominant reserve currency "for a long period of time."
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices rose on bargain hunting following the previous session's slump. Thinly traded nearby March
gold rose $12.10, or 1.3%, to $935.40 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. The most-active June
contract rose $12 to $938.
WHEAT: Prices fell hard on forecasts for precipitation in the dry U.S. hard red winter wheat belt of the central
and southern Plains as the crop breaks dormancy. Kansas City Board of Trade May wheat tumbled 33 cents
to $5.55 a bushel.

Gold Falls to $923.30 As Risk Trade Returns

Gold futures fell as many stock markets world-wide advanced, with some booking profits in the precious
metal.
Thinly traded nearby March gold lost $28.80, or 3%, to settle at $923.30 a troy ounce on the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active June contract also fell $28.80, to $926. Gold fell for
the third day in a row and six of the last seven.
"It's safe-haven liquidation," said Ira Epstein, director of the Ira Epstein division of Linn Group.
Much of the decline occurred in after-hours trading Monday as stocks rallied, said Leonard Kaplan, president
of Prospector Asset Management, as gold's trading session ends before stock markets close in the U.S.
"With the dollar stronger, oil lower and bonds lower, all of those are influencing gold to go lower," Mr. Kaplan
said.
The Dow industrials gained 497.48 points Monday. Overseas stock exchanges then rose during the night.
Stock selloffs in recent weeks have tended to result in haven buying of gold, while stock-market rallies often
have led to gold liquidation and reduced buying as risk appetite returned for other assets.
"It seemed like it attracted some follow-through selling" on Tuesday, Stephen Platt, analyst with Archer
Financial Services, said of gold.
George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures, said, "Gold remained under pressure
due to combined selling from funds looking for other opportunities also pressuring other metals in the
complex."
Meanwhile, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the world's No. 3 producer of the metal, said it had restarted operations
at its mine in Guinea after it was ordered closed by the country's ruler last Friday.
Also Tuesday, commodities research and consulting firm CPM Group released this year's CPM Gold
Yearbook. The group said that economic uncertainties related to recessionary conditions and joblessness,
volatile and vulnerable financial markets, and weakening economic conditions could send gold to records
above $1,000 this year.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures inched up, abandoning early losses ahead of Wednesday's weekly report on U.S.
petroleum inventories. Light, sweet crude oil for May delivery settled 18 cents higher, or 0.3%, at $53.98 a
barrel on the Nymex, a high for 2009. Some analysts said oil markets mightn't be pricing in the extent of
dwindling output from Russia, the world's biggest producer. Last week, the Russian government predicted
that oil production would drop 1.1% this year to 9.68 million barrels a day. A Dow Jones Newswires survey of
analysts puts the decline at more than twice that rate.
NATURAL GAS: Futures rose slightly in choppy trading as cold weather blanketed U.S. gas-consuming
regions and as traders repurchased contracts to square books ahead of Friday's contract expiration. Nymex
natural gas for April delivery settled 5.3 cents higher, or 1.2%, at $4.347 a million British thermal units.

Geithner's Gamble Needs Speculators
As last throws of the dice go, this is midnight at the craps table for Timothy Geithner.
On Monday the Treasury secretary laid out plans aimed at cleaning up bank balance sheets and resurrecting
the securitization market, which once helped credit flow through the economy.
The Treasury wants to persuade private investors to buy loans and asset-backed securities. It aims to do that
by using dwindling Troubled Asset Relief Program dollars to invest in such assets alongside private investors.
The government will also provide and guarantee cheap loans so returns on these assets can be magnified
with leverage.
This all will be done through public-private investment funds and through the expansion of the Federal
Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.
The Treasury envisions $100 billion of equity being levered up to buy $500 billion of assets, and maybe as
much as $1 trillion over time. The financing will come from government-guaranteed debt issued by the funds
and from the Fed.
The first risk: Treasury may be trying to revive segments of the securitization market that only existed
because of years of easy money, not because their practices and economics were sound.
As a result, when the government stops lending, the prices of leveraged assets could plunge. Knowing this, it
might be hard to generate sustained buying.
Take securities and loans backed by commercial real estate. These have plunged in price, as investors fear
issuers will find it hard to refinance this debt when it comes due.
And the numbers aren't small: Some $814 billion of these bonds and loans are set to mature from 2009 to
2011, according to Foresight Analytics.
If this market is merely experiencing a shortfall in confidence and liquidity, the Treasury's latest moves may
work.
But if the underlying properties are worth much less today, the government is engaged in a game of price
support it can't ultimately win.
This also applies to Treasury's aim for banks to use the schemes to sell off tainted assets. Investors, even
with leverage provided by the government, will likely bid for assets well below what banks are willing to sell at.
After all, investors need to build in a big margin of error given that the range of estimated losses on bank
assets is enormous. CreditSights projects collective losses of the four biggest U.S. banks through the end of
next year could be anywhere from $250 billion to $450 billion.
Granted, the Treasury can fill any holes on bank balance sheets resulting from losses on asset sales with
equity injections from the TARP. But it isn't clear there are enough TARP funds to do that on a big scale.
Mr. Geithner really has gone all in.

Suncor's Solution to the Riddle of the Sands

--- Page 169 ---
Page 169 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Suncor Energy's $15 billion merger with Petro-Canada recalls the megadeals of a decade ago. Similar to
then, this is a defensive, all-stock deal following a collapse in oil prices.
The added twist is oil sands, which comprise virtually all of Suncor's reserves and 64% of Petro-Canada's.
More important, though, most of the latter's current output comes from conventional oil fields.
In essence, Suncor, a pioneer of the oil-sands industry, is conceding that being a pure play on this high-cost
resource is unsustainable in a world of volatile oil prices. Extracting oil from sands requires vast upfront
investment.
On the other hand, oil from sands is mined, not forced out by underground pressure, as in regular fields. So
once the upfront investment is made, oil sands don't require the maintenance capital expenditure needed by
mature conventional fields. The merged company can now toggle capex more easily between conventional
and sands projects, depending on economic conditions.
Despite offering a 33% premium to Friday's closing price, Suncor's terms equate to less than nine times 2010
earnings for PetroCanada -- using stock valued at more than 12 times.
What is more, government restrictions on ownership of Petro-Canada will transfer to the new merged entity.
Last year, 40% of energy deals globally involved unconventional resources, according to IHS Herold. Foreign
majors such as France's Total are attracted by the Canadian oil sands' large resources and relatively low
political risk. With Suncor having seen its market capitalization drop from almost $68 billion last year to just
$16 billion recently, linking up with Petro-Canada looks defensive in more ways than one.

Hungry for a Leader in Budapest
Help wanted: prime minister, one-year contract, medium-size and middle-income Eastern European country,
economy on International Monetary Fund life support. Top priority: big cuts in public spending to keep budget
deficit to 3% of gross domestic product this year ahead of an election due in spring 2010.
Whoever succeeds Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, who tendered his resignation this weekend,
has an unenviable task. The country now faces a far more severe correction than the one envisaged in the
current budget, which was premised on a 3% contraction, and by the IMF and European Union when they
agreed on a $25 billion credit line for Hungary late in 2008. Budapest may have to find $1.4 billion to $2.3
billion in budget cuts to hold the deficit to the level the IMF believes is necessary.
The political challenge of instituting big cutbacks in social spending as unemployment rises is huge.
Still, it isn't all gloom. Billion of dollars of IMF and EU aid have helped stabilize the forint and the local banking
system. Hungary might muddle through for a few months. Should Hungary need more international support, it
is likely to be available. But any further aid will depend partly on Hungary's commitment to reform. A fresh
election and a new government would be preferable to a lame-duck prime minister.

Aabar Hopes
For Traction
With Daimler
What really lies behind Abu Dhabi's 1.95 billion euro ($2.65 billion) investment in Daimler? Aabar
Investments, which is majority owned by the Gulf emirate, insists the deal is purely financial. But Abu Dhabi's
motives may also be strategic.
Aabar is acquiring a 9.1% stake at a price equal to a 5% discount for Daimler based on Friday's closing share
price. And with the shares down 60% in two years, Aabar may feel it is getting a bargain. But Abu Dhabi
hasn't done well with past acquisitions of big stakes in Western companies. Its investments in Citigroup and
Barclays, for example, are deep underwater. Even with a seat on Daimler's board, Aabar will struggle to
exercise influence over the management of one of Germany's most prestigious brands.
The deal looks more promising from a strategic perspective. After all, Abu Dhabi's rulers can hardly be happy
to see an industry whose growth guarantees high oil prices suffering a slow and agonizing decline. The
Middle East's third-largest oil producer has been building a strategic presence in the auto industry for some
time. It is in Abu Dhabi's interest to support auto makers like Daimler to ensure there is no shortage of cash to
fund new models.

Indeed, the Kuwait Investment Authority is also an investor in Daimler, a company that was previously part of
Dubai International Capital's portfolio. Other automotive companies that benefit from Arab money include
Aston Martin, Ferrari and Fiat. And with U.S. auto makers begging President Obama's federal government for
bailouts, it may only be a matter of time before Arab money comes to Detroit's rescue, too.

Something has jolted the U.S. independent power sector to life. In the past five trading sessions, battered
stocks such as Mirant and Reliant Energy have jumped by 15% and 19%, respectively. Dynegy is up 32%.
Investors' renewed taste for risk, alongside a jump in natural-gas prices, which often set power prices, have
no doubt played a part.
The other possibility is the potential for M&A. Exelon is currently in the thick of a hostile bid for indie NRG
Energy. Other big electricity companies such as Entergy or Duke Energy could be tempted to pick up
independents at distressed prices. With the economy in the doldrums, a deal or two is probably mandatory to
spark a sustainable rally.

Impact of New Bank-Rescue Plan
On the Dollar Is Up for Debate
---
U.S. Currency's Recent Response to Factors Is Atypical
The currency markets have been a weird place of late. For the past few months, the dollar maintained its
strength even in anticipation of more government debt and Federal Reserve policies that would seem to
encourage dollar weakness. Now, with the most recent announcement of the newest plan to nuke the
festering assets on the balance sheets of U.S. banks, the dollar is stronger, rallying even when the equity
market is rising.
There are numerous expectations about what could transpire for the dollar in coming months. Some believe
the greenback will, or should, weaken because of the anticipation of a bloated federal budget and
current-account deficit that concerns foreign investors about the U.S. system's stability.
Others suggest that if markets do recover, it would undermine the case for the dollar, as investors would be
more persuaded to buy riskier assets denominated in other currencies.
"It's really a struggle today, and a tug of war between improvement in risk appetite, which should be driving
the dollar lower . . . and the assurance for foreign investors that there is basically a floor the U.S. government
wants to create for these toxic assets," says Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT. "The risks for
the banks are diminishing by the day, and that's why banking stocks are rallying."
Others arrive at a divergent view of the plan's impact on the dollar. Chris Gaffney, vice president at EverBank
World Markets Group, believes the dollar rally on Monday is the result of traders reversing last week's moves,
when the dollar sold off sharply.
While he believes the plan increases the risk to the U.S. currency, he notes that traditional safe-haven assets
such as U.S. Treasurys and gold haven't rallied along with the dollar.
The lack of a positive move in those assets could also be a profit-covering move, but this interpretation has its
own complications, because it undermines the case for safe-haven positioning by investors.
It may be that investors are reacting positively to a plan that increases investors' appetite for risk but also are
heartened by the swiftness of the U.S. government's moves, when compared with others.
"It's fair to say there is an element of this that [the market] was oversold," says Chris Furness, head of
currency strategy at 4Cast Ltd. "Everyone and his brother were short at the time. There's also a slight feeling
in the background that maybe the U.S. administration is getting to grips with things, or rather more quickly
than most of the rest of the world."

Crude Hitches a Ride On Stocks' Coattails

Crude Hitches a Ride On Stocks' Coattails

NEW YORK -- Crude oil closed at a fresh 2009 high Monday, taking a cue from surging stock markets.
Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled at $53.80 a barrel, up 3.3% or $1.73 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract became the new front-month U.S. benchmark after April futures expired last week.
Nymex crude last closed higher on Nov. 28, 2008, before floating through nearly four months of aimless,
volatile trading as shrinking world demand and ample amounts of oil in storage capped price gains. Crude
has now closed above $50 a barrel for three days running, buoyed by a combination of recent supply
cutbacks from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, a flight to hard assets on renewed fears of
inflation and stronger stock markets.
"We are in a new trading range," said Mark Waggoner, president at Excel Futures in Newport Beach, Calif.
Monday's upswing came as stock markets bounced on the Treasury Department's new plan to use as much
as $100 billion in funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and capital from private investors
to buy troubled assets bogging down the balance sheets of banks. Encouraging housing data also fueled
equities.
"There doesn't seem to be a lot of fundamental news in the oil markets," said Tom Knight, vice president of
trading and supply at oil wholesaler Truman Arnold Cos. in Texarkana, Texas. "It's really more trading in
sympathy with other financial markets."
Oil and stock markets don't show a strong correlation over long periods, but on some days move in tandem.
Oil traders sometimes watch the stock market for indications of a turnaround in the economy that could
buttress demand.
Developments in oil demand and supply were mixed. China's General Administration of Customs confirmed
that crude-oil imports in February averaged about 3.07 million barrels a day, down 18% from a year earlier.
In Nigeria, a major crude exporter, oil workers threatened to begin a three-day warning strike Tuesday if talks
with the federal government should deadlock. Union workers are opposed to government plans to deregulate
the downstream sector of the oil industry, end subsidies on petroleum products and privatize the country's
state-owned refineries.
In Brazil, workers began striking at the small Manaus oil refinery in Amazonas State. A union official told Dow
Jones Newswires that the strike closed the facility, but state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras,
later said all its units are operating normally.
In other commodity markets:
SOYBEANS: Futures rallied, but settled off their highs, supported by strength in stocks and some concerns of
a new strike by Argentine farmers. A weaker dollar also lent support. Chicago Board of Trade May soybeans
rose 3.5 cents to $9.5550 a bushel.
GOLD: Prices fell slightly on profit-taking as risk aversion waned following the Treasury Department's
unveiling of a plan designed to get private investors to take some of the toxic debt off bank balance sheets.
Thinly traded nearby March gold lost $3.70, or 0.4%, to $952.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the
Nymex. The most-active April contract also slipped $3.70, to $952.50.

Consumers to Plug Treasury Hole?
In trying to span budget deficits, the U.S. government has a new ally: suddenly frugal U.S. households. But
consumers mightn't be as effective at bankrolling Uncle Sam as they were at buying Escalades and
McMansions.
Americans will certainly boost their savings rate, from less than zero in the frothiest days of the housing boom
to as much as 10% of disposable income by the end of 2010, according to some estimates. That would
amount to roughly $1 trillion a year in excess cash, estimates Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Andrew
Tilton.
That money has to be parked somewhere. The options for postbubble investors are unappetizing. Stocks and
real estate may be non grata for some time. Short-term interest rates near zero make cash even duller than
usual. Gold, firearms and canned goods have their fans, but many investors will probably turn to Treasury
bonds.
There may be significant pent-up demand. According to Federal Reserve data, Treasury holdings of U.S.
households and nonprofit organizations fell from $914.25 billion, or 2.6% of total household assets, in the first
quarter of 1997, to $273.2 billion, or just 0.4% of assets, in the fourth quarter of 2008.
As a share of household assets, Treasury securities mightn't return to their peaks of more than 5%, set in the
1950s. But they might well get back to at least the 2% level of the early 1990s, before investors were beguiled
by the prospect of faster money in stocks and housing.
Returning to that share could translate into $1.2 trillion in extra Treasury demand through 2011, if household
assets increase at their historical trend rate.
That still would leave another $2 trillion of new savings available for other assets such as stocks, municipal
bonds and real estate.
The extra Treasury demand would dwarf the $727 billion in Treasurys held by China at the end of 2008. And
it would help to plug the gap if the Chinese were to scale back their Treasury purchases, because they earn
less foreign reserves, direct more of their funds into domestic investment or decide that they need to diversify
further away from expensive Treasurys.
But even $1.2 trillion of new U.S. consumer demand for Treasurys still wouldn't fill the hole created by
burgeoning fiscal deficits. The Congressional Budget Office Friday projected fiscal deficits of $4.2 trillion
through 2011.
And the durability of household demand for Treasurys is no sure thing, given the limited returns on offer. The
yield on 10-year Treasurys is only 2.63%.
In buying Treasurys when prices are near generational highs, artificially boosted by the promise of $300
billion in fresh demand from the Federal Reserve, households would once again risk buying high and selling
low, as they did when they traded attractively priced Treasurys for stocks and houses in the past decade.

Creditors Risk Getting Submerged if They Can't Take a DIP
Fancy a DIP? A number of pension funds do. Their interest in putting up debtor-in-possession financing for
bankrupt companies is just one symptom of the hangover after the leveraged-finance party.
DIP financing is like an emergency blood transfusion. The 17 pension funds that signed onto chemicals firm

--- Page 175 ---
Page 175 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
LyondellBasell Industries' $3.25 billion plan or the four backing DIP money for plastics manufacturer Pliant
Corp. stave off liquidation in those companies.
But there still are losers. After all, the company's value declines while it still owes what it owes. Someone has
to take the hit. Tight liquidity and the speed of the economic slide has left the few DIP-finance providers still in
the game holding a strong hand. Existing creditors without the bucks to participate in the new DIP facility,
thereby being unable to roll their debt into a more senior position, can lose out.
Steve Miller, managing director at Standard &Poor's Leveraged Commentary &Data, points to the valuation
gap between existing debt rolled into Lyondell's DIP facility, 40 cents on the dollar, and unrolled debt's 16
cents. Both indicate distress, but DIP financiers enjoy a better chance of recovery given their seniority.
Funds that bought into distressed debt prebankruptcy and then participated in a DIP facility are best
positioned to reap gains. Second-lien and mezzanine holders, with junior positions in highly leveraged
buyouts, are likely to fare worst.
Their pain could be exacerbated by other boom-time innovations. Covenant-lite loans and payment-in-kind
toggles essentially provide breathing room for equity holders. But they risk delaying bankruptcy, while the
company's recovery value declines further.
Another "equity friendly" feature was incremental, or "accordion," loans, essentially preagreed slugs of extra
credit. The idea was to have dry powder available if a borrower wanted to, say, move quickly on an
acquisition.
As it turns out, that extra flexibility also is mighty handy in a downturn. Mr. Miller points to Freescale
Semiconductor Inc.'s recent use of $897 million of incremental senior loans to buy back $3 billion of bonds at
a discount. That is a win for Freescale's equity holders. However, the company's pool of first-lien loans
expanded 22%, implying lower recovery rates for holders if a default happens anyway.
According to S&P, there are 103 loan issuers rated triple-C or above with aggregate "accordion" capacity of
$37 billion. Given that covenant ratios tend to reference trailing cash flows, there is an incentive for borrowers
to use that flexibility to buy back debt sooner rather than later. Creditors who suffer lower recoveries as a
result can only kick themselves for providing those levers in the first place.

Rewind Time
For Netflix
Stock Price
The Netflix stock-price bubble may be close to bursting.
The DVD mail-order business's stock has doubled since November, taking it to a rich valuation of 26 times
estimated 2009 earnings -- a loftier multiple than either Google or Apple.
The impetus for the stock surge was Netflix's recession-era appeal, demonstrated by its strong subscriber
growth. But the rally was juiced by investor enthusiasm for Netflix's instant-watch streaming service, which
lets DVD subscribers stream movies or TV shows for no extra charge. Then came reports on March 3 that
rival Blockbuster could be facing bankruptcy, pushing the stock even higher.
Investors may be getting ahead of themselves. First, Blockbuster appears to have averted catastrophe,
disclosing Thursday it had struck a deal with some of its biggest lenders to extend a smaller version of its
revolving credit line through to September 2010.
More important, Hollywood studios appear to be waking up to the threat posed by Netflix's instant-watch
service, which the company says is being used by millions of its subscribers. That almost guarantees that
studios will look to renegotiate Netflix's content-supply deals on tougher terms.
At the same time, some of the studios are pondering their own online movie- or TV-subscription services.
Walt Disney has already flagged it is contemplating such a step.
Competition is intensifying. Amazon.com's movie-database site, IMDb, is expanding a free ad-supported
streaming service for TV shows and movies. IMDb had 19.8 million unique U.S. visitors in February
compared with 14.4 million for Netflix, according to comScore.
Netflix fans take note: A correction is looming.

Has the TARP hung an iron curtain over Wall Street?
Gallows humor descended on capitalist bastions after the House passed a 90% tax on bonuses paid by
recipients of more than $5 billion of TARP funds. Moments after the bill passed, the Soviet anthem could be
heard drifting across Goldman Sachs's trading floor on the 29th level at 85 Broad St.
No word if "We're in the Money" was tune of choice last fall when the government's guarantee of new debt

The Fed isn't alone playing catch-up with deflation.
A year ago, a company needed to be valued at $5 billion for inclusion in the S&P 500-stock index. With the
market slumping, Standard and Poor's has lowered the floor twice. Even so, 136 companies, or 27% of the
index constituents, now are valued at less than the current $3 billion threshold. Maybe S&P should stop trying
to call the bottom.

GENEVA -- Edgar de Picciotto, founder of Union Bancaire Privee, built the exclusive Swiss bank into the
world's largest investor in hedge funds by making good calls, such as backing the likes of George Soros in
the early 1970s. Now, the 80-year-old financier faces among the toughest calls of his professional life: how to
rebuild the reputation of a bank that lost hundreds of millions of dollars of client money with Bernard Madoff.
UBP has found itself under scrutiny for its role as one of a number of large European and American
institutions that fed client money into Mr. Madoff's Ponzi scheme, a role it played despite warnings from its
own research department. Thanks to that and other investment losses, the bank saw its total assets fall 26%
to $89.5 billion in 2008.
The bank's troubles are a blow for Mr. de Picciotto, the bank's chairman and main shareholder. In response,
he is taking a more active role, scrambling to cut back on risk and mollify clients. He has slashed the bank's
holdings in stocks and hedge funds, putting clients' money into cash, gold and bonds, and moved to
strengthen the bank's risk-management process.
Earlier this month, UBP offered to compensate its clients for 50% of the money they initially invested with Mr.
Madoff if they agree to stay with the bank for the next five years and promise not to sue.
"We recognize the difficult situation our clients faced" as a result of the Madoff losses, said Christophe
Bernard, UBP's chief investment officer in an interview.
Mr. Madoff earlier this month confessed to committing one of the largest frauds in history. A UBP
spokesperson said Mr. de Picciotto wasn't available for comment. UBP has said "at no moment whatsoever
did anyone at UBP believe that Mr. Madoff could possibly be perpetrating a fraud."
UBP faces an uphill battle, one that reflects a broader struggle underway in the world of Swiss private
banking, which has seen its reputation for discretion and conservatism tarnished by the Madoff scandal and a
U.S. investigation into tax fraud. Swiss banking giant UBS AG has already offered up the names of some
clients as part of a settlement with the US, and faces pressure to disclose thousands more. Meanwhile,
Switzerland is under intense international pressure to relax the bank-secrecy laws that have long been one of
its key attractions.
Mr. de Picciotto, of Syrian-Lebanese descent, moved to Switzerland in the 1950s and worked as a banker
before founding UBP's predecessor in 1969. From the bank's discreet headquarters on one of Geneva's main
luxury-shopping drags, he built a customer base of rich individuals and institutions throughout Europe, the
U.S. and the Middle East. Thanks in part to a number of lucrative bets, UBP's assets boomed, to about $120
billion at the end of 2007.
Amid the market turmoil of 2008, though, UBP lost its footing. The value of the bank's hedge-fund
investments nearly halved, to $31 billion, due to investment losses, client withdrawals, the bank's own
reallocation of assets and other factors. Among clients that have withdrawn assets is the Qatar Investment
Authority, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bernard and a QIA spokesman declined to comment.
In December, UBP said it had $700 million of exposure to Mr. Madoff through its funds of funds and the client
portfolios for which it makes investment decisions.
The dismal performance forced Mr. de Picciotto into action. Late last year, in a big move for a bank that has
long touted its expertise in selecting hedge-fund managers, he cut the bank's exposure to hedge funds in
half, to 15%, and slashed stock investments to zero. He moved to pull money from hedge-fund managers
who, like Mr. Madoff, don't use independent administrators, which perform duties such as calculating the
value of the fund's assets. He also created the new role of chief risk officer within UBP's hedge-fund
business.

Panning for Gold Among Miners
Now that the Federal Reserve has pulled the tarpaulin off its shiny new printing press, gold has jumped
again.
Not all investors stash coins or buy shares in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. Others, such as
hedge-fund manager John Paulson, just take a stake in a miner, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. in his case. Which is
better?
In the past five years, it made more sense to buy the type of gold that hurts if it falls on your head: Spot metal
more than doubled in price while global gold-mining stocks rose just over one-third. That is odd. Consider, for
example, a company producing gold at a cost of $400 an ounce. The price doubles from $500 to $1,000.
Even if costs rise 50%, unit profit should quadruple, and the share price should soar.
In part, gold-mining stocks suffered as investors broadened their appetite for all commodities. ETFs have
also cannibalized investors' cash, although the impact may be overstated. The collective value of the largest
gold ETFs is about $47 billion, according to the World Gold Council. That is equivalent to 30% of the market
capitalization of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Actual inflows over time to ETFs, however, would have
been at lower prices than today.
Mining stocks also face structural problems. Intrinsically, they carry exploration and political risk. Legacy
hedging programs damp realized prices for their output.
Meanwhile, gold's popularity stems mainly from fears of inflation and financial meltdown. The former should,
eventually, erode miners' margins. Malfunctioning credit markets hamper project financing. That tarnishes
one advantage miners have over gold: They can expand through exploration, while the metal itself pays no
dividends and doesn't breed.
Similar to the Fed, the sector also likes to print paper. Stock issuance by gold miners jumped in 2006 and
2007 alongside the gold price, raising three times the amount of the prior two years, according to data
provider Dealogic. This year, the sector has tapped investors for $5 billion already, almost as much as all of
2008.
Victor Flores, analyst at HSBC, suspects that has fueled industry cost inflation. He estimates the industry's
fully loaded 2008 cost, including such items as exploration expense, was $849 an ounce, barely below the
average gold price of $871.
HSBC pegs this year's cost at $749, suggesting good profit growth and stock performance in the near term,
especially as the sector was hit in last year's market crisis.
As with any stock, however, investors still favoring gold miners over the metal should pick carefully. Low-cost
producers in resource-rich areas are best. And, ideally, they should have other levers to pull to increase
value.
AngloGold is based in South Africa and enjoys among the lowest unit costs in the industry. Unwinding its
large gold-hedging book should give it better leverage to rising prices for its output. As a sector heavyweight,
it is well-positioned for any consolidation opportunities. Looks like Mr. Paulson might be onto something.

Oracle Foretells the Technology Sector's Future for Payouts
It may be time for tech companies to turn their talent for innovation to figuring out a better use for their
expanding mountains of cash.

--- Page 180 ---
Page 180 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Consider Apple Inc., which finished 2008 with $24.5 billion of cash or short-term investments. That was 59%
more than in 2007 but it is generating next to nothing now that interest rates have plunged.
Apple's cash is equivalent to 28% of its market capitalization. While roughly twice the ratio for Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp., it is well below many others in tech. About 16 tech companies have a net cash balance of
more than half their market capitalization, while 60 have cash of more than 20% of market capitalization,
according to Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch. These include Dell Inc., with $7 billion in net cash,
about 37% of its market capitalization.
Tech companies have traditionally held lots of cash because of the risk in developing new technologies. And
right now, maintaining a healthy cash balance is prudent for anyone.
But much of the tech industry is mature, generating lots of cash. Big tech names should have a plan for using
the money.
One option is acquisitions to diversify or bulk up businesses. That particularly makes sense for companies
where growth is slowing, like Dell or Microsoft. But acquisitions are risky, not least because obvious
public-company targets are trading at premium levels even now.
Take Salesforce.com Inc., which offers Web-based software. It could be attractive for any company wanting
to expand in cloud computing. But Salesforce commands a multiple of 63 times consensus forward earnings
and a market capitalization of $4.3 billion.
Another possible target is Research In Motion Ltd. The BlackBerry maker is worth nearly $24 billion, even
after a stock slide last year, but its earnings multiple is 11.6. It would catapult a deep-pocketed buyer, such as
Microsoft, into a leading position in mobile computing. A less-costly option would be Palm Inc., with a market
cap of $1.1 billion. It has developed a new smart-phone operating system, webOS, but its prospects are
uncertain and a Palm profit is at least a year off.
Smaller purchases may be more cost-effective, particularly of start-up tech companies hungry for money in
the credit crunch. But these would hardly make a dent in cash piles. Stock buybacks could make sense, for
example, where a company's valuation is depressed. It is hard to make that case for healthier tech
companies, like Apple, though.
That is why more should consider a dividend. Oracle Corp., having led the way on acquisitions, declared its
first dividend Wednesday. If Oracle can declare a dividend, Apple and Google should follow.
-- Martin Peers
Too Much
Bark, Not
Enough Bite
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke realizes he can't solve everything by dropping billions of dollars out
of his helicopter. Deep reforms also are needed to fix the system, he said in a speech Friday.
Any moves are welcome. But Mr. Bernanke's prescriptions look too timid.
Take the too-big-to-fail problem. Firms like Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc. were
rescued because authorities believed their failure would imperil the financial system. Mr. Bernanke suggests
five measures: better regulation, better compensation incentives to avoid excessive risk-taking, regulation of
nonbank financial firms, strengthening market structures so one firm's problems don't spill over, and
procedures allowing for the orderly wind down of nonbank financial firms.
Conspicuously absent: Any explicit measure to stop financial firms getting too big. The need for size limits is
pressing, due to recent consolidation. The top-five lenders in the U.S. now account for 70% of the assets at
the top-50 banks, based on SNL Financial data. Regulators may need stronger banks to take over weak ones
right now, but bankers shouldn't be surprised if authorities demand break-ups in the future.
Mr. Bernanke wisely highlighted how creditors underpriced lending to banks because institutions were
considered too big to fail. Disappointingly, he suggested no measures to exert more market discipline on
bank creditors. Last August, Mr. Bernanke held out the possibility of haircutting creditors of failing financial
firms, this time he didn't. Confidence may be too fragile to do that today, but any true reforms would have to
include it.

When the Congressional Budget Office on Friday released a budget forecast considerably gloomier than the
White House's, CBO staffers were in effect tweaking the nose of their old boss. White House Budget Director
Peter Orszag ran the CBO for years before joining the Obama administration. In a response on the White
House Web site, Mr. Orszag said the CBO's projections, "like any budget projections, are subject to a high
degree of uncertainty." As he noted, that's something he knows "quite well" given his employment history.

Stocks in Europe advanced as local investors reacted to the news the Federal Reserve was following in the
Bank of England's footsteps with the direct purchase of $300 billion in long-term Treasury bonds.
Major indexes ended mixed in Asia.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 advanced 0.7% to 171.87, with insurers and miners fronting the
advance.
Insurers are beneficiaries of the rise in bond prices because of the Fed's efforts, since they are the major
bond holders.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 closed up 0.3% to 3816.93, aided by the 13% rise by Prudential PLC as it named
a new chief executive and reported strong operating profit.
FirstGroup climbed 21% as the bus and rail company said annual results were in line with company
expectations. U.K. bus revenue rose 7.3% on a comparable basis, U.K. passenger rail revenue was up 7.6%,
and most of its North American revenue came from contracts that have no exposure to changes in passenger
revenue. At Greyhound, its decision to cut mileage by 7% has helped that unit record profit growth,
FirstGroup said.
In FRANKFURT, the DAX 30 added 1.2% to 4043.46. SAP rose 2.8% after rival Oracle announced its first
dividend payment and recorded flat earnings.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 added 0.6% to 2776.99.
In MADRID, Ferrovial slipped 0.8% as the U.K. Competition Commission ordered its BAA unit to sell three
airports -- London airports Gatwick and Stansted, as well as either Edinburgh or Glasgow, in two years. BAA
called the commission's analysis "flawed" and remedies "impractical in current economic conditions."
Along with Prudential, other insurers also registered strong gains. In AMSTERDAM, Aegon added nearly
11%. In ZURICH, Zurich Financial jumped nearly 12%.
In MILAN, Campari climbed 4.4% as the Italian spirits maker said its annual profit rose 1% on 3% comparable
sales growth and that it kept its dividend stable.
The company said it will maintain a "very cautious stance" through the year, though pressure on stock levels
should ease.
Asian banking shares mostly rose on the Federal Reserve's plan to buy Treasurys, but exporters were hurt by
the dollar's weakening against Asian currencies, leaving regional indexes mixed.
Asian shares were mixed in early Friday trading, with Wall Street's pullback crimping financial stocks. But
soaring metal prices underpinned miners in Australia, which was down 0.1%. South Korea gained 0.7%.
Activity was muted with Japan's markets closed for Vernal Equinox Day.
In TOKYO on Thursday, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies fell 0.3% to 7945.96 after rising more
than 10% in the previous four sessions.
Among banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rose 2.3% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group rose 5.4%.
Export decliners included Toyota Motor, which gave up 2.1%, and Honda Motor, down 3%. Casio Computer
shares fell 14% after the company said it expected a net loss for the fiscal year ending in March.

In SYDNEY, the S&P/ASX 200 rose 1% to 3480.20. Gold miners rose, even as the price of the metal pulled
back in Asian trading hours. Both Newcrest Mining and Lihir Gold added 5.5%. National Australia Bank rose
1.6%.
Telstra fell 2.3% as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission instituted proceedings against the
company for alleged breach of certain obligations related to Telstra's network.
In SHANGHAI, the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.9% to 2265.76, its fourth consecutive rise. Optimism
over China's economic outlook drove up cyclical stocks such as mining and shipping companies. Zijin Mining
Group rose 4.8%, China Cosco Holdings advanced 5.4%, and Shandong Gold-Mining climbed 7.9%.
The advances by banking shares reflected expectations of further improvement in the U.S. financial system
following the Fed's announcement.
In TAIPEI, Cathay Financial Holding jumped 5.5%.
In SINGAPORE, DBS Group Holdings rose 4.2%.
In HONG KONG, HSBC Holdings fell 2.8% as investors pocketed profits after seven straight sessions of
advances. China Huiyuan Juice Group plunged 42% a day after Beijing rejected Coca-Cola's $2.4 billion bid
for the juice maker.
In SEOUL, Hyundai Motor fell 4.6% and LG Electronics declined 5.4%.

Oil and Gold Rally; Is It Overdone?

Commodities markets from crude oil to gold to grains rallied a day after the Federal Reserve's move to
support the economy, but some question the sustainability of the gains in some markets.
Commodities are reacting to the possibility that the Fed's move could spur inflation, but analysts say that if
there are no signs of economic recovery, long-term strength could be muted.
Crude oil closed above $50 a barrel for the first time this year, rising $3.47, or 7.2%, to settle at $51.61 a
barrel. The $50 level could spur airlines and other consumers to start hedging fuel costs more aggressively
out of fear prices have resumed an upward trend, said Morgan Downey, a director and commodities trader at
Standard Chartered in New York.
Nearby March gold on the Comex division of the Nymex surged $69.60 per troy ounce to $958.30 and March
silver jumped $1.5500 an ounce to $13.5000. Copper rose 8.90 cents per pound to $1.7980. Other big
commodity gainers were Chicago Board of Trade May corn, up 9.50 cents to $4.2825 a bushel and ICE
Futures U.S. May cocoa, up $140 to $2,591 a metric ton.
Gold built on the rally first begun in the Wednesday after-hours trade after the Fed move, with market
observers saying another run at $1,000 is likely. The developments this week are certainly for bullish gold,
but Bill O'Neill, a principal with Logic Advisors, suggested the reaction "is a little bit overdone in the short
term." The Fed moves may lead to inflation, he said, but only on a long-term basis and not in the immediate
future.
The fact the global economy is still in a recession is a major factor for some markets, like grains and oilseeds,
which still suffer from demand problems, said John Kleist, broker and analyst with Allendale Inc., in McHenry,
Ill.
"Demand continues to struggle in the grain sector aside from old-crop soybeans," Mr. Kleist said, "and when
the smoke clears, the U.S. is not running out of supplies and the financial industry still has a multitude of
problems."

Fed Skeptics Punish Stocks, Dollar --- Inflation Fears Return as Investors Seek Safe Havens; Dow Falls 85.78

Fed Skeptics Punish Stocks, Dollar --- Inflation Fears Return as Investors Seek Safe Havens; Dow
Falls 85.78

One day after the Federal Reserve strode into uncharted territory with a plan to buy Treasury bonds,
investors remained more unnerved than inspired by its bold move.
Rather than ignite optimism among investors, the Fed's plan rekindled their fears about inflation, since the
central bank is printing money and pumping it into the economy.
The dollar was the main casualty, extending its losses against a range of currencies. Traditional hedges
against rising prices -- among them gold, silver and oil -- rose.
Stocks fell, erasing some of the gains they registered in the wake of Wednesday's announcement. Some
traders blamed skepticism about whether the Fed's bond purchases will work, while others said that stocks
were due for a pause after their torrid rally in recent days.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 85.78 points, or 1.2%, to close at 7400.80. Banking components led
the decline, with Citigroup slipping 15%, Bank of America falling 10%, and J.P. Morgan Chase off 8%.
"It's difficult to visualize the market running straight up from here because of the absence of fundamental
good news from companies, because of the geopolitical risks, which are very much evolving and because of
the potential threat of increased inflation," said Lawrence Creatura, portfolio manager at Federated
Investors.
Gold futures jumped to a three-week high, gaining almost 8% for $958.30 per troy ounce. Silver futures
surged 13%, their largest one-day percentage gain in over two decades. The price of oil rose to its highest
level this year, floating above $50 a barrel to $51.61.
After rallying sharply on Wednesday, the prices of Treasury bonds fell as investors took profits, lifting their
yields. Some investors say the government's buying program may be too small to have much of an impact.
The program's size is relatively tiny compared to the $6 trillion market value of outstanding Treasurys and the
Treasury Department is ratcheting up its sales to help finance the government's stimulus programs. Just next
week, for example, the Treasury will sell $98 billion of government notes.
"Treasurys are relinquishing a teaspoon of the exuberance that was on display post-Fed decision as calmer
heads prevail," said Eric Lascelles, chief economics and rates strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.
The Fed's plan continued to roil currency markets, where investors and analysts raced to adjust their bets
and forecasts in the wake of Wednesday's surprise announcement.
The dollar slumped 1.3% against the euro and 1.7% against the Japanese yen from a day earlier. It is on
track to record its worst week against the European currency since the euro's inception a decade ago.
Currencies with strong links to commodity prices -- like the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar -- also
fared well against the greenback.
The goal of the Fed's move, to push down interest rates, could be salutary for the economy but also means
that foreign investors have less incentive to hold interest-bearing investments in dollars.

What Goes Down Must Come Up:
The Case for a Strengthened Dollar
---
Sure, the Fed's Printing Billions, but Buck's Merits Endure
The Federal Reserve's announcement of plans to buy $300 billion in Treasurys resulted in a predictable
selloff in the dollar, and an equally predictable gnashing of teeth and rending of garments from those who
believe the Fed's efforts signal the dollar's doom.
That may be an overstatement, but the sharp decline in the dollar against other major currencies and the
run-up in hard assets such as oil (which rose to more than $50 a barrel Thursday) and gold (which reversed
a bearish trend, gaining nearly $70 an ounce) suggest investor views, at least in the near future, have turned
decidedly negative on the dollar.
But the hysterical reaction to the Fed's actions are a bit much. Clearly, for the short term, technical traders
and momentum investors will reap rewards by going against the dollar in favor of the euro or yen. However,
the dollar mightn't decline to levels seen in the summer of 2008 (when the euro was worth more than $1.50)
because of expectations for the U.S. economy and the expectation that the Fed's actions will remain limited in
scope.
"If you start to see signs that the economy is nearing the bottom, you have a lot of assets that will have
relatively high rates of return, and that's going to bring capital inflows into the U.S. at a time when the
current-account deficit is getting smaller," says Jay Bryson, global economist at Wachovia. He believes,
however, that the dollar will go down in the short term -- but that the prevailing trend of dollar strength will
remain intact.
Worries about inflation as a result of the Federal Reserve's efforts in reinflating the value of assets through
Treasury purchases ran rampant, and even those who believe the dollar will remain strong when compared
with other currencies say this elixir wouldn't be a desired policy option in stronger markets. "In the mess we're
in now, we can afford to do this, and we should without fear of deflation," says Carl Weinberg, chief
economist at High Frequency Economics.
Mr. Weinberg believes that, despite the stimulus undertaken by monetary authorities, the level of bank
lending remains so depressed that the Fed's efforts won't unduly create an inflation problem, particularly in
the near term. The velocity of money -- the average frequency with which money is being spent over time --
remains low, despite the creation of money by the Fed, and because of that, the concern that inflation will
result should remain low, for now. "People with cash are not lending it out to other people," he notes.
Eventually, he and others say, inflation could become a problem. Analysts at Scotia Capital believe the
dollar's fundamentals are poor, but that worries about the global economy could continue to support the
dollar. Mr. Weinberg, however, believes the Fed will intervene to reverse the effect of its recent efforts if
inflation becomes a problem, and if it does so too slowly, it would affect the dollar, and prove those
concerned correct. But that will take more time.

In case there was any residual doubt, the Bernanke Fed threw itself all in this week to unlock financial
markets and spur the economy. With its announced plan to make a mammoth purchase of Treasury
securities, the Fed essentially said that the considerable risks of future inflation and permanent damage to
the Fed's political independence are details that can be put off, or cleaned up, at a later date. Whatever else
people will say about his chairmanship, Ben Bernanke does not want deflation or Depression on his resume.
It's important to understand the historic nature of what the Fed is doing. In buying $300 billion worth of
long-end Treasurys, it is directly monetizing U.S. government debt. This is what the Federal Reserve did
during World War II to finance U.S. government borrowing, before the Fed broke the pattern in a very public
spat with the Truman Administration during the Korean War. Now the Bernanke Fed is once again making
itself a debt agent of the Treasury, using its balance sheet to finance Congressional spending.
It is also monetizing U.S. debt indirectly with the huge expansion of its direct purchase program of
mortgage-backed securities (MBS). It was $500 billion, and now it will add $750 billion more "this year."
Foreign governments have been getting out of Fannie and Freddie MBSs in recent months and going into
Treasurys. Thus the Fed is essentially substituting as these foreign governments finance U.S. debt by buying
presumably safer Treasurys.
The purpose of these actions is to keep rates low on both Treasurys and MBSs, and to keep the cost of funds
low for banks and especially for home buyers. It worked on Tuesday; long bond and mortgage rates fell.
The case for doing all this is that the Fed needs to supply dollars at a time when money velocity is low and
the world demand for dollars is high amid the global recession. As long as the world keeps demanding
dollars, the Fed can get away with this extraordinary credit creation. That said, bear in mind that the Fed's
balance sheet has more than doubled since September -- to $1.9 trillion from $900 billion. These latest
commitments mean it may more than double again, close to $4 trillion. That would be about 30% of GDP, up
from about 7%.
The market reaction clearly showed the implied risks, with gold leaping and the dollar taking a dive the past
two days. As the economy improves, and thus as the velocity of money increases, the risk of inflation will
soar. Mr. Bernanke says the Fed can remove the money fast, but central bankers always say that and rarely
do. The Fed statement isn't reassuring on that point. It says, "the Committee sees some risk that inflation
could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term."
The Fed seems to be saying it wants a little inflation, which we know from history can easily become a big
inflation or another asset bubble. The last time the Fed cut rates to very low levels to fight "deflation," we
ended up with the housing bubble and mortgage mania.
The other great, and less appreciated, danger is political. The Bernanke Fed has now dropped even the
pretense of independence and has made itself an agent of the Treasury, which means of politicians. With its
many new credit facilities -- the TALF and the others -- it is making credit allocation decisions across the
economy. If a business borrower qualifies for one of these facilities, it gets cheaper money. If it doesn't, it's
out of luck. Thus the scramble by so many nonbanks to become bank holding companies, so they can tap the
Fed's well of cheap credit.
The question is how the Fed will withdraw from all of this unchartered territory now that it has moved into it.
How will it wean companies off easy credit, especially since some companies may need it to survive? What
happens when Members of Congress lobby the Fed to keep credit loose for auto loans to help Detroit, or
credit cards to help Amex? House Speaker Pelosi yesterday gave a taste, saying the AIG bailout was the
Fed's idea "without any prior notification to us." Mr. Bernanke, meet your new partners.
Above all, the Treasury and Congress won't be happy if the Fed decides to stop buying Treasurys and the
result is a big increase in government borrowing costs. This was the source of the dispute between the

Federal Reserve and the Truman Treasury. The Fed wanted to raise rates amid rising inflation, while the
Truman Treasury wanted cheap financing for Korea and its domestic priorities. The Fed prevailed in the
famous "Accord" of 1951, thanks to a young assistant secretary of the Treasury named William McChesney
Martin. He would go on to become Fed Chairman and create the modern era of Fed independence. The U.S.
and the Fed are going to need another Martin, sooner rather than later.

Treasurys, Stocks Applaud the Fed --- Thirst for Government Paper Sends Yields Down Hard; Dow Rises 90.88

Treasurys, Stocks Applaud the Fed --- Thirst for Government Paper Sends Yields Down Hard; Dow
Rises 90.88

The Federal Reserve's unexpectedly aggressive bond-market intervention plan was great news for Treasury
bonds and good news for stocks, but downright bad news for the dollar.
The 10-year Treasury note surged in price, pushing down the note's yield more sharply than any day after the
1987 stock-market crash. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.88 points.
"This is an affirmation that the Fed is pulling out all the stops in terms of utilizing monetary policy" in an
effort to loosen up credit markets, said Gordon Fowler, chief investment officer at Philadelphia
money-management firm Glenmede Trust, which oversees $16 billion. "Now the question is how much do
these measures affect the real economy, are we at a floor in the housing market and can we provide normal
amounts of credit to the housing sector?"
Outside the Treasury market, there were signs that some investors were waiting to see whether the Fed
action would succeed in its primary aims: getting credit markets back to normal and lowering borrowing costs
for everyone from businesses to home buyers, which is essential for a lasting economic recovery.
After surging immediately following the Fed's announcement that it would buy up Treasury bonds and
mortgage-backed securities, stocks gave back some of their gains by the close. The Fed is hoping that, by
pushing Treasury yields lower, it will entice investors to buy nongovernment bonds, with their higher yields.
On Wednesday, many corporate bonds gained in price, sending their yields lower, but the move was small in
comparison with Treasury bonds.
The Dow's 90.88-point or 1.23% rise, to 7486.58, means it is now up 14% from the 12-year closing low hit on
March 9. The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index, which rose 2.09% to 794.35, has risen 17% from its own
12-year closing low that same day. Trading on the NYSE was the heaviest of the year.
The dollar suffered, with the euro staging its biggest one-day percentage gain against the greenback since
the pan-European currency was created 10 years ago. The dollar also fell sharply against many other
currencies. The problem: The Fed is trying to drive market interest rates lower, meaning that investors will
get lower rates on dollar-denominated securities. Buying Treasurys is also akin to printing money, leading
investors to worry again about troublesome inflation down the road.
The euro rallied 3.7% from Tuesday.
For the dollar, the Fed's move is "just too much," said John Taylor, who heads FX Concepts, a currency
hedge fund, in a brief conversation before he rushed to adjust his fund's bets. "The dollar is going to get
clubbed."
Gold futures benefited from the fears of inflation. Down before the Fed announcement, the futures jumped
5.7% during after-hours electronic trading.
Bank stocks once again turned in strong gains, with Bank of America up 22%, Citigroup rising 23% and J.P.
Morgan Chase ahead 8%.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.533% from 3.003% late Tuesday. The two-year note gained
about half a point in price, to yield 0.826%, from 1.037% Tuesday.
The move in Treasurys was as significant as if the Fed had cut the fed-funds target rate by three quarters of
a percentage point, said Ethan Harris, U.S. economist at Barclays Capital.

Prices also rose, and yields fell, on securities backed by mortgage loans that conform to Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac's standards -- bonds the Fed said it would continue to buy to drive down mortgage costs for
home buyers.
While many analysts said the Fed had no choice but to step up its efforts, they worried that the Fed's move
could be another sign of economic weakness.
It is a "shocking out-loud admission" that credit markets remain troubled, said Brian Battle at bond firm
Performance Trust Capital Partners.

Gold futures staged an about-face to move higher in thinly traded after-hours screen trading after a surprise
statement from the Federal Open Market Committee that pressured the dollar and rekindled longer-term
inflation concerns.
Gold had settled lower in the open-outcry session, with nearby March gold futures down $27.70 to $888.70
an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The most-active April contract fell $27.70 to $889.10. The weakness was triggered by an abatement of recent
flight-to-safety buying as financial stocks kept improving and by sell stops, preplaced orders triggered when
certain chart points are hit.
But in electronic trading two hours after gold's official close, the April contract had reversed and traded at
$940.10, a rise of 5.7% from the session's close. The catalyst was steps announced by the Fed in its efforts
to revive the economy, including plans to buy long-term Treasurys and more mortgage-backed securities.
"The dollar is getting whacked," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with FuturePath Trading. "It's the
fact they're going to buy Treasurys. That's a surprise to everybody." Investors often buy gold as a hedge
against dollar weakness.
Investors also buy gold as an inflation hedge, and that also came into play, said Andrew Montano, director
of precious metals at Scotia Mocatta.
The market perceived the Fed announcement as a "massive expansion" of the Fed's balance sheet and a
rise in the money supply, he said, adding, "Inflation worries would be the primary issue." This prompted
heavy buying in gold, with buy stops triggered, he said.
George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures, also cited short covering, in which
traders buy to offset positions in which they previously went short, or sold, the metal.
Gold's sharp turn around in after-hours trading could make it ripe for a pull back.
"You might need some consolidation," said Stephen Platt, analyst with Archer Financial Services. But gold
support is coming on expectations of a weaker dollar as the Fed is "trying to pump as much money into the
system" as it can, Mr. Platt said. "You would think it would be inflationary."
The gold decline during the regular-hours session was the largest one-day dollar and percentage drop since
Jan. 12, and the lowest settlement since Jan. 28.
It put gold prices down 11.4% from the exchange-record close of $1,003.20 hit on March 18, 2008.
Comex silver for March delivery fell 73.5 cents per troy ounce, or 5.79% to $11.950, down for the third
straight session and 9.7% over the past three sessions.
In other commodities markets Wednesday:
CRUDE OIL: Prices retreated a day after flirting with $50 a barrel as data put U.S. crude stockpiles at the
fullest since June 2007. The Department of Energy said crude inventories last week rose an unexpectedly
large two million barrels to 353.3 million barrels. Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell $1.02, or 2.1%, to
$48.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

NATURAL GAS: Prices fell to the lowest in over six years, since Sept. 25, 2002, dragged down by slumping
oil prices amid ample gas supplies, weak demand and mild temperatures. Natural gas for April delivery on
Nymex fell 12.8 cents, or 3.4%, to $3.684 a million British thermal units.

Can Palm Squeeze the BlackBerry?
Judging by its recent rally, Palm Inc., a pioneer of hand-held devices, is about to mount a John Travolta-style
comeback. BlackBerry's maker, Research In Motion Ltd., in contrast, is trading like its disco days are over.
RIM's stock, essentially flat after plunging 70% last year, is selling at about 12 times consensus earnings for
its fiscal year ended February 2009. (Apple Inc. is trading at 19.7 times fiscal 2009 consensus.)
Palm, meanwhile, is unencumbered by multiples given the expectation it will lose $2.02 a share this fiscal
year, and lose money again next year. Its fivefold share-price jump since December is all about faith in its
coming Pre smart phone and the brand-new operating system that supports it, webOS.
That bet made sense when Palm's market capitalization was $160 million. It looks less obvious at $1.1 billion.
While it is tricky to guess consumer demand for a new device, the Pre faces some obstacles.
It initially will be distributed exclusively in the U.S. by Sprint Nextel Corp., a weak carrier. Second, kinks could
emerge in webOS once the phone hits the market.
More worrisome, Palm has little to fall back on if the Pre doesn't sell. Demand for its older phones, such as
the Centro, has fallen so much that the company has said revenue in the quarter ended in February is
expected to drop by more than two-thirds.
Palm's financial condition is precarious: It used close to $100 million in the quarter, nearly half its Nov. 30
cash reserves, although it recently raised more than that from shareholders.
There is reason to be bearish about RIM, the No. 2 smart-phone player behind Nokia Corp., with 19.5% of
world-wide sales in the fourth quarter of 2008, Gartner estimates. It stumbled with its touch-screen debut, the
Storm. The marketplace is crowded: Dell Inc. might jump in, and Apple continues to fine-tune its iPhone
software, releasing a new version on Tuesday.
While the global smart-phone market is expected to expand this year, the extra supply may give wireless
carriers clout to squeeze prices. RIM's margins already have come down as more-sophisticated phones,
which are costlier to make, account for a rising share of its sales.
Even so, it is way too early to write off BlackBerry's maker. If RIM can continue to ramp up volume, it can
offset lower margins. More important, despite the proliferation of new smart phones, no one yet has come
close to eroding BlackBerry's competitive edge, the security and efficiency of its email application. That is
what won BlackBerry an enormous installed base in the U.S. corporate sector.
It is easy to be seduced by the promise of the hot new device. In this case, however, sticking with RIM looks
a better bet then grabbing hold of Palm.
-- Martin Peers
Congested Citi Jams the Short Sellers
First, shareholders were burned by Citigroup Inc.'s offer to swap $27.5 billion of preferred securities for
common stock.
Now, it is short sellers in the hot seat.
Thanks to sweet conversion terms in the February offer, investors holding the preferreds could short the
common stock to lock in a likely profit. That lured in a flood of arbitragers and pummeled the shares.

--- Page 200 ---
Page 200 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But Citi's stock has tripled since March 5. Even with short sellers now willing to pay through the nose to
borrow stock, the supply has virtually dried up. The result: a short squeeze exacerbated by a series of bullish
comments from banking executives.
Some arbitragers, with memories of last year's Volkswagen pileup and fears that brokers might force them to
return borrowed stock, have rushed to close positions.
That has made the trade appear juicier for new investors. Last Friday, one Citi 8.125% Series AA preferred
security could be bought for $12, but was exchangeable for a fixed 7.3 shares of common stock valued at
$13. Now, the preferreds are valued at $13, but 7.3 shares of common are $22.
The spread implies an absolute return of about 70% in a matter of weeks if Citigroup sticks to its plan. Risks
include a change in the terms if, say, the government decides to take a larger equity stake.
A few arbitragers still are playing. A large prime broker said Tuesday that a client borrowed five million Citi
shares at an annualized interest rate of 120% to go short.
At those rates, Citi shareholders might decide lending out their stock isn't such a bad idea after all.
-- John Jannarone
Sun Rises on Tech Deals
Any time an industry is dominated by cash-rich but growth-poor companies, conditions are ripe for
consolidation. Today, that is true even of tech, as International Business Machines Corp.'s takeover
discussions with Sun Microsystems Inc. demonstrate.
World-wide server revenue fell 15% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period, Gartner Inc.
estimates. Of the top five vendors, IBM, down 17%, and Sun, down 15%, were the hardest hit.
Both IBM and Sun have big exposure to the shrinking Unix server market. For IBM, then, the acquisition
offers a way to quickly capture cost savings, particularly as Sun's operating expenses have been out of line
with revenue. Sanford C. Bernstein &Co. analyst Toni Sacconaghi notes that 12 of the top 100 tech
companies by market capitalization have gross margins between 40% and 50%, in line with Sun. But only two
of those, including Sun, have operating margins below 10%.
Sun holds other opportunities for IBM: Sun is stronger in industries like telecom. Sun's small but expanding
software business, including the Java platform, also has value.
IBM may get Sun for about $6.5 billion, net of cash in Sun's coffers, which is a little more than half Bernstein's
projection for IBM's net income this year. Two years ago, Sun would have cost more than twice as much.
The tech deal wave may be just beginning.

Federal Reserve
Slaps Paper
Over the Cracks
The problem with desperate measures: They can end up stoking fear, not confidence.
That is the main risk with the Federal Reserve's tactic of buying $300 billion in long-term Treasurys and up to
$1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The 10-year Treasury price jumped, causing the yield to fall almost half a percentage point to 2.533%. But
two fear indicators flashed red after the announcement: Gold soared 6% and the dollar weakened.
It is unusual for a central bank to print money to buy large amounts of financial assets. Such unorthodoxy
succeeds only if its purchases are temporary, and sufficient to kick-start credit markets and the economy.
Any sign their impact is fleeting would raise expectations of further buying. If the Fed responds and balloons
its balance sheet, inflation fears intensify, hurting the dollar and pushing gold higher.
The Fed's $300 billion would account for about 28% of government issuance in the next six months,
according to Barclays Capital. To keep yields low beyond that might mean heavier spending. The Fed's
decision to expand the purchase of mortgage-backed securities underscores its willingness to keep spending.

--- Page 201 ---

Investors should track the relationship between the dollar and Treasury yields. Ultraloose monetary policy
can debase the currency. That means foreigners, with about half outstanding Treasurys, could demand
higher returns.
Yields are now artificially low because of proposed Fed intervention. That might push investors into riskier
assets, which the Fed wants. It also could scare foreign investors, who are needed to fund the ballooning
fiscal deficit.
-- Peter Eavis
Overheard
That was quick. A day after hedge-fund manager John Paulson snapped up an 11% stake in South Africa's
AngloGold Ashanti, it was a golden trade already, courtesy of the Fed's decision to crank up the printing
presses by buying Uncle Sam's debt. Inflationary fears prompted gold to erase a 3.3% price fall earlier in the
day and notch a small gain. His gain was even more impressive. Based on a purchase price of $32 a share
and a 9.2% jump in AngloGold's American depositary receipts, he is sitting on a tidy profit of $231 million.

Accountants don't have the greatest track record when it comes to disclosing frauds. Wednesday, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants said it had expelled David Friehling, whose firm was the
longtime auditor for Bernard Madoff's company. The move came after an ethics inquiry by the group. Better
late than never.

Washington Has Always Demonized Wall Street

'Wall Street, as we knew it, is dead. The system that allowed the U.S. economy to be a dynamic innovator
has been fundamentally broken and the implications of these structural changes have yet to be fully felt."
It's now commonly accepted that the economic meltdown has forever changed the nature of the financial
industry. But the words above weren't written in the past weeks. They were penned by financial analyst
Richard Wayman in 2003, after investigations by then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer led to a
structural shift in the relationship between research and investment banking following the stock-market
collapse of 2001-02.
Among the many remarkable aspects of our present crisis is the speed with which we have collectively
forgotten past crises, even ones that happened recently. The current meltdown is substantial, dramatic, and
systemically dangerous -- but it is hardly the first to merit that description. And each crisis, without fail, results
in unequivocal pronouncements that such excesses will never again be allowed.
When President Barack Obama lambastes Wall Street bonuses as "shameful," he is keeping up with the
American tradition of vilifying Wall Street. Almost since the founding of the country, the U.S. has oscillated
between admiration and condemnation of money men. When the first Bank of the United States was
established in Philadelphia in 1791, it was amid fears that it would allow merchants and speculators to
subvert the new republic for their own gain. Decades later, Andrew Jackson's presidency was bolstered by
his staunch opposition to the Second Bank of the United States. He positioned himself as the defender of the
common man against supporters of the bank who used their money to obtain influence.
From the 19th century to the present day, denunciation of financiers has gone hand in hand with each
recession, speculative bust and depression. Each time the economy falls, the chattering classes announce
that the old ways have brought the country to the brink of ruin and that the riches of society will no longer
remain in the hands of the greedy few.
Little recalled now is "The Long Depression" of the 1870s that began with the Panic of 1873. The Panic was
triggered by the collapse of the Jay Cooke and Company Bank, which came on the heels of Jay Gould's
infamous attempt to corner the national gold market in 1869 and the speculative boom in railroad building.
During the 1870s, as much as 50% of the U.S. labor force was out of work at one time or another, making it
by far the worst economic collapse in the country's history. In the agrarian heartland of the country, early
stirrings of populism led to attacks on eastern barons for robbing Americans of their birthright.
From then on, busts followed almost like clockwork every 20 years, with the panics of 1873 and 1877
followed by the panic of 1893 and then the "Bankers' Panic" of 1907, when J.P. Morgan orchestrated the
recapitalization of the financial system from his mansion in Manhattan. It was the TARP, the "bad bank," and
the stimulus of its day, and it earned Morgan the gratitude of a nation and the applause of President
Theodore Roosevelt.
Having lionized Morgan, a few years later the country turned on him and his ilk with a vengeance. In 1913, a
populist congressman from Louisiana, Arsene Pujo, launched an investigation of the so-called "Money Trust"
that he claimed was exerting undue and deleterious influence on the body politic. Exhibit No. 1 was none
other than one-time savior Morgan, who was interrogated by the committee as if he had committed a heinous
crime. One member of the committee said Morgan represented "a moneyed oligarchy more despotic and
dangerous to industrial freedom than anything civilization has ever known." Strict regulations followed -- as
they always have on the heels of such crises.
Yet 20 years later, the market imploded with the crash of 1929. The ranks of the unemployed swelled to at
least 25%, and the country was plunged into the Great Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt famously
indicted the "money changers" in his 1933 inaugural address, but he was even more caustic in private,
vowing to end forever "speculation with other people's money." The raft of modern regulatory institutions,

--- Page 204 ---

from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was one result.
Wall Street was tamed and quiet for a while.
Later on, the "Go-Go" years of Wall Street in the late 1960s quickly gave way to the bust of the so-called
"Nifty-Fifty," the 50 largest blue-chip companies. Then came inflation, severe unemployment, and the stock
market collapse of 1973-74. Between 1964 and 1982, the major stock indices went nowhere fast -- the Dow
began that period at about 800 and ended at the same. Wall Street in those years was more of a cottage
industry, one that few suspected would again return to its prominent and controversial position at the apex of
American society.
The booming 1980s -- mergers and acquisitions and arbitrage -- were capped by the highly publicized trials of
Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, who were pursued by the Eliot Spitzer of his day, Rudy Giuliani. Combined
with the market crash of 1987, the subsequent Savings and Loan debacle (which had little to do with Wall
Street per se, but was wrapped up with the same crowd in public imagining), and the recession of 1991-92,
Wall Street was once again pronounced immoral and in need of tight reins. Yet within a few years, the
Nasdaq was soaring, animal spirits were in control, and the Internet bubble was in full bloom.
Wall Street's obituary has been written many times. Yet what is striking today is that cycles that used to take
a few decades now take a few years. And our cultural amnesia has gotten worse. The rapid sequence of the
dot-com bubble of the 1990s, the recession of 2001, and the 2002 collapse of Enron combined with major
fines levied against investment banks, all became a distant echo in a surprisingly short amount of time. At the
rate we've been going, we're due for a new boom with obscene profits for the financial industry -- albeit with
different names and different companies -- before Mr. Obama runs for re-election.
The fact that we have been in similar places in the past doesn't make the specific problems we face any less
pressing. New regulations may prevent an exact recurrence of yesterday's crises, but our relentless capacity
for reinvention means that we will produce innovations that will in turn create new problems.
Recognizing that our present is not quite so breathlessly unprecedented doesn't make the challenges less
critical, but it could lead to a more level approach. That can begin with steady leadership from President
Obama. Wall Street has been humbled and will change, but capital will continue to flow. That much, at least,
is certain.

Is Inflation Baked Into the Budget Plan?
Is Inflation Baked Into the Budget Plan?

Trust, honesty, accountability -- these are the watchwords of President Barack Obama's administration. In his
inaugural speech, Mr. Obama made it clear that these principles are especially applicable to fiscal and
budgetary matters. "Those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account -- to spend wisely,
reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day -- because only then can we restore the vital trust
between a people and their government."
Fiscal accountability is imperative because when government spends more than its citizens can afford, it
hollows out the productive capabilities of the nation. Resources that should be used to create new wealth are
allocated to pay interest on accumulated debt; instead of investing in tomorrow, people must labor to pay
yesterday's bills. When deficit spending is accommodated by loose monetary policy, it leads to internal
bankruptcy -- indeed, whole nations have foundered on this path.
Which is why the Obama administration should be asked to provide assurances it won't compromise the
integrity of our money as it strives to implement its $3.9 trillion budget and simultaneously reduce the deficit.
We cannot balance the budget by resorting to the dodge of inflation. Fiscal honesty demands a meaningful
measure of value, an honest dollar.
Therefore, it is crucial that as Mr. Obama talks up his blueprint for reducing the deficit from 12.3% of GDP to
a mere 3% within the next four years, the underlying economic assumptions that drive his projections are
subjected to close scrutiny. One factor that tends to get overlooked is that the year-to-year growth in
projected GDP is a function of two estimates: real growth and inflation. It is the combination of these two
estimates that provides the budget number that serves as the denominator for calculating the deficit as a
percentage of GDP.
Here's an example of some fuzzy math: The Obama budget shows GDP at $14.240 trillion in 2009 and
projects it at $17.498 trillion in 2013. In other words, it projects that the total value of U.S. economic output
will increase by 23% over the next four years, i.e., it will be nearly one-quarter larger. The projected deficit for
2013 is $533 billion in the Obama budget; hence, $533 billion divided by $17.498 trillion is 3% -- voila! the
impressive deficit-at-3%-of-GDP claim four years out.
The trick lies in getting a big number for GDP growth, and the fudge factor arises from assigning relative
weights for real growth versus inflationary growth. The Obama budget assumes 70% of the increase can be
attributed to real growth, 30% from inflation.
The fact that the mainstream summary of private economic forecasts known as the Blue Chip Consensus
predicts nominal GDP in 2013 will be $730 billion lower than does the Obama budget -- and also assumes
lower real growth and higher inflation across the same four-year period -- was dismissed not long ago by
Christina Romer, chair of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. "We are economists and not
soothsayers," she quipped.
Economists are notorious for disagreeing with each other, true. If you were to poll economists right now
whether the bigger threat on the horizon is deflation or inflation -- you would receive a continuum of opinions.
But what most Americans are concerned about, it's safe to say, is not so much the possibility of declining
prices -- after all, lower prices can serve as a stimulus to start buying -- but rather the likelihood that the
purchasing power of their wages and savings will be eroded through inflation. It's small comfort to have more
dollars rounding out the economy these next few years if those dollars are worth less. So it very much
matters how much of the projected growth touted in the Obama budget will turn out to be real, and how much
is apt to be achieved through money illusion.

Economists may not be soothsayers, but they should strive to be truth tellers. It's one thing to claim that the
dollar value U.S. economic output will be one-quarter higher in four years; it's quite another to suggest that
the U.S. GDP in 2013 will be worth one-quarter more.
Can the president's economic team definitively state that inflation is not baked into the plan? Would Mr.
Obama be willing to guarantee the stable purchasing power of the dollar?
The notion that monetary policy might be in cahoots with fiscal policy is sure to elicit howls of protest all the
way from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve -- about a mile's distance. But no one can seriously suggest
that the Fed has not been politicized beyond all pretenses toward independence. The Fed has become a key
player in the government's efforts to deal with the credit crisis, purchasing hundreds of billions in
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by federal agencies and taking them onto its own balance sheet.
Last month the Fed issued a joint statement with Treasury that they stood ready to inject more capital into
banks "to provide a cushion against larger-than-expected future losses." And according to yesterday's
surprise announcement, the Fed now plans to buy up long-term Treasury bonds -- an act of fiscal incest --
while taking another $1 trillion or so onto its balance sheet to boost consumer spending.
So the Fed is involved up to its neck in this blueprint for the future. Does anyone doubt that former Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers, who heads the White House's Economic Council, is slated to be the next Fed
chairman?
All of which brings into urgent focus the need to put down a marker for sound money. How can capitalism find
its footing when the monetary foundation is shifting with each new government bailout -- each new infusion of
deficit-financed government expenditure? American families deserve better than to be punished by wasteful
public spending and ruinous inflation.
We must require the Obama administration to abide by its professed willingness to be held to account. We
should demand a new form of savings bond from the government aimed at safeguarding the purchasing
power of the currency. "Make the dollar, once again, an honest dollar," Jack Kemp urged as a Republican
candidate for president in 1988. "The dollar should be so trustworthy, so predictable, so lasting in value, that
it's as good as gold." Thirty years later, gold remains a surrogate for long-term confidence in U.S. fiscal
policies. Judging from the steep rise in the dollar price of gold -- and runaway sales of gold coins -- the
verdict is not positive.
It is time to take a stand. Honest money is essential to an honest budget; we need to safeguard the integrity
of America's currency. As Republicans put forward an alternative blueprint for America's future based on
pro-growth tax policies and entitlement reform, they should also seek to pass legislation authorizing the
issuance of gold-backed Treasury bonds -- payable at maturity in dollars or ounces of gold, at the option of
the holder.
A limited issuance of gold-backed Treasury bonds would serve as a sign to U.S. citizens that the dollar will
not be the default mechanism for governmental excesses. "The Honest Dollar Act" will function as a
barometer measuring the fiscal rectitude of the Obama administration. If the promised deficit reduction has
been sufficiently accomplished to stem inflationary fears, holders of gold-backed Treasury obligations are
unlikely to redeem in gold; after all, gold pays no interest and normally engenders warehousing costs.
Unless the utter lack of progress toward fiscally conservative goals has unleashed even more egregious
levels of deficit spending, repayment in dollars will be preferred. But the right to convert the face value of the
note for gold at a fixed rate -- say, $1,000 per troy ounce -- conveys a trust-but-verify provision that marks the
first solid step toward sound money.
As we strive to turn the U.S. economy around, let us not forget that money is a moral contract between
government and citizens -- a key aspect of that "vital trust" between a people and their government to which
Mr. Obama so powerfully subscribes. And which we must uphold.

Ratings Can Spark Triple Trouble
The curse of the triple-A credit rating could be creeping back.
The top-notch rating played a key role in stoking the excesses of the credit bubble. Without it, firms such as
American International Group wouldn't have been able to write the sort of business that ended up blowing big
holes in their balance sheets.
Triple-A also enabled the construction of billions of dollars of structured securities that have since turned
toxic.
Investors have been looking past ratings and focusing more on fundamentals. The prices of credit default
swaps have signaled for months some downgrades of triple-A companies. And last week, Fitch Ratings
downgraded Berkshire Hathaway from triple-A, while Standard &Poor's did the same for General Electric.
But even in these more cautious times, the triple-A rating has the potential to distort key markets and lead to
problems in the future.
Take the growing amount of bank debt issued with a government guarantee, which is typically triple-A-rated.
The guarantee was made available last year as financial firms found it harder to find buyers for their debt.
Since November, banks have issued more than $200 billion, according to SNL Financial.
J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and GE Capital have each sold more than $30 billion of guaranteed
debt. And this debt is dirt cheap. Morgan Stanley, which is rated single-A and has issued nearly $25 billion
under the program, sold a guaranteed bond last week with an interest rate of just 2.25%.
The money is so cheap it could lead some banks again to make bets and loans that later turn out to be
inappropriate. And the low yields could start to lull investors into believing bank balance sheets are in better
shape than they really are. After all, Fitch said in its Berkshire opinion that no financial firm holding company
deserves a triple-A rating due to economic and market stresses.
Although the triple-A rating is tarnished, the government still sees its usefulness. The Federal Reserve's Term
Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, scheduled to be launched this week, lends to investors so that they
can lever up purchases of triple-A-rated asset-backed bonds.
Again, dysfunction could arise. In this market, most investor demand is for triple-A bonds. That means low
yields, which in turn means investors want leverage to magnify them. Such leverage, if taken too far, can
destabilize markets. Even so lenders, in this case the government, will provide it because the bonds are rated
triple-A.
Even U.S. Treasurys, the ultimate triple-A where panicked investors have sought sanctuary, might yet pose a
risk. Sustained fiscal deficits could eventually put the rating in question. With Treasury yields at super-low
levels, that would shock investors. But for years, markets never contemplated a Berkshire downgrade.

The U.K.'s Double Whammy: Banks and Oil
Already reeling from the banking crisis, the U.K. faces another hit from declining oil revenues.
Tax from North Sea oil and the dividends from U.K.-listed energy giants BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among
the few solid revenue streams for both the U.K. Treasury and private pension funds. Yet they are under
pressure.

--- Page 208 ---
Page 208 of 231 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
North Sea oil and gas producers are expected to pay 27% of combined U.K. corporation and petroleum tax
this fiscal year and 20% in 2010, according to the Treasury. Total corporate-tax receipts in January fell 20%
from a year earlier, while the government's liabilities have soared.
Meanwhile, analysts estimate that BP and Shell alone will contribute one-quarter of FTSE-100 dividends in
2009. Most U.K. banks, formerly cash cows for institutional investors, are likely to pay little or no dividend for
years. If the oil industry cut payments, too, it could pile the pressure on already underfunded pension funds.
There's little the government can do to stanch the fall in North Sea production and revenues. Smaller oil
companies' business models have been hammered by high costs, lower oil prices and a financing drought.
Meanwhile, larger operators are diverting capital to promising areas like Angola or Brazil.
Pension trustees can take some comfort from BP's and Shell's promises not to cut dividends this year, but
both companies will be paying with borrowed money. Another few years of lower oil prices will mean a tough
choice between dividends and new investments.
London's financial-services boom and the oil-price surge were twin engines powering the U.K. economy. The
first engine is down; the second is now sputtering.
-- James Herron
NVR's Solid Foundations
Home builders are paying the price for amassing too much pricey land in once-booming markets like
California, Arizona and Florida. As home prices tumble, builders will keep writing down their land.
One bright spot is NVR Inc. Instead of owning land, the company, which does business as Ryan Homes and
NVHomes, optioned housing lots and bought them as needed.
NVR has $163 million in debt, has only about $29 million of option deposits and enjoys a comfortable cash
cushion of $1.15 billion, according to housing-research firm Zelman &Associates. Compare that with builders
Hovnanian Enterprises or Beazer Homes USA, which were hammered by huge land write-downs and high
leverage.
NVR is also one of the largest house builders in Washington, D.C., which is showing some signs of
stabilizing, due to a solid employment outlook. In recent years, it didn't build in Florida and California.
That is reflected in NVR's premium to the sector. But its valuation declined somewhat after last month's big
stock sale by Chairman Dwight Schar. NVR's shares now trade at 1.6 times book value, down from 2 times
book in early January.
Watching a big holder unload stock is always disconcerting, and NVR is hardly foreclosure-sale cheap. But
for those ready to bet on a housing rebound, the company at least has relatively solid foundations.

Balancing Act
For Bonds
Is Delicate
What has positioned itself as both a relatively safe haven and a risky asset class? For now, corporate bonds.
Their mix of corporate exposure and fixed income means they can benefit from bouts of pessimism as well as
rays of hope. For equity-focused investors, they offer lower price volatility and greater security than shares,
ranking higher up the capital structure. Their fixed coupons look attractive with dividends at risk.
Meanwhile, for fixed-income investors, corporate debt's spread over government bonds is the highest since
1932, according to Moody's.
While the S&P 500 is down 16% year-to-date and the 30-year U.S. Treasury yield is up almost 1.0
percentage point (as prices have fallen), nonfinancial corporate bonds have fared better. The spread between
long-term U.S. investment-grade bond yields and 30-year Treasurys has tightened 0.51 percentage point to
3.2 percentage points -- well below December's peak of 4.03 percentage points.
From here, if investors grow more risk-averse, corporate bonds may benefit from further flows out of equities.
But if markets become more willing to take risk and the economy improves, corporate-bond spreads should

tighten, outperforming government bonds. Ultimately, that could be a big comparative move: The average
30-year spread since 1919 is 1.16 percentage points.
That relative attractiveness, however, shouldn't belittle the risks. Corporate cash flows are under pressure
and credit ratings are being cut. The threat of inflation, too, hangs over the bond market. While spreads to
government bonds are wide, the absolute yield on U.S. nonfinancial bonds is 6.8%, only 0.4 percentage point
above their long-run average. They peaked in 1981 at more than 16%.

Dollar, Gold Are Suddenly Inseparable
Abreast of the Market
Dollar, Gold Are Suddenly Inseparable

The dollar and gold are no longer ships passing in the night.
For the better part of this decade, the price of gold and the value of the U.S. dollar tended to move reliably in
opposite directions -- when gold went up, the dollar went down, and vice-versa. The reasoning is that a
weaker dollar can feed into worries about inflation. That in turn prompts investors to turn to gold, a hard
asset in limited supply whose value typically rises in inflationary times.
Lately, though, gold and the dollar have been rising in tandem as frantic investors seek safety from
contracting world economies, teetering banks and radical governments stimulus plans. Investors world-wide
are stashing bullion. At the same time they're buying the U.S. dollar -- the world's so-called reserve currency
held by central banks and institutions -- as worries about other economies escalate.
The strange coupling has puzzled some strategists and investors, and at least some say that the two may
continue to move together for the foreseeable future as investors focus on the perceived strength, or
weakness, of the world's banks and economies.
Since the start of this year, gold prices have risen 5% as the dollar's value against a basket of major
currencies has increased 8%. By contrast, in the last three months of last year, gold fell 4% and the dollar
rose 3% -- following the pattern investors had come to rely on.
The correlation between the two -- a method of measuring the tendency of two assets to move together --
was negative 0.81 from 2006 until late December 2008, according the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. (A
correlation of 1.0 means they move in the unison, while negative 1.0 means the opposite.) From the
beginning of 2009, it has flipped to positive.
The recent coupling "goes against the economic theory, so now you have a lot of new economic theory," said
Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Banc of America Securities Merrill Lynch research.
Hans Olsen, chief investment officer at J.P. Morgan's private wealth management unit, said investors
shouldn't cling to expectations that the dollar and gold will fall back into old habits. "There is not some
immutable axiomatic inverse relationship" between the dollar and gold, Mr. Olsen said. "There are periods of
time where the market might assign a linkage, and there are times when the different assets trade differently
for different reasons."
Some investors say the reason the old inverse relationship isn't working is because gold is no longer simply
an anti-dollar bet, but a wager against currencies more generally. In other words, gold isn't just a hedge
against a weaker dollar, but a form of protection against the temptation for any government to devalue its
currency.
"The gold price is up in any currency, really," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS
Greenwich Capital. "What that's telling you is that we have perceived problems lying ahead for paper
currencies."
In particular, investors are worried that government stimulus will eventually lead to rampant inflation. Not
only are benchmark interest rates in several markets near zero, but policymakers in the U.S., U.K., Japan,
and Switzerland are increasingly embracing unconventional methods to pump money into their moribund
economies.
Recently, gold and the dollar have pulled back together, partly because the stock market has recovered as
investors tiptoe into riskier assets. Tentative signs that the global economy is bottoming and the banking
system is stabilizing have encouraged investors to move out of gold and the dollar and into other currencies
and assets like oil.

--- Page 211 ---

After breaking through $1,000 an ounce, gold on Friday closed at $929.80, down from $942.10 a week
earlier. The dollar was at $1.2915 against the euro, from $1.2639.
Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch is forecasting the dollar will continue to find demand, and even strengthen
against the euro, as investors use the currency as a safe haven. The analysts predict the currency will be at
$1.18 against the euro by the end of the year.
"I find it very hard to believe that the dollar is on its way down right now because the data out of other
countries is worse," Mr. Bernstein said.
At the same time, the firm's commodity analysts are estimating gold will remain strong, averaging $1,000 an
ounce in 2009 and $1,050 in 2010. Longer term, the analysts sees gold rising as high as $1,500 an ounce
over a three-year period.
Gold this year has been buoyed by exchange-traded funds, which snapped up bullion as they attracted
waves of new investors. Retail buyers ratcheted up purchases of coins, and institutions began taking physical
delivery of the metal from exchanges.
Prices for the precious metal in other currencies are rising to all-time highs -- a factor both of a rising gold
price and a higher dollar. Last month, the price of gold in euros, British pounds, Canadian dollars, and South
African rand all touched records. In dollar terms, it remained just shy of its 2008 record.
The combination of a strengthening dollar and rising gold prices has created some ripples in the
marketplace, said Philip Newman, research director for GFMS, a London precious-metals firm.
Turkey, for instance, is normally one of the world's top consumers of gold, he said, but recently there has
been a tremendous increase in the supply of recycled gold out of the country. The reason: the dollar stormed
to an all-time high against the Turkish lira, driving Turkish prices for the precious metal to their own record
and providing an incentive to sell.
"If you're a non-U.S. investor, and your currency going to continue to depreciate," Mr. Bernstein said, "you
want to head for assets that are denominated in a currency that is appreciating."

Window Into Microsoft's Monopoly Money
A monopoly is a license to print money -- until it isn't.
That reversal hasn't yet come to Microsoft, whose 90%-plus share of the personal-computer software market
has made it a cash machine. The stock, though, is acting like the day of reckoning isn't far off. In the past 12
months, Microsoft stock is down 42%, comfortably underperforming the 20% to 25% or so declines at other
blue-chip tech names such as Apple, IBM and Oracle.
Microsoft shares are trading around 9.5 times consensus fiscal 2009 earnings, a little below IBM -- at about
10 -- and well under the others.
That may present an opportunity for investors near term. Microsoft still generates plentiful free cash flow --
$15 billion this year, estimates Credit Suisse -- and had net cash of nearly $19 billion at Dec. 31. So even
though earnings are expected to dip this year, the dividend, which offers a 3% yield, is safe. That can't be
said for many other companies.
What's more, the stock may get a boost in coming months ahead of the release of Microsoft's latest operating
system, Windows 7.
The reality that Microsoft's operating-system monopoly is gradually slipping away will, of course, continue to
weigh on the stock. But it is easy to overstate the immediacy of competitive threats facing the company.
Yes, Microsoft has lost market share, including to Apple, but only by a percentage point or so. Google's free
word-processing and spreadsheet software may one day be a viable alternative to Microsoft Office -- but it
isn't now. Smartphones will eventually erode demand for laptops, hurting Microsoft whose Windows Mobile
had only 12.4% market share in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Gartner, well behind Blackberry
maker Research In Motion and only a little ahead of Apple whose share is growing quickly. Again, the move
toward mobile could take years to play out.
A more-serious threat may be the expected move among businesses to use shared computer services run in
a "cloud," paying for the service rather than for PC software. Microsoft wants to be a major player in cloud
computing. It has the deep pockets necessary to invest in the data centers required, as do rivals including
Google and IBM. But IDC projects cloud will account for only 9% of business software and infrastructure
spending by 2012.
The experience of other industries undergoing structural changes -- such as broadcast TV's loss of market
share to cable networks -- is that the secular changes take a long time to seriously undermine the business
model.
Admittedly, to protect its market share in the meantime, Microsoft likely will have to cut prices, hurting
operating margins, which now reach 70% in some products. Already it gets only half its usual price for
Windows on increasingly popular low-cost laptops called netbooks. That will hurt profitability.
Microsoft has plenty of ways to cut costs, however, including trimming investment in some areas. Microsoft's
online business lost about $1 billion in the first half of fiscal 2009, despite massive investment in recent years
to build a presence in the search market dominated by Google.
This isn't to say Microsoft should hunker down and be run for cash. Microsoft has successfully built a server
business in recent years. But new business successes have to be huge to make a meaningful contribution to
a company generating $20 billion-plus of annual operating profit.
It needs to pick its investment spots carefully for its $9.5 billion in annual research-and-development
spending. And be willing to change tack when businesses, such as search, fail to gain traction.

This sort of retreat isn't likely to happen under the current management, which is likely to keep swinging for
the fences. A more-disciplined approach to costs and investment likely won't happen without some outside
pressure, such as from a dissident shareholder. With Bill Gates's stake gradually declining -- it is down to
8.5% -- that day will come.

Time for Bewkes to Make It America Offline
Time Warner's hiring of Tim Armstrong to run AOL is, to misquote another Armstrong, a small step for AOL
but a giant leap for Time Warner.
Whether or not the former Google executive can turn around the AOL business, his hiring clearly sets up AOL
to be spun off. That is a step Time Warner must take, having wasted years trying to fix or find a buyer for
AOL.
Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes shouldn't dawdle in making the formal decision on a spinoff. Now that the
Time Warner Cable spinoff is almost done, he has achieved tangible progress toward streamlining Time
Warner into a more-defined entertainment business. A quick AOL spinoff would free up Mr. Bewkes to deal
with the Time Inc. magazine business.
Adding to the pressure is this year's expected deterioration in AOL's performance. Pali Research has
projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to fall 36% this year to about $1
billion, and another 30% next year.
Unloading AOL also could trigger consolidation. Anyone interested in buying AOL would no longer have to
deal with Time Warner's price expectations, still influenced by the disastrous history of the AOL-TW merger.
Those who could sniff around once AOL is free include Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. IAC is cashed up,
with $1.8 billion in cash and investments at Dec. 31. AOL would enhance IAC's position online, for instance
doubling IAC's search market share to 8%, nearly in line with Microsoft's, based on comScore's February
rankings.
Time to send AOL into orbit, Mr. Bewkes.

The Dangers of Swiss Magnetism
With so much conventional wisdom about savvy investing up in smoke, investors are rushing to safe havens.
Gold is one. Switzerland is another. The Swiss franc was up 10% against the euro over six months, before
the Swiss central bank intervened Thursday to weaken the currency.
The intervention came because a strong franc is posing a huge problem for the Swiss National Bank. It is
increasing the risk of deflation and squeezing Switzerland's export-sensitive economy, which is expected to
shrink by about 3% this year.
The U.K.'s heavy exposure to troubled banks helped trigger a slump in the pound. Ironically, Switzerland took
such swift action to counter reputational damage to its banks that it may have compounded the currency
problem.
As investors worry about what more needs to be done to shore up U.S. and U.K. banks, UBS and Credit
Suisse are now among the world's best capitalized banks thanks to strict new capital-adequacy rules.
Given the size of Switzerland, even if foreign investors choose to park only a small percentage of what's left
of their wealth in Swiss francs, it puts significant upward pressure on the currency. Meanwhile, Swiss
investors themselves might help explain why the Swiss franc has proved so strong.
Benedikt Germanier, an economist at UBS, points out that in 2007, the latest full year for which data is
available, Swiss investments abroad amounted to 714 billion Swiss francs ($603 billion), equivalent to nearly
140% of Switzerland's GDP.
As global economic prospects have worsened and financial markets remain in shock, some of that wealth
overseas has likely found its way back to Switzerland.
So SNB faces an uphill battle to curb the Swiss franc's appreciation. For once the central bank may just wish
that the franc was pegged to its neighbors' currencies rather than being at the mercy of global capital flows --
over which it has little control as a small, open economy.

Calling the bottom? Obama adviser Larry Summers said Friday that the Dow -- adjusted for consumer price
inflation -- is where it was during Lyndon Johnson's presidency.
"Although there could be many ways to question this calculation, that the market would be at essentially the
same real level as it was in 1966 when there were no PCs, no Internet, no flexible manufacturing, no software
industry and when the work force was half and net capital stock was a third of what it is today, may be
regarded by some as the sale of the century." Also, there weren't pools of toxic mortgages that had just blown
a hole in the banking system.

Crude Jumps 11%, to $47.03

Crude Jumps 11%, to $47.03

NEW YORK -- Oil prices leapt 11%, as the market fretted over a coming meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled up $4.70, to $47.03 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
Crude futures have zigzagged, with daily price changes of more than 5% occurring 19 times this year on the
Nymex. For all the volatility, prices have swirled near $40 for months.
Thursday's jump followed a dive the day before, and came as a Sunday meeting of OPEC neared. The cartel
announced cuts totaling 4.2 million barrels a day last year, efforts that helped a falling market bottom out.
With prices still below the comfort level of many members, it is unclear whether OPEC will cut more.
"It's been fairly dicey to predict OPEC meetings," said Antoine Halff, deputy head of research at brokerage
Newedge USA in New York. "They cultivate the art of surprise."
Crude has plunged more than $100 a barrel from its high last July, squeezing oil exporters' budgets. OPEC
member Venezuela will urge a cut to prop up prices, said Angel Rodriguez, chief of the Venezuelan
Parliament's energy commission, according to Agence France-Presse.
Libya's oil minister said the oil market is oversupplied and will go along if OPEC agrees to an output cut. In
Russia, the largest producer outside OPEC, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said the country supports cuts
to oil deliveries, "and Russia will participate in this work," according to Russian news agencies.
Other OPEC members are thought to favor no change to current quotas.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of the Nymex rallied after the Swiss central bank signaled an effort to
stem its currency's appreciation. The Swiss franc is normally viewed as a haven, thus investors turned to
gold, another haven, as the franc fell. Bargain hunting and short covering also contributed to the move.
Nearby March gold added $13.30, or 1.5%, to $923.70 a troy ounce.
NATURAL GAS: Futures rose on U.S. government data showing a larger-than-expected withdrawal of natural
gas from storage last week. Natural gas for April delivery on the Nymex settled up 15.5 cents, or 4%, to
$3.995 a million British thermal units.
CORN: Climbing stocks, solid export sales and technical strength sent CBOT corn futures surging, traders
said. March corn ended up 20.75 cents to $3.7675 a bushel, May corn ended up 20.75 cents to $3.8525 and
July corn ended up 21 cents to $3.9550.

Gold Sheds 2.4% to $895.60 an Ounce --- Metal Hits Lowest Price Since Feb. 10 on Surging Stocks,
China Concerns

NEW YORK -- Gold prices fell below $900 an ounce as surging stocks leached safe-haven attraction from
the metal and deflationary concerns weighed.
Investors unwound the buying that had helped send the metal above $1,000 last month. Stock-market fears
eased following optimistic comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and news that
Citigroup was profitable in the first two months of the year.
"With the equity market doing better, gold is losing a lot of that panic buying that was holding it up," said
Sterling Smith, vice president with FuturesOne.
The price of the thinly traded gold futures contract for March delivery shed $22.10, or 2.4%, to settle at
$895.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell to as far as
$892.10 in electronic trading shortly after the floor session closed. That marked the front-month gold
contract's softest point since Feb. 10.
The most-active April contract also fell $22.10 to $895.90 an ounce. The contract touched $891.10 in
electronic trading.
Investors often buy gold in times of financial uncertainty because they think the metal will hold its value better
than other assets. Thus gold can come under pressure as money moves back into those other assets, such
as stocks, when fears ease. Recently, gold has been pressured as funds sold the metal to meet margin calls
related to declining stock markets.
Charles Nedoss, senior account manager and metals analyst with Peak Trading Group, said money on
Tuesday also was coming out of other so-called safe haven instruments, notably the U.S. dollar and
Treasurys.
Gold already was under pressure from news of a decline in China's consumer prices in February, said Jim
Steel, senior vice president and metals analyst with HSBC. That news further darkened the nation's economic
outlook and reinforced worries of deflationary pressures. That weighed on gold because the metal is often
bought as a hedge against rising prices.
"Disinflation trending towards deflation is alive and well in China," Jon Nadler, analyst with Kitco Bullion
Dealers, wrote in a research note.
The investment-led pressure on gold comes against a backdrop of weak jewelry sales in India -- the world's
largest buyer of the metal for jewelry -- and as flows into the world's largest physically backed gold
exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares have stalled.
"Recent hopes for $1,000 gold were dashed in the last two days by stop-loss sellers, fund liquidations and
margin selling, both from option holder hedgers and mining companies afraid of missing the market," said
George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices retreated as general concerns about weak oil demand resurfaced. Oil had surged 35% in
the past month on early signs that supplies were tightening, but the prospect of further declines in
consumption threatens to throw the market off kilter again. Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery fell $1.36,
or 2.9%, to $45.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

CORN: Sharply higher stocks and an improved outlook for ethanol helped Chicago Board of Trade corn
futures advance strongly. The market has gotten a boost this week from comments by U.S. Department of
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who on Monday expressed his support for increasing the ethanol-blending
levels in gasoline to 12% to 13%. March corn rose 9.50 cents to $3.6675 a bushel.

All three major indexes closed at their highs Tuesday in the biggest one-day rally seen since late 2008.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 379.44 points, or 5.8%, to 6926.49, in a move that added $134.5
billion to its overall market capitalization. All 30 Dow components rose. General Electric climbed 20%,
undoing some of the damage from a rout that has pushed shares down by more than 45% this year. Alcoa
and General Motors rose 14% and 13%, respectively. Both have declined more than 40% in 2009, even after
Tuesday's surge.
The S&P 500-stock index surged 43.07 points, or 6.4%, to end at 719.60 as its financial sector gained nearly
15%. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 89.64 points, or 7.1%, to 1358.28. Tech stocks snapped back
from a sharp selloff on Monday that pushed stock indexes to fresh bear-market lows. Google climbed 6% to
reclaim the $300 level.
"This kind of broad-based move is encouraging, but the question becomes: Will it be sustained? At this point,
it certainly feels that way," said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities.
Still, similar rallies in September, October and November turned out to be fleeting.
Stocks rose sharply at the open Tuesday and never wavered. The rally flushed investors out of safe-haven
bets on Treasurys, gold and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year note pushed near 3% while the two-year
note's yield topped 1%. Gold futures slid below $900 an ounce.

Big Investors Bet on Gold Over Currencies
Big Investors Bet on Gold Over Currencies

Large investors, including some who anticipated troubles for the housing and financial sectors, have been
buying gold, concerned that moves by governments to shovel money at problem areas could cripple leading
currencies.
Firms such as Eton Park Capital Management LP, Greenlight Capital Inc., Hayman Advisors LP and Paulson
&Co. have been ramping up gold exposure in recent months, according to investors in the funds. Blue Ridge
Capital Holdings LLC and Highfields Capital Management LP also have been recent buyers, according to
public filings about their year-end holdings. Those two firms couldn't be reached for comment Sunday.
Some of these funds have become among the largest holders of gold exchange-traded funds, such as the
SPDR Gold Shares ETF, while also buying gold futures contracts, swaps and even physical bars of the
yellow metal.
For years, gold fans often were fast-moving traders and so-called gold bugs, a crowd of bears
ever-convinced that the underpinnings of global economies and markets were set to crumble and inflation
about to soar. Gold has disappointed some investors because it hasn't been a home-run investment despite
recent financial ills.
The recent purchases of gold by the hedge-fund investors, some of whom have top records, suggest they
are coming to share deep worries about the health of global economies and how continuing problems are
being addressed.
Kyle Bass, who runs Hayman, a firm that earned millions of dollars betting against risky subprime home
mortgages, is now buying gold. "People will look to 'old fashioned' stores of value -- those which represented
money long before green pieces of paper backed a promise existed," Mr. Bass recently told investors.
"Indeed, investors have already begun moving into precious metals. We expect this will continue."
Since 1971, the dollar has been backed not by gold but by faith in the U.S. government. Though they worry
about the dollar, some of the investors buying gold are even more concerned about European currencies.
John Paulson's eponymous firm, which reaped $15 billion in 2007 betting against subprime mortgages and
added more profits last year, is beefing up its gold holdings. Last week, it told clients it will offer its investors
a new share class denominated in gold.
Gold is the largest investment in the portfolio of Greenlight, led by David Einhorn, who has bought
exchange-traded funds holding gold as well as gold futures contracts, according to a person familiar to the
matter.
Some of those buying gold predict nations will default on their debt, as they spend money to help stabilize
their economies. The spending could lead to a burst of inflation, at least eventually, some say, which could
help gold rise in price. But even deflation, or falling prices, could bolster gold, which usually does a good job
storing value, the bulls say. Others simply see gold as a better alternative to crumbling stocks, corporate
bonds and Treasurys with super-slim yields.
Still, gold isn't an investment that produces any kind of cash flow, like a share of a company or a
fixed-income investment, and consumer demand for gold-related products is down amid the global economic
downturn. Those factors have long reduced its attractiveness to many investors.
Though gold has been a robust performer of late, hitting $1,000 an ounce recently before closing at $942 an
ounce on Friday, it has been stuck in a range of $700 to $1,000 an ounce for much of the past few years.
That raises questions about the potential for upside, especially if stocks regain their footing. If gold can
preserve value at a time when most other investments drop, that in itself could reward bulls, of course.

World News: China's Soaring Bank Lending Stands Out in Global Downturn

BEIJING -- Optimistic official comments from China's annual legislative meeting are highlighting the country's
differences with major Western economies caught in the worsening financial crisis.
China's economy hasn't turned the corner into recovery -- Housing sales, construction and manufacturing
continue to contract, and the worst is almost certainly still to come for exporters hammered by downturns in
U.S. and European demand, with February trade figures next week expected to show a sharp decline.
But while financial systems sag in many countries, Chinese banks -- state-run, stodgy and opaque though
they may be -- continue to pump money through the economy. Along with flush household savings and solid
corporate balance sheets, that is sparing China from the liquidity crunch and credit collapse savaging other
nations.
"The effect of this financial crisis on China is different than its effect on Western developed countries," Zhang
Ping, the head of China's economic planning agency, said at a news conference on Friday. "For us the
biggest impact has been on the real economy, while in the West there has been a major impact on the
financial system."
"It's just one crisis, not two" for China, said Ben Simpfendorfer, an economist for Royal Bank of Scotland.
Because they don't have to restructure their financial system, he said, Chinese authorities can focus on
re-accelerating economic growth with measures like the 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) investment plan the
government announced in November.
The most important complement to the government's spending has been the jump in bank lending since
November. In January alone, banks made 1.6 trillion yuan in new loans -- more than they did in the entire first
quarter of 2008. February data to be disclosed in the next few days are expected to show another strong rise
in loans.
"The size of total lending in January was beyond our expectations," central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan
said Friday at a news conference. Mr. Zhou said the increase is welcome if it keeps confidence from
declining, and that any problems from the surge could be dealt with later.
While some experts question whether China's wave of lending is sustainable, it's the kind of problem other
countries would like to have right now. "It's probably the only country in the world with a big expansion in
private credit," Ronald McKinnon, professor of international economics at Stanford University, said in a recent
talk in Beijing. With the European Central Bank and Bank of England slashing interest rates to record lows
this week, the contrast is even more stark.
The availability of credit has helped ease China's slowdown, officials say. Indicators of manufacturing are
falling less sharply than they were in November and December. "There are already some signs of
stabilization and recovery. This shows that our policies are starting to take effect," said Mr. Zhou, the central
bank governor.
Such optimism is, to some degree, intended for public consumption. The administration of Premier Wen
Jiabao has made reassuring consumers and businesses a central part of its response to the crisis. This week
Mr. Wen declared that China can achieve its traditional target of 8% economic growth for 2009. Though many
private forecasters say that is unlikely, it was a public display of the confidence that Mr. Wen frequently says
is "more important than gold or money."
However, domestic and global investors were disappointed that Mr. Wen didn't announce additional stimulus
measures this week, and the reaction drove markets down.
Why didn't China ramp up its stimulus? In practical terms, it would be almost impossible for the government to
announce new investment projects now, as it hasn't finished allocating the original funds announced in

November. Revising the stimulus could also have undermined the government's careful optimism about
current prospects -- and left officials with fewer resources to deal with what many expect to be a protracted
global slump.
"We believe the government is unwilling to use up all its ammunition at the current stage of the downturn,"
said Lan Xue, China strategist for Citigroup.
Chinese officials say their response to the crisis so far has been effective, but they are leaving their options
open. "Of course, we cannot lower our guard now, and we cannot say that we can completely avoid the
impact of the financial crisis," said Mr. Zhang, the economic planner. Officials are monitoring changes in the
economy and will shift policies as needed, he said.

Stocks resumed their relentless slide after a one-day respite, falling to new bear-market lows.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 281.40 points, or 4.1%, to 6594.44, its lowest close since April 15,
1997, and down more than 53% from its closing high on Oct. 9, 2007. It has fallen nearly 25% so far this year.
Financials again took center stage as Citigroup fell 9.7% to close at $1.02, after hitting an all-time low of 97
cents during the day. Just a year ago its shares changed hands at around $22 and two years ago it was a
$50 stock and the biggest bank in the U.S. by market value.
General Motors fell below $2 for the first time, closing at $1.86, after its auditor cast doubt on the company's
ability to continue operating.
Although the troubles facing GM and Citi were well known, the symbolic significance of their latest declines
helped fuel the broad selloff, said Matthew Kaufler, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. "Seeing both
icons of American business being brought to their knees is just feeding the fear," he said.
Stocks have lost $11 trillion in market value since the October 2007 peak, based on the Dow Jones Wilshire
5000 index, which includes nearly every U.S.-listed stock. Losses since the start of 2009 are $2.6 trillion.
Nearly half of all stocks in the index are now trading at less than $5, and 37% are under $3.
"Until . . . credit gets flowing again, it's hard to see how we have any real recovery," said David P. Prokupek,
chief executive of Denver investment-management firm Geronimo Partners. He said his firm has lowered the
weighting of stocks in its client portfolios to about 5% of assets, down from a high of about 15% last year.
The S&P 500-stock index fell 4.3% to 682.55, its lowest close since September 1996. Insurers posted big
declines as Hartford Financial Group fell 20%.
Treasury prices rose and yields fell as investors sought havens. Gold, which had fallen recently from
near-record highs, rose 2.3% to $927 a troy ounce.
The stock declines began in the morning after an expected Chinese economic-stimulus package, which drove
global markets higher Wednesday, failed to materialize. The slide picked up speed in the late afternoon as
mutual-fund managers sold shares to meet redemptions. Investors also worried about the government's
February employment report, due Friday morning, which is expected to show further job losses.
Moody's Investors Service said it may downgrade the credit rating of Wells Fargo and lowered its outlook on
J.P. Morgan Chase to negative. Wells Fargo shares fell 16%, while J.P. Morgan dropped 14%
Recent moves in Citi's stock have been magnified by traders trying to profit through an arbitrage that involved
selling the bank's common stock while buying its preferred shares.
European markets also fell as investors brushed aside the latest government efforts to stabilize global
markets. The Bank of England and European Central Bank both cut interest rates.
Stock investors are playing catch-up to bonds, which had reflected dire conditions months ago, said Basil
Williams, CEO of hedge-fund manager Concordia Advisors. Although bonds other than super-safe U.S.
Treasurys struggled Thursday as stocks fell, in recent weeks there has been demand for investment-grade
corporate and municipal debt.

Gold Halts Eight-Day Skid, Rising to $927 on Haven Buying

Gold futures settled higher on flight-to-safety buying, snapping an eight-day losing streak as stocks slumped.
Analysts said bargain hunting also was evident after the metal's recent slide.
Nearby March gold rose $21, or 2.3%, to $927 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange, while most-active April climbed $21.10 to $927.80.
"The weakness in equities is creating some safe-haven buying," said Tom Pawlicki, analyst with MF Global.
"It looks like a flight to quality, with some of the banks selling off hard on the Dow," said Andrew Montano,
director of precious metals at Scotia Mocatta.
Fund buying added to volume at the close, with banking woes and interest-rate cuts by the Bank of England
and European Central Bank supporting gold, said George Gero, vice president at RBC Capital Markets
Global Futures. He also described the U.S. fourth-quarter productivity report as inflationary.
The physical side of the market also appears to be playing a role in gold's rise, Mr. Pawlicki said.
"There has been an end to some of the scrap selling [in India]," Mr. Pawlicki said.
Morgan Stanley analysts issued a report Thursday lifting the firm's 2009 average price forecast for gold to
$1,000 an ounce from $900.
"We still expect market conditions to favor gold prices, given uncertainty in both global and financial markets
as well as our optimism that central banks will do whatever it takes to bolster liquidity," said analyst Hussein
Allidina.
In other commodity markets:
SUGAR: Futures fell 3.3% on speculative fund sales sparked by a stronger U.S. dollar and lower crude-oil
prices and amid fears the macroeconomic picture may worsen and pressure demand. May sugar on ICE
Futures U.S. fell 0.43 cent to settle at 12.83 cents a pound.
NATURAL GAS: Futures fell following the release of U.S. government data showing a surplus of gas in
