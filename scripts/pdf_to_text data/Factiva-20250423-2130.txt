Quick Recoveries
May Not Be
What You Think
As "corrections" go, this one was quick.
A week ago, many skeptics thought they saw the commodities bubble bursting. Now, despite small declines
Friday, oil is less than $5 shy of its $110.33-a-barrel exchange record, gold again has been bouncing closer
to $1,000 an ounce, and corn has returned to a lofty $5.61 a bushel.
To be fair, a mini-bubble of sorts did burst. The onslaught of investors who this year parked money in hard
assets as a hedge against rising inflation -- and who couldn't find good parking spots in stocks or bonds --
turned and ran from commodities. One trigger: March 19 the Federal Reserve issued a hawkish statement on
inflation, leaving some investors to think it might not let commodity prices keep soaring.
These newcomers had been among the troublemakers behind oil's puzzlingly quick march from $100 a barrel
to $110 amid an ailing economy. Economist Philip Verleger estimates $6 billion flooded into investments that
track commodity indexes following the Fed interest-rate cut of Jan. 22; he then identifies a drop around March
18.
Banks and exchanges have been raising margin requirements as futures markets grow more volatile.
Investors have had to set aside more cash just to keep up their bets, and that has forced some to unwind big
positions. Mr. Verleger points out that the 1979-80 silver bubble "was broken by the raising of margin
requirements."
But many others who allocated a small chunk of their assets to commodities much earlier than that -- ranging
from pension funds to little guys -- aren't budging. From the look of prices, recent lows of $100 for oil and
$918 for gold are now called "buying opportunities."
The report Monday from the Agriculture Department on how much land U.S. farmers will devote to certain
crops could renew the buying frenzy in grain futures. Already, corn stocks at the end of this year's harvest are
projected to hit record lows, and some analysts see less corn planted this season than last year.
But if there isn't a bubble in commodities yet, quick recoveries like the past week's could easily lead to one.
Retrenchments that don't last can contribute to bubble mentalities. Crude fell $10 over just six trading days
but swiftly reversed course to rise 4.7% from the March 24 low.
As in the frothy tech-stock market of 1999 and 2000, investors might be getting used to pullbacks that are
mere resting points before the gallop resumes. Energy analyst Stephen Schork ranted Wednesday that oil's
rise proves "once again that markets can remain illogical far longer than you or we can remain solvent."
Citigroup analyst Tobias Levkovich warned a day earlier of the danger of ignoring historical trends. "It is
critical to realize that commodity prices do go down during recessions and have done so for almost 40 years."
All the talk of a commodity "super cycle" wrongly implies, he says, that this time the rules don't apply.
But Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, a staunch commodity bull, says those that view this retrenchment,
whatever is left of it, as a buying opportunity will have the last laugh.

Undertow of Worry Again Tugs on Stocks --- After an Initial Climb, Shares End Lower; DJIA Falls 1.2%

The stock market tried but failed to shake off its worries Friday, tying a grim ribbon on a mostly downbeat
week.
Stocks climbed to start the day, but anxiety lurked beneath the cheer and eventually resurfaced, dragging the
Dow Jones Industrial Average down 86.06 points to 12216.40, its third straight decline. It lost 1.2% for the
week and the blue-chip average is down 14% from its October record and 7.9% for the year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.54 to 1315.22. It dropped 1.1% on the week and is down 10%
this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 19.65 to 2261.18, off 15% for the year.
For each bit of good news Friday, there was bad news to offset it.
Citigroup upgraded investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings, whose shares have fallen sharply amid talk
of liquidity troubles. But options traders were still betting heavily against Lehman and another broker that has
suffered during the credit crunch, Merrill Lynch. Lehman ended the day down 2.2% at $37.87, while Merrill
lost 4.7% to 39.93, pulling other financials lower. Citi and American Express were the worst performers in the
Dow industrials, falling 4.4% to 20.83 and 3.8% to 43.15, respectively.
Also weighing on financials was the fate of mortgage lender Fremont General. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. ordered Fremont, once a major subprime lender, to raise capital or sell its banking unit. Fremont shares
fell 15% to 52 cents. Government-backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dropped 7% to
26.02 and 6% to 25.45, respectively.
A Commerce Department report on personal income and spending wasn't entirely abysmal -- high praise for
an economic report these days -- raising hopes the economy might yet avoid a deep recession.
But J.C. Penney cut its earnings forecast, citing poor sales. That aggravated concerns about the strength of
consumer spending, and the retailer's shares fell 7.5% to 37.48. The Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. retailing-stocks
index fell 1.9%.
"There was a real tug of war between a couple of positives and a couple of negatives," said Todd Clark,
director of trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco.
So it has gone for months. Time and again, stocks have been pummeled by worries about the health of the
credit markets and economy, only to be snatched higher, typically by some dramatic Federal Reserve action.
Stocks rallied in the week ended March 20, after a Fed rate cut and creative liquidity measures. But they
retreated for the past week, albeit on fairly light trading volume.
OIL: Oil futures fell $1.96, or 1.8%, to $105.62 a barrel.
GOLD: Gold prices fell $18.20, or 2%, to $930.60 a troy ounce.

Prudent Bear's Approach Delivers Payoff --- Tice's Pessimism Leads to Gains, But No Second Date
Fund Track

Sometimes, a grim view of the economy can cramp your style. During a recent first date, says David Tice,
manager of Prudent Bear Fund, he made the mistake of sharing his bleak investment outlook at dinner. No
second date followed. "You can almost feel the energy go from the room," Mr. Tice said about when he offers
his take on the economy.
But as an investor, Mr. Tice is on a roll. By selling short and maintaining a relentlessly downbeat look at the
market, his $1.2 billion mutual fund is up more than 15% in the past year, almost 20 percentage points ahead
of the market. His bad-news-bear approach is just getting started: He argues the U.S. is entering a multiyear
bear cycle.
His views haven't always been winners. During its first three years, Prudent Bear lost almost 19% on average
annually from 1996 to 1999, according to Morningstar, when the bull market was steamrolling bears like him.
"We never said we would always make money," said Mr. Tice, who adds that his fund isn't intended to be
anyone's core holding.
Question: What needs to happen to get us back on track?
Mr. Tice: We're going to have to take some pain. We'll have to reconfigure our economy less towards
consumption and more towards manufacturing more products that can be sold abroad. Our standard of living
is going to have to come down.
Question: What's the worst-case scenario?
Mr. Tice: The Federal Reserve's policy to always bail out the economy was a big mistake. The dollar is a
huge problem because foreigners see us continuing to debase our currency. It's going to be a massive
recession if not a depression. The fixes don't really fix anything; they just make it worse.
Question: Since 1982, we've been in a long-term bull market, which means your bearish view hasn't panned
out. What do you say to skeptics?
Mr. Tice: We essentially missed the extent to which policy makers would go to keep the economy going and
how much credit would grow, especially to the lower-end borrower.
Question: What do you make of the comparisons between the U.S. and Japan's lost decade in the 1990s?
Mr. Tice: In 1989, the Nikkei was at 35000. Now it is [below] 13000. They had a humongous real-estate
bubble there, but they were different in that they loaned money to themselves. We have depended on foreign
creditors, so I think it could be worse.
Question: So what are you shorting these days?
Mr. Tice: We're widely diversified. We don't take more than a 1.2% position in any stock and are investing in
larger companies to dampen volatility. We're playing in consumer-discretionary names, banks/brokerage
firms and technology names. Last year, tech was represented as a safe-haven area away from carnage of
financials, but there is a huge consumer sensitivity to lot of technology.
Question: Are we talking about the Apple and Googles of the world?
Mr. Tice: I don't want to talk names, but chip companies are also dependent on consumer demand.
Question: What about retailers?

--- Page 9 ---
Page 9 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Mr. Tice: We moved away from some of these names in January because so many hedge funds were short
those stocks, and it got crowded. We're also not in housing but more housing suppliers.
Question: What stocks do you own?
Mr. Tice: We are still long precious-metals stocks -- gold, silver, uranium. We like several Canadian
companies -- like Silverstone Resources -- with market caps between $50 million to $5 billion. We're trying to
identify companies that are still under-recognized and have operating leverage. We are also invested in
copper company Capstone Mining, which we have seen a 10-fold profit in but still like.
Question: As a contrarian, does it trouble you that everyone likes gold, too?
Mr. Tice: A little bit. We have less invested than two years ago. Over five years, gold has risen a lot.
However, we still think it has a long way to run. The Dow Jones [Industrial Average]-to-gold price ratio has
ranged from 43 to 3, and right now it's near 15. I think it will go to single digits.
Question: Where do you see other bubbles building?
Mr. Tice: China, emerging markets, the spread between the two-year bond and 10-year, the art market.
Question: What would have to happen for you to become bullish on the U.S. market/economy?
Mr. Tice: I want to get bullish again, but I think these excesses and imbalances are going to take a while to
play out. This is probably a once-in-a-100-year cycle. We will have to have a 40%-plus decline in the U.S.
stock market, plus a massive adjustment to the U.S. economy, away from consumption towards saving and
investment, resulting in massive closures of various retailers and a dramatically reduced current-account
deficit.

Dow Slips a Bit as Investors Show Faith After Dismal News
Tuesday's Markets
Dow Slips a Bit as Investors Show Faith After Dismal News

Bleak news about home prices and consumer confidence did little to hurt the stock market, a sign that recent
gains could have staying power, or at least that investors have grown a bit less skittish.
After rising more than 400 points in two days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average spent much of Tuesday
slightly in the red, finishing down 16.04 points, or 0.1%, at 12532.60. Other indexes rose a bit.
The Dow is now down 5.5% this year and 12% below its record close in October.
Analysts said financial markets are continuing to wrestle with the implications of recent moves by the Fed
aimed at establishing a framework for more stable credit trading and a rebound in economic growth, including
interest-rate cuts and its backing of the acquisition of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan Chase. by
"The Fed still has a lot of work to do," said Kathy Lien, chief strategist at DailyFX.com, a New York
currency-research firm. She expects payroll data due out April 4 to further spook investors about the
prospects for a broader U.S. economic recovery.
The dollar fell and commodity prices jumped, reviving a trend many investors hoped was over.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.2%, or 3.11 points, to 1352.99. It was led by its
basic-materials sector, up 2.7% on the heels of the rally in raw materials. The S&P is down 7.9% this year
and off 14% from its record in October.
The technology-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.6%, or 14.30, to 2341.05, though it remains
down 12% in 2008.
David James, senior vice president of James Investment Research in Alpha, Ohio, said his firm has been
advising clients to bet more aggressively on stocks since shortly after the Fed's March 11 decision to accept
a wider range of credit securities -- including many distressed issues -- as collateral for its loans to financial
firms.
But Mr. James also believes the stock market's rally will be short-term, lasting perhaps two or three months
amid a bear market and anemic economic growth that could last several years. "With a credit problem like we
have now, it gets right to the heart of what drives businesses and consumer activity," he said. "Once you've
entered a problem like this, it can take a while to solve."
Economic news Tuesday offered investors little to cheer about. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index
showed home prices in 10 U.S. cities slid 11.4% in January, the steepest drop since the index began in 1987.
The Conference Board issued a worse-than-expected reading of consumer confidence for March.
Raw materials, down sharply last week, benefited from a return of speculative buyers. A weakening dollar
also helped commodities, which are priced globally in dollars.
The broad-based Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index gained 1.9%, or 3.785 points, to finish at 203.301. Gold
and oil futures rose, snapping a three-day losing streak.

Stocks Tarnished By 'Lost Decade' --- U.S. Shares in Longest Funk Since 1970s; Credit Crunch Could Prolong Weakness
Stocks Tarnished By 'Lost Decade' --- U.S. Shares in Longest Funk Since 1970s; Credit Crunch Could
Prolong Weakness

Over the past 200 years, the stock market's steady upward march occasionally has been disrupted for long
stretches, most recently during the Great Depression and the inflation-plagued 1970s. The current market
turmoil suggests that we may be in another lost decade.
The stock market is trading right where it was nine years ago. Stocks, long touted as the best investment for
the long term, have been one of the worst investments over the nine-year period, trounced even by lowly
Treasury bonds.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the basis for about half of the $1 trillion invested in U.S. index funds,
finished at 1352.99 on Tuesday, below the 1362.80 it hit in April 1999. When dividends and inflation are
factored into returns, the S&P 500 has risen an average of just 1.3% a year over the past 10 years, well
below the historical norm, according to Morningstar Inc. For the past nine years, it has fallen 0.37% a year,
and for the past eight, it is off 1.4% a year. In light of the current wobbly market, some economists and market
analysts worry that the era of disappointing returns may not be over.
Until last fall, many investors had viewed the bursting of the tech-stock bubble as a nasty but short-term
setback. The market had resumed its upward march, reaching new highs in October. Then the credit crisis
began weighing on stocks, as did the possibility of a recession. By March 10, the S&P 500 was down 18.6%
from its Oct. 9 record close, nearing the 20% decline that signals a bear market. It has rebounded since then
amid the Federal Reserve's efforts to stabilize the financial system, but it remains 13.3% below its October
record.
Conventional stock-market wisdom holds that if investors buy a broad range of stocks and hold them, they
will do better than they would in other investments. But that rule hasn't held up for stocks bought in the late
1990s or 2000.
Over the past nine years, the S&P 500 is the worst-performing of nine different investment vehicles tracked
by Morningstar, including commodities, real-estate investment trusts, gold and foreign stocks. Big U.S.
stocks were outrun even by Treasury bonds, which historically perform much less well than stocks. Adjusted
for inflation, Treasurys are up 4.7% a year over the past nine years, and up 5.8% a year since the March
2000 stock peak. An index of commodities has shown about twice the annual gains of bonds, as have
real-estate investment trusts.
Stocks also underperformed other investments during the 1930s and the 1970s. During both of those periods,
stocks would rally strongly, only to fade. It took well over a decade in each case for stocks to move lastingly
upward.
So far, the current decade hasn't featured the high inflation of the 1970s or the high unemployment of the
1930s. That makes some analysts and economists hopeful that the stock troubles won't be as bad or last as
long as they did back then, despite the housing crisis and the breakdown in parts of the mortgage and lending
businesses. Many of them hope that the Federal Reserve will do a better job of righting the ship than it did in
those prior decades.
Finance professor Jeremy Siegel at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School has written about stock
behavior back into the 19th century. During the past decade, he points out, the worst years were from 2000
through 2002, when stocks fell sharply. Although the S&P 500 has been inconsistent since then -- rising
strongly in 2003, then registering single-digit gains in 2004, 2005 and 2007 -- he considers the bad times
largely past. Other optimists agree.

But Yale economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the market trouble in his 2000 book "Irrational Exuberance,"
warns that the market still hasn't shaken off its excesses. He and some other analysts think the latest volatility
is a symptom of more trouble to come.
"I have to say that this isn't a great time to be in the stock market," says Prof. Shiller. "The housing crisis that
we are going through is going to put a damper on the economy that is longer than a recession. I don't see the
stock troubles ending as quickly as many people are imagining."
Historically, stocks rise about two years out of every three, for an average gain of 7% a year when controlled
for inflation, according to Prof. Siegel. Stocks have shown gains for almost every 10-year period since 1925
-- 98.6% of the time, according to Ned Davis Research.
But when stock investing becomes a mania, as it did in the 1920s, the 1960s and the 1990s, it leads to
prolonged periods of subpar performance, according to financial historian Richard Sylla of New York
University's Stern School of Business.
Prof. Sylla has examined stock booms and busts back to 1800. He found periods of exceptional strength in
the late 1810s and early 1820s, the 1840s, the 1860s and the early 1900s. Those periods were followed by
lengthy weakness in the 1830s, the 1850s, the 1870s and before 1920. In a 2001 paper, he forecast a
10-year period of stock weakness.
"When you have extraordinary returns, as we did from 1982 through 1999, then usually the next 10 years
aren't very good," says Prof. Sylla. His research suggests that exceptional booms steal gains from the future.
When the booms end, returns become subpar, so that average returns over the longer term fall back to the
7% norm. Economists call this "reversion to the mean," the idea that exceptional performance can't last
forever.
Bullish investors believed that the bad days were over late in 2002, when stocks rebounded following the
technology-stock wreck, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the collapse of Enron Corp.
The S&P 500 rose 26% in 2003, amid hopes for a quick victory in Iraq. In 2004, the S&P 500 rose only 9%. It
was up 3% in 2005, 14% in 2006 and 3.5% in 2007. The index is down 7.9% so far this year. Those numbers
are not adjusted for inflation, which would lower annual returns by a few percentage points.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fewer technology stocks than the S&P 500 and suffered less in
the bear market from 2000 to 2002, has held up better, but not a lot better. It has risen less than 1% a year
since January 2000.
Prof. Sylla expects to see stocks turn more lastingly upward some time in the next two years. The market's
direction will depend partly on the individual investor. The 1990s stock bubble and the bear market that
followed came at a time when more individuals were managing their own retirement savings through 401(k)
accounts, individual retirement accounts and the like.
Individual investors helped create bubbles in the markets for technology stocks and for real estate. In recent
years, investors have been putting far less money into U.S. stocks than they did during the stock-investing
boom. In 2000, at the height of that boom, Americans added $260 billion to U.S.-stock mutual funds,
according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. Last year, investors took more money out of
those funds than they put in -- a net outflow of $46.4 billion.
America's shift toward self-managed retirement could soften some of the stock-market volatility. People
appear to be much less likely to move money around in retirement accounts than in other investment
accounts, according to economist John Ameriks at mutual-fund company Vanguard Group.
Many 401(k) participants leave their allocations alone for long periods of time, says Mr. Ameriks. If they set
up their accounts to send money into stocks each month, those accounts tend to keep doing so through bull
and bear markets alike. That may provide some support to stocks.
Some investment advisers say passive contributions like that actually make some sense. People whose
retirement accounts have bought stocks each month, year in and year out, haven't done nearly as badly as
those who bought in the late 1990s and stopped buying, Prof. Sylla says. While the S&P 500 is down since
1999, it is up since mid-2001, meaning that most stock purchased since then by retirement accounts shows a
gain.
A big problem for the market right now is what analysts call stock fundamentals. Strong corporate-profit gains
and low inflation have supported stocks since 2002, but they are becoming harder to sustain.

--- Page 13 ---

In a typical year, Prof. Sylla says, corporate profits run at about 5% or 6% of total economic output, after tax.
In 2006, that number was 9%, a record. Historically, this number tends to revert to the mean, suggesting that
profits now could weaken. "Profits may fall to 3% or 4%" of economic output, Prof. Sylla says.
Spending by ordinary people could have an effect on those profits. Consumer borrowing and spending kept
the economy afloat after the stock bubble popped in 2000. Emboldened by high home values, people
borrowed at levels rarely seen, pushing down the national savings rate to zero.
That's what worries Prof. Shiller. After studying the housing market, he sees home values continuing to
weaken for years. He expects consumers to borrow and spend less, and to rebuild their savings.
A consumer pullback would hold back economic growth and corporate profits, putting a damper on U.S. stock
gains and giving investors an incentive to continue putting money into commodities or stocks in Brazil,
Russia, India and China. Baby boomers concerned about retirement income could look for safer investments
with guaranteed returns, such as Treasury bonds and bond-like products offered by mutual-fund companies.
"We have to accept that this is no longer a nation of 4% real economic growth. This is a mature nation that no
longer has a strong manufacturing base," says Steve Leuthold, chairman of Leuthold Weeden Research in
Minneapolis. He believes that another bull market is on the horizon, perhaps following some additional stock
declines. But that future bull market, he contends, could be followed by another bear market that could bring
stocks back close to where they are today.
Before another lengthy bull run can begin, stocks need to overcome two problems: the hangover from the
high prices of the late 1990s, and the continuing effects of the exceptionally low interest rates instituted by
the Federal Reserve in 2001 and again today. Those low interest rates helped push corporate profits higher,
but also fueled borrowing excesses that led to today's economic problems.
To some analysts, stock prices still look inflated. Prof. Shiller calculates that the S&P 500 traded in the late
1990s at more than 40 times its component companies' profits -- far above the historical norm of 16. (To
avoid distortions, he uses average profits over a 10-year period.) Today, the S&P 500 still trades at more than
20 times profits -- still far above average.
"The S&P 500 never got back down to its long-term trend line" after the 1990s, says Jeremy Grantham of
Boston money-management firm Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. Mr. Grantham, who has long warned
of a prolonged period of subpar stock performance, says exceptionally low interest rates temporarily
propped up the indexes.
There are reasons to hope that things won't be as ugly this time as they were either in the 1970s or in the
1990s in Japan, which went into a prolonged slump after bubbles in its housing and stock markets.
For one thing, although inflation has been running above 4% this year, it remains well below the double-digit
rates of the 1970s. That's made it easier for the Fed to stimulate the economy without worrying about
sparking runaway inflation.
One big question is how much worse investor confidence will get. The bearish Mr. Grantham expects
investors to become gloomier, but not as pessimistic as they were during past bad stretches.
"I think the global economy will stay, on balance, not so bad," he says. "There is no reason for people to
become as pessimistic as they did even in Japan, and certainly not as pessimistic as in the Depression."

Financial stocks soared in Europe, Asia and the Americas on hopes the worst of the credit crunch has
passed, giving many indexes their best day in weeks.
In Europe, where most markets reopened Tuesday following a four-day Easter break, the pan-European Dow
Jones Stoxx 600 index jumped 3.3% to 306.63, its highest close since March 13.
Markets in Hong Kong and Mumbai notched gains of more than 6%.
The gains came after a big advance in U.S. stocks Monday, on the back of strong existing-home sales and
J.P. Morgan Chase's increased offer for Bear Stearns. U.S. stocks also jumped Thursday before the market
closed for Good Friday.
Some analysts and investors were skeptical about the staying power of the rallies. The steepest one-month
decline in U.S. consumer confidence in a decade, announced during Tuesday's European trading day, fed
that thinking.
The day's gain made only a small dent in the losses this year of 16% for the Stoxx 600. Most Asian indexes
also are in the red for the year.
"We can have relief rallies for a while and then sell off," said Kostas Iordanidis, co-chief investment officer at
Olympia Capital Management in Paris, which runs funds of hedge funds. "Clearly, we have gone a long way,
but the credit crisis that started in June of last year is not yet over."
One of the day's largest gainers was United Kingdom lender HBOS, which soared 15%. The stock had been
battered for much of the past two weeks, in part on rumors, denied by the bank, that it had sought emergency
funds from the Bank of England. Royal Bank of Scotland Group rose 9.3%. In Zurich, UBS, the European
bank that has disclosed the largest losses related to subprime mortgages, jumped 8.2%.
Technology was the best-performing sector in Europe with a gain of 6.4%. Nokia, which accounts for more
than 40% of the region's technology index, leapt 8.2% in Helsinki after Chief Financial Officer Rick Simonson
told Bloomberg Television that the company hadn't felt much of an impact from the U.S. downturn.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 rose 3.5% to 5689.10, its largest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 24. Taylor
Wimpey, a U.K. home builder with operations in the U.S., surged 12%. British Energy rose 6.4% on a
weekend report that Centrica, which operates in North America, the U.K. and Western Europe, is weighing a
GBP 10 billion bid ($19.85 billion) for the nuclear-power generator. Centrica rose 1.7%.
In FRANKFURT, the German DAX 30 rose 3.2% to 6524.71. Adidas rose 6.1% on a deal that allows Brazil's
Vulcabras to distribute Reebok apparel and footwear in Brazil and Paraguay. The venture should lead
Reebok sales to increase, at constant currencies, at a mid-to-high single-digit-percentage rate. Adidas
previously forecast Reebok's top-line growth in a low-to-mid single-digit range.
Alitalia skyrocketed 33% in Milan on hopes for an improved offer from Air France-KLM.Air France-KLM ended
up 0.2% in Paris.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index, which also reopened after a four-day Easter weekend, jumped 6.4%,
its largest one-day gain since Jan. 25, to 22464.52. Financials fronted the recovery. HSBC Holdings gained
5.2%, while Bank of East Asia surged 9.4%.

In MUMBAI, the India market's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was Asia's second-best performer of the day,
surging 6.1% to 16217.49. It has climbed 9.5% in the past four sessions. Real-estate stocks, among the worst
hit in recent weeks, posted strong gains. DLF, an Indian developer, surged 14%.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 2.1%, its fourth gain in the past five sessions, to
12745.22. Exporters jumped after the U.S. dollar climbed above 100 yen. Honda Motor rose 4.1% and Canon
climbed 3.5%.
It was a similar story in the Americas as several markets rallied.
In MEXICO CITY, stocks closed higher for a second straight session Tuesday, as investors poured money
into large-cap names such as mobile operator America Movil SA. The benchmark IPC index of the 35
most-traded shares rose 1.2%, or 346.92 points, to close at 29981.08, after gaining 1.9% Monday as U.S.
stocks rallied.
Retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico closed 1.5% higher.
In TORONTO, miners including Kinross Gold and Barrick Gold led stocks sharply higher after a rebound in
gold and base metals prices. Meanwhile, strong retail sales data and a recovery in banking stocks led to
broad-based gains. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 302.50 points, or 2.3%, to 13322.22. "The whole
commodity sector got pulled down pretty hard last week, and we're retracing some of that," said Ian
Nakamoto, strategist at Macdougall, Macdougall & MacTier.
In SAO PAULO, Brazilian stocks rose following the recovery of international commodities prices. The
benchmark Bovespa index ended 2.4% higher at 61234.06. The market was led higher by oil giant Petroleo
Brasileiro, or Petrobras, and miner Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, or Vale, and was ably supported by the
steelmakers, taking the Bovespa to its third consecutive high. Petrobras shares rose 5.3% on rising oil prices.
Similarly, Vale rose 2.8% on jumping metals prices.

Grain and Oilseed Post Gains on Weakness in Dollar
Commodities Report
Grain and Oilseed Post Gains on Weakness in Dollar
By Andrew Johnson Jr.

Weakness in the dollar served as the catalyst for a rise in Chicago Board of Trade grain and oilseed futures.
Wheat rose nearly 5%, while soybeans and corn posted gains of nearly 4% on the day.
CBOT May wheat closed up 47.5 cents to $10.6750 a bushel. May soybeans settled up the
exchange-imposed 50-cent limit at $13.07, and May corn finished up the 20-cent limit at $5.4475 a bushel.
Weakness in the U.S. dollar and climbing gold prices generated bullish momentum in the grain complex, said
Dale Durchholz, analyst with Agrivisor in Bloomington, Ill.
Grain markets slumped last week as jitters about the economy weakened financial markets and sparked fears
that grains could slip into a downtrend.
Now, "the economic situation on the outside looks a little more stable and more money is flowing into the
market," said Shawn McCambridge, analyst for Prudential Bache in Chicago.
"It's kind of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde kind of attitude," the analyst said. Tuesday's up move "is just kind of a
reverse mirror image of what was going on last week."
Soybean prices were also buoyed by a lingering farmers' strike in Argentina, as traders wonder if the situation
will cause global soybean buyers to shift purchases from Argentina to the U.S. or other suppliers.
Analysts also expect soybean futures to maintain price strength ahead of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
prospective plantings report, scheduled to be released Monday. The report is the first official government
estimate of what farmers intend to plant for the 2008 crop year.
Acreage also played a role in corn's gains. Corn-planted area in 2008 is expected to be smaller than the 93.6
million acres seeded in 2007, as farmers switch to other crops like wheat and soybeans, even though
demand for corn isn't expected to decline.
While wheat futures posted the largest percentage gain on the day, the gains were largely in response to the
weaker U.S. currency and the limit up moves in corn and soybeans. Wheat futures are expected to take
further direction from the prospective-plantings report as well as a quarterly grain-stocks report that is also
scheduled to be released Monday.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures crept higher to close above $101 a barrel in a market torn between economic worries
and a weaker dollar. Light, sweet crude for May delivery settled up 36 cents, or 0.4%, at $101.22 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, snapping a three-day losing streak.
Crude is now off 8.3% from its Nymex record close of $110.33 hit on March 13 but is still up 61% from 52
weeks ago. Buying was underpinned by the dollar's weakening against rival currencies, which has historically
drawn speculators seeking a hedge against the currency's slide and inflation.
A propane leak at BP PLC's Texas City, Texas, refinery helped stoke supply jitters in the market, also
keeping buying sentiment high.
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of the Nymex rose as investors viewed gold as a good hedge against
the decline in the U.S. dollar. March gold gained $16.30 to $934.60 a troy ounce.

Dow Jumps 187.32 as Clouds Lift a Bit --- Investors Take Cheer In Home-Sales Data, Higher Offer for Bear
Monday's Markets
Dow Jumps 187.32 as Clouds Lift a Bit --- Investors Take Cheer In Home-Sales Data, Higher Offer for
Bear

Surprisingly strong home-sales data and J.P. Morgan Chase's decision to sharply increase its bid for Bear
Stearns spurred an across-the-board rally in stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 187.32 points, or 1.5%, at 12548.64, its second straight gain
and the highest close this month. The blue-chip average is down 5.4% this year and is 11% below its record
close in October.
The Dow was helped by solid gains in all its financial components, led by Citigroup, up 3.4%, and American
Express, up 3.1%. Only three of 30 Dow components posted declines.
There was welcome news on both fronts of the crisis that has bedeviled financial markets since last summer
-- falling home prices and big credit losses for financial companies that packaged and resold
mortgage-related debt.
In the session's most closely watched piece of corporate news, J.P. Morgan Chase agreed to quintuple its
offer for Bear Stearns to $10 a share in an effort to pacify angry Bear shareholders who were maneuvering to
block the transaction.
Bear Stearns shares jumped 89% to $11.25. J.P. Morgan, a Dow component, rose 1.3%.
The National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales rose 2.9% in February, compared with
January, the first increase in seven months. The reading beat analysts' expectations for another decline and
signaled that some buyers are taking advantage of sharply falling home prices.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.5%, or 20.37 points, to 1349.88 but is still down 8.1% this year
and 14% off its October record. All the broad measure's sectors rose, led by the basic-materials group, up
3.6%.
Investing pros said the rally in large part reflected investors' growing confidence that the Federal Reserve and
other market overseers are acting effectively to address the credit crisis. That perception began to grow last
week when the central bank revised its lending requirements in the credit markets, expanding the list of
securities it would accept as collateral. It also cut its key interest-rate target by three-quarters of a point and
backed J.P. Morgan's acquisition of Bear Stearns.'s acquisition of
"The bad news is not done for the financials, but we've moved through the crisis period," said strategist Joe
Williams of Commerce Trust in Kansas City, Mo. "There is a sense of relief" that a chain reaction seems less
likely.
One sign of investors' newfound willingness to dive into riskier areas of the market: The technology-focused
Nasdaq Composite Index was up 3%, or 68.64 points, to 2326.75.
Though still down 19% from its October high, it is out of what is traditionally considered a bear-market -- a
20% decline from a high. The small-stock Russell 2000 gained 2.9%, or 19.86 points, to 701.28 and is down
8.5% on the year.
Treasury prices sold off sharply as investors grew more confident about stocks. The benchmark 10-year note
fell 1 20/32, or $16.25 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the yield down to 3.522%. The 30-year bond
dropped 2 17/32 to yield 4.313%.

Some investing pros sounded a cautious note. "Who knows if there's going to be another Bear Stearns out
there?" said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "When this whole process started and people
asked who's got the most exposure, Bear's name wasn't the only one on the list."
The dollar strengthened against the euro and yen. But most commodity prices, which are priced globally in
dollar terms, also managed to rise as speculators tentatively returned to raw materials following a big selloff
last week. The broad Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index, which slid 8.6% last week, ended 1.1% higher, up
2.182 points at 199.516.
But oil and gold continued their declines from last week. Crude-oil futures fell 98 cents to $100.86 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.Gold fell $1.30 a troy ounce to $918.30.

Surprise -- Citi, GM Drive Dow's Ascent --- Toll Brothers Climbs On Housing Data; Tiffany Shines, Too
Abreast of the Market

Several 2008 stock-market trends flipped on their heads Monday as General Motors and Citigroup led the
Dow Jones Industrial Average higher, while home builders such as Toll Brothers and retailers such as Tiffany
outshone mining stocks and Treasury securities. Technology stocks on the Nasdaq, abruptly dropped in the
recent flight from financial risk, felt the pickup most acutely.
After failed stock-market recoveries in November, January, February and early March, some traders were
skeptical that the gains would stick. "Right now, we are viewing this bounce as nothing more than a
bear-market bounce," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
Some banks and lenders rallied after J.P. Morgan Chase raised its bid for Bear Stearns, yielding to pressure
from irate Bear shareholders. Shares of Citigroup, one of the largest gainers on the Dow, added 77 cents, or
3.4%, to $23.27.
Yet the financial rally tapered off as the closing bell approached, and some of Bear Stearns's closest peers
finished in the red: Lehman Brothers Holdings fell 2.01, or 4.1%, to 46.64.
As for GM, the auto maker rose 88 cents, or 4.5% to 20.38.
Home builders surged after the first glimmer of hope for the sector in a long time, as sales of used homes
rose 2.9% in February from January and inventories contracted somewhat. That hardly dispelled all economic
worries: Sales fell 24% from February 2007. Toll Brothers rose 1.08, or 4.7%, to 24.18.
Another consumer-discretionary group, retailers, received a lift from jeweler Tiffany, whose shares rose 4.05,
or 10%, to 42.65 after it forecast "robust growth" from overseas, despite doubts about its domestic prospects.
Shares of two radio broadcasters rallied after the Department of Justice cleared the $4.2 billion merger of
Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, ending speculation about the antitrust status of such a
combination. Shares of Sirius (Nasdaq) added 25 cents, or 8.6%, to 3.15; XM Satellite (Nasdaq) rose 1.85, or
15%, to 13.79.
Defensive stocks, which fare better than most in nervous markets because their businesses are less
susceptible to recessions and financial crises, declined alongside safe-haven investments such as Treasury
securities and gold. For example, health-care stock Johnson & Johnson was the weakest performer on the
Dow, falling 49 cents to 64.89.
Similarly, a further slip in the price of gold -- long a hiding place for investors -- weighed on mining issues
such as AngloGold Ashanti, which fell 14 cents to 31.49; and Newmont Mining, declined back 51 cents, or
1.1%, to 45.46.
Sherwin-Williams fell 95 cents, or 1.8%, to 52.87 after the maker of paints cut its profit projection for the first
quarter and for 2008, hurt by a slowdown in sales even as costs increase in a weak construction market.
Electronic Arts (Nasdaq) rose 1.23, or 2.5%, to 49.69 after the videogame developer said its chief financial
officer was quitting as its fiscal year draws to a close and it attempts to take over rival Take-Two Interactive
Software.
Cigna rose 1.58, or 4%, to 41.41 after UBS raised its rating on the health-care plan provider's shares to buy,
saying it was primed to reap the benefits of a recent acquisition
One stock that has seen feast and famine in 2008 is Monsanto, which rose 7.13, or 7.3%, to 104.26 -- still shy
of its January peak of 127.25. UBS raised its long-term rating on the distributor of seeds and other agricultural
products to "buy" from "neutral," saying a recent correction in share price looked to be complete.

News Corp. reportedly bid on Tribune's Newsday newspaper, according to Crain's New York's Web site.
Shares of News Corp. rose 48 cents, or 2.6%, to 19.12. The company owns Dow Jones, publisher of The

Moving The Market / Currency Trading -- Forex View: Fed's Restraint May Lead Dollar To Continue Rise
Moving The Market / Currency Trading -- Forex View: Fed's Restraint May Lead Dollar To Continue
Rise

Slumping commodity prices and a Federal Reserve that has begun to exhibit restraint in cutting interest
rates may allow the dollar's modest rally to continue this week.
Investors believe the dollar may have finally found a champion in the Fed after the U.S. central bank
reduced interest rates less than expected last week and noted that it is more worried than before about
inflation. That could pave the way to an eventual end to the rate-reduction cycle, which could attract
investors back into the greenback.
"We've seen a moderate comeback in the dollar," said John Shin, currency strategist at Lehman Brothers in
New York. "The Fed's decision is, to some extent, consistent with the idea that policy makers don't want to
see a dollar in free fall."
Commodity prices might be the key to the dollar's performance this week. Oil prices fell at their sharpest rate
in years last week, and if investors believe a longer-term trend toward price declines is afoot, the dollar
stands to gain. Hedge funds that used dollars to buy commodities may continue to unwind those bets, parking
their funds back in greenbacks.
With all of this as a backdrop, analysts are forecasting the euro could trade between $1.530-$1.560 this
week, while the dollar is likely to drift between 98 Japanese yen and 101 yen.
The euro was at $1.5439 late Friday in light global trading, compared with $1.5417 the day earlier, while the
dollar was at 99.42 yen, up from 99.19 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.9825, compared with $1.9838, and the
dollar was at 1.0089 Swiss francs, from 1.0115 francs.
Some of the dollar's swing higher last week came as a result of its appealing status as the comeback kid of
currencies, as the recent sharp declines have left the greenback oversold against many rivals. That support
could erode fast if U.S. housing data due this week come in as poor as expected and remind investors why
the U.S. economy and the dollar are in the dumps, or if gold and oil prices rebound.
"We interpret the dollar rally of the past days as a natural phase of consolidation after such a sharp decline,"
said Bilal Hafeez, currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. "We keep a core long-euro-versus-dollar position,
looking for new highs [in the euro] once we pass this phase of consolidation."
Still, some analysts think the dollar may have seen the last of its nose dives that caused some to suggest
major central banks would have to intervene in markets to halt the U.S. currency's slide. Also, investors are
hoping the credit crunch could be easing thanks to the Fed's massive liquidity-pumping actions and
government plans to help struggling home owners.
If such sentiment continues this week, look for currency investors to refocus on economics, both in the U.S.
and globally. This could be good for the dollar if more indicators suggest the euro-zone economy is starting to
feel the effects of the downswing in the U.S.
Against the yen, the dollar may face a more-difficult time this week, as the Japanese currency has also
gained broadly on the back of lower commodity prices. Short-term investors who had bet big on
commodity-linked currencies such as Australian and Canadian dollars did so with borrowed yen to take
advantage of the low interest rates offered in Japan. As those investors sell the Australian and Canadian
dollars, some are buying yen to pay back those loans from Japan, providing support to the Japanese
currency.

Commodity Break
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Commodity Break

Amid last week's market tumult, there was one glimmer of good news: The first break in weeks in the
commodity price bubble that had been building since the Federal Reserve signaled that price stability was
well down its list of priorities.
On Tuesday, two members of the Fed's Open Market Committee formally dissented from the decision to cut
the fed funds rate by another 75 basis points, to 2.25%. Markets had expected a cut of 100 points. Even that
new and mild Fed caution about inflation seems to have taken the edge off speculators who had been
betting that the dollar would continue falling to new lows amid U.S. malign neglect.
In the wake of that dissent, gold took a deep dive, falling to $910 an ounce from above $1,000. Oil also
headed down -- to below $102 a barrel from nearly $110 -- and other commodities fell from speculative highs.
All of this is good news for consumers, who have watched this commodity boom lift energy and fuel prices
and reduce their discretionary spending power.
This is further evidence that the commodity price boom is rooted in the Fed's weak dollar policy, and not in a
change in "relative prices" due to rising global demand. Commodity prices have soared since September in
particular, even as the world economy has slowed down. The "global demand" argument has become a Wall
Street-Washington excuse for easier money in the mistaken belief that the Fed can inflate away U.S. credit
problems. Instead, the commodity boom has hurt consumer and business confidence precisely when they are
most needed. The Fed still has a long way to go to restore its credibility, but last week was at least a start.

Bug Control: Gold Skeptics Use ETNs --- Notes Offer Ability To Go Short, Take Leveraged Position

Bug Control: Gold Skeptics Use ETNs --- Notes Offer Ability To Go Short, Take Leveraged Position

New exchange-traded notes that allow investors to bet against gold were shining last week.
An ETN that shorts gold by doubling down on futures prices rose 21% in just the three days that ended
ahead of the Good Friday shutdown for U.S. markets, as the metal and other commodities continued to
plunge following the Federal Reserve's rate cut and inflation warnings.
Until last week, gold had been soaring, to more than $1,000 a troy ounce. And, in fact, gold bulls insist this
downturn is only a pause in a longer-term rally.
That may be so, but you wouldn't have known it by last week's action, when DB Gold Double Short ETN,
which is issued by Deutsche Bank, gained roughly 7% on each of the three days preceding Friday -- amid a
broad selloff in hard assets such as precious metals, oil and wheat. Commodity prices corrected hard after a
prolonged rally driven by Fed interest-rate cuts, a weak dollar and recession fears heightened by the credit
crisis.
Gold prices saw their steepest decline in nearly two years Wednesday after the Fed said uncertainty about
the outlook for inflation has increased. A rising dollar also makes dollar-denominated commodities such as
gold more expensive for foreign investors.
There is speculation that leveraged investors are selling profitable commodities positions to raise cash to
offset losses elsewhere.
"A strategy designed to use base commodities to protect investors from inflation, at a time when economic
growth is slowing and underlying demand for commodities is weakening, is unsustainable," said Thorsten
Fischer, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Designed to provide leveraged, inverse exposure to already volatile gold prices, the ETN's ticker symbol,
DZZ, could be appropriate given its potential to make investors dizzy with big gains or losses in short periods.
In late February, Deutsche Bank listed a trio of gold ETNs, which are similar to exchange-traded funds, or
ETFs, on the NYSE Arca electronic arm. The other two are DB Gold Double Long ETN (symbol: DGP) and
DB Gold Short ETN (DGZ). All three have annual expenses of 0.75%.
One of the latest trends in ETFs and ETNs is products that give individual investors the ability to take
leveraged or short positions in various sectors.
For example, DB Gold Double Short ETN provides twice the monthly inverse, or opposite, return of gold
futures. In addition to the return from gold's price movement, investors earn a yield based on an index of
three-month U.S. Treasury bills.
Therefore, if gold prices fell 6% during a month, the ETN would aim to deliver a 12% positive return, not
including the Treasury yield, although the actual results may not line up exactly, as leverage changes over
time based on the movement of gold prices.
Conversely, if gold rose, the ETN investors would stand to lose money because it provides short exposure to
the metal.
DB Gold Short ETN provides unleveraged short exposure. So if gold slipped 6% for the month, the ETN is
programmed to gain 6%. The other product, DB Gold Double Long ETN, gives straight leveraged exposure to
gold prices.

"Gold has had quite a run-up, so the correction was not entirely unexpected," said Kevin Rich, managing
director in Deutsche Bank's global-markets investment-products group.
A massive ETF that holds actual gold bars, StreetTracks Gold Shares (GLD), also saw heavy trading last
week. It lost ground as the short-side ETNs gained, but it remains up more than 9% for the year to date and
has doubled over a three-year period.
The Deutsche Bankgold ETNs are different from leveraged and inverse ETFs from ProShares and Rydex
Investments that seek to give double or the opposite of the daily return of an index, minus expenses. In other
words, the leverage is reset on a daily basis to produce the desired effect.
In contrast, Deutsche Bank's gold ETNs perform this task on a monthly basis, in an effort to leverage or short
the metal's longer-term performance. During the month, the leverage levels on DB Gold Double Long ETN
and DB Gold Double Short ETN can move away from 2-to-1, especially in volatile markets. Still, they should
deliver close to the desired leverage on a monthly basis.
ProShares is reportedly readying ETFs that would give leveraged and inverse exposure to commodity
indexes including gold, so the Deutsche Bank ETNs could see competition.

Politics & Economics: Paulson Takes Lead Amid Crisis
Politics & Economics: Paulson Takes Lead Amid Crisis

WASHINGTON -- Last Sunday, during a frantic weekend in which the housing crisis pushed a venerable Wall
Street firm toward bankruptcy, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson decided it was time to twist arms at
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
On a conference call with the chief executives of both lenders, Mr. Paulson urged Fannie and Freddie --
private companies with implicit government backing -- to raise $10 billion each in new capital and boost the
number of mortgages they could finance. His message: The foreclosure crisis and the credit crunch it
spawned are now too serious for half-steps and hesitation. Freddie Mac's Richard Syron and Fannie Mae's
Daniel Mudd, neither of whom had been eager to go fund-raising just a few days before, agreed to seek
billions in new capital to help revive the shocked mortgage market.
"We've got an opportunity to . . . do a good thing for the markets," Mr. Paulson told the housing executives,
according to a person on the call.
This past week, the federal government suddenly became a big factor in the search for a solution to the
housing crisis after months of incremental measures. The Fannie/Freddie move was one of a series from the
Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. authorities to stabilize markets and reassure homeowners, as
many as two million of whom are expected to enter foreclosure this year.
There is no telling whether this will prove a pivotal point in the economic and financial downturn that began
last summer. But a week that began with disaster did settle down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
3.4% through Thursday to 12361.32 -- its best performance since the week ending Feb. 1. Oil, copper, gold
and silver prices fell, while the dollar climbed 1.6% to $1.5417 per euro. U.S. markets were closed Friday.
"Everyone was expecting this to be a terrible week, and instead it was one of the better weeks we've had in a
long time," said Jason Furman, a Brookings Institution senior fellow. But, he added: "We're very far from out
of the woods."
The government's actions this past week marked a noted uptick in federal activism. They also solidified Mr.
Paulson's position within the administration as the crisis's point man. Previously, he had drawn criticism from
Democrats and some in the financial industry for an approach centering on voluntary moves by the mortgage
industry to modify loan terms for troubled borrowers.
Friday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) called on Alphonso Jackson,
secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to resign. He questioned Mr. Jackson's leadership and the
agency's operations during the housing crisis. Mr. Jackson, through a spokeswoman, said he plans to remain
in office, and the White House expressed its support.
How much further the administration will go is unclear. The White House has publicly remained adamant that
it won't support a bailout for the housing market. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney
Frank (D., Mass.) is pushing a bill that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars in federal guarantees to
let hard-hit homeowners refinance their mortgages.
"You've got a tension here," White House economic adviser Edward Lazear said in an interview Friday. "You
want to make sure that you keep people in their homes to the extent possible, but you don't want to reward
speculators. You don't want to reward unscrupulous lenders and so forth."
Treasury officials contacted Mr. Frank's office this week to discuss his bill, a sign Democrats took as evidence
the administration is willing to compromise.
Three days after the conference call with Mr. Paulson, Messrs. Mudd and Syron stood beside their top
regulator -- Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight Director James Lockhart -- and announced they

--- Page 28 ---
Page 28 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
would raise "significant" capital. Mr. Lockhart, in turn, agreed to remove some restrictions on the companies,
permitting them to buy an additional $200 billion in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
Treasury officials also privately encouraged the Federal Housing Finance Board to allow the nation's 12
Federal Home Loan Banks to buy as much as $160 billion in mortgage-backed securities, creating even more
liquidity for markets. The finance board, a little-known government agency, is expected to approve the
measure Monday.
Together, the moves by Ofheo and the finance board will let government-chartered firms buy as much as
$360 billion in mortgage-related assets, a potentially huge injection of liquidity into a dry market.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve stepped into uncharted territory. Two weeks ago, the Fed began
devising a way to support the mortgage-backed securities market, which was left in limbo by defaults by
homeowners. Tuesday, the Fed unveiled a plan to lend as much as $200 billion of its own much-sought
Treasurys to bond dealers for up to 28 days. In return, it would take temporary ownership of their
now-shunned mortgage-backed securities.
It proved only a short-term help. Lenders and counterparties already had begun refusing to do business with
Bear Stearns Cos. Friday morning, the Fed made a 28-day loan to the firm via J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,
using its emergency power to lend to nonbanks from its discount window for the first time since the Great
Depression. But lender skittishness grew that day, threatening to pull in more investment banks.
The Fed followed Tuesday with a 0.75 percentage point cut in short-term rates to 2.25%, bringing total
trimming since September to three percentage points, its most rapid pace of easing in decades.
"The Fed has gained some important 'street cred' over the past two weeks with its latest salvo of rate cuts
and credit facilities designed to stave off financial and economic Armageddon," Scott Anderson, Wells Fargo
senior economist, wrote to clients Friday.

Gold's Drop Doesn't Faze Bulls --- Inflation Fears Suggest Commodities Correction Will Be Short-Lived

Gold's Drop Doesn't Faze Bulls --- Inflation Fears Suggest Commodities Correction Will Be

A roughly 10% drop in gold prices from record highs in the past week doesn't portend a longer and deeper
correction for the metal, because inflation concerns are likely to continue, and sellers will probably return as
buyers into what has been a bullish market.
"We've needed a healthy correction in commodities," says Bill O'Neill, a principal with Logic Advisors. "This
may be a signal that the corrections may not be lasting in nature. This does not signal the end of
commodities."
The nearby-month March gold contract has fallen nearly 10% from an all-time front-month high of $1,014.60
an ounce on Monday to Thursday's low of $917.70. It settled down $25.10 to $919.60 on the Comex division
of the New York Mercantile Exchange, ahead of Good Friday, when markets were closed.
Over that same period, most-active April gold futures have fallen more than 12% from a contract high of
$1,033.90 on Monday to Thursday's low of $904.70. April gold declined $25.30 to settle at $920.
"Longer term, I still think gold is pretty much a decent bet," said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist with
BMO Capital Markets.
The perception that inflation may increase on "very accommodating monetary policy" from the Federal
Reserve will likely keep commodities in an upward direction, Mr. Melek said.
"I do expect the markets to come back," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path
Trading. "A lot of it just depends on the outlook for the economy and interest rates. We don't have a clear
picture of things right now."
Hedge-fund-led selling on Wednesday and Thursday was responsible for much of the losses, as the dollar
rose after a smaller-than-expected interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday afternoon.
March gold on Wednesday saw the biggest drop in dollar terms in more than 28 years -- since Jan. 22, 1980,
when it fell $143.50. Wednesday's was the largest percentage decline since July 13, 2006.
However, the past week's slide in gold prices doesn't represent a major turnaround for the market, said Scott
Meyers, senior trading analyst with Pioneer Futures.
"I think the trend is still up," he said. "You're seeing a reaction [to the less-than-expected rate cut]."
There are temporary price drivers, for example, such as the funds taking some profits as the end of the first
quarter approaches, Mr. Meyers said.
Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist with Lind-Waldock, described himself as "still bullish" on gold. And
in many cases, those who exited from long gold positions are also bullish, he said.
"They've pulled the pin on their positions," he said. "They are holding off, waiting to get back in the market."
Many are waiting for the market to show signs of putting in a bottom before re-entering, and it is possible that
won't occur until the coming week, Mr. Pavilonis said.
Otherwise, inflation remains a concern in the U.S., and investors often buy gold as an inflation hedge, he
said.
"People are still paying more money at the grocery store, and they are paying more money at the pumps," Mr.
Pavilonis said. "As we still have inflation, you're still going to need a safe haven to put your equity."

While the Fed's concern about inflation has boosted the dollar and sent commodities lower, some portion of
that talk may simply be "rhetoric" meant to appease those who see the central bank as not doing enough to
curb rising consumer prices, said Michael Gross, broker and futures analyst with OptionSellers.com.
The week's action in gold isn't likely the beginning of a longer and deeper correction, he said.
"I think this is a knee-jerk reaction to the Fed's announcement," but longer term, the central bank will have to
continue cutting interest rates, which will likely further pressure the dollar and prove supportive for gold, Mr.
Gross said.
"This is the inevitable consolidation that you have to see when markets have run-ups like this," said Logic
Advisors' Mr. O'Neill. "It just came too far too fast."
Mr. O'Neill expressed concern there may be more "shoes to drop" amid continuing troubles in the credit
markets, which have led to safe-haven buying of gold lately, but he said he doesn't foresee the pullback as
the start of a longer-term correction.

Dollar Gains on the Yen In Light Global Trading

The dollar traded in tight ranges with little volume as U.S. stock and bond markets were closed for Good
Friday and no major U.S. economic data were released.
Most European markets were also closed, but in Asian trading Tokyo stocks climbed 1.8%, which fueled
some risk appetite in foreign-exchange markets and weighed on the low-yielding yen. The dollar and the euro
exited active trading slightly higher against the yen Friday.
The dollar barely moved against the euro, suggesting perhaps that the dollar's rally that began this past week
on the back of slumping commodity prices could extend into the coming week.
Still, analysts weren't convinced further dollar gains may be sustained for long given a stagnant U.S.
economy and low interest rates by the Federal Reserve that continue to weigh heavily on the greenback.
"We are not inclined to overinterpret this week's price action," said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency
strategy at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. "We suspect the dollar will reverse some of its gains in coming
weeks, and suspect a sustained rally in the dollar is some months away."
Friday afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.5439 from $1.5417 late Thursday, while the dollar was at
99.42 yen from 99.19 yen. The euro was 153.50 yen from 152.92 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.9825 from
$1.9838 late Thursday, and the dollar was at 1.0089 Swiss francs from 1.0115 francs.
With oil falling back near $100 a barrel this past week and gold down near $920 a troy ounce, many hedge
funds that used dollars to bet heavily on these commodities have shifted back into greenbacks as a safe
haven. That has helped give the dollar its lift during the past few days.
The drop in commodity prices has also fueled a selloff in currencies whose countries are major commodity
producers, such as the Canadian and Australian dollars.
Friday afternoon in New York, the Australian dollar was at $0.9018, near where it closed late Thursday and
well off its $0.9347 high for the week, reached Wednesday.
And the U.S. dollar stood at C$1.0239 Friday afternoon, much higher than its week low of C$0.9879.
Wells Fargo's Mr. Bennenbroek said the Canadian dollar's declines last week may be a sign of more
weakness to come.
"A reversal in oil prices has contributed to the Canadian currency's fall and, given the prospect of further
Canadian rate cuts, we do see the underlying trend for the Canadian dollar as down over a longer time
horizon," he said.
Brazil's currency, the real, also has weakened due to the lower commodity prices. But Brazilian economic
fundamentals remain relatively solid, direct investment inflows are firm and international reserves have been
built up substantially, so the real may see some bounce in the days ahead, Mr. Bennenbroek said.

Banking:
Chinese Lenders
Set to Detail
Subprime Bite
----
By Jason Leow
Bank of China Ltd. and the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., two of China's largest lenders and big
investors in U.S. subprime assets, are scheduled to make a long-awaited announcement when they report
earnings Tuesday: how much their subprime exposure has eaten into the banks' profits.
China's banks have generally been much less exposed to the global slowdown and to subprime woes. Bank
of China, which historically has invested overseas, may be the exception in a record year for China's banks.
Due to its larger subprime exposure, Bank of China likely will report far-lower profits than will ICBC. Bank of
China's 2007 profits are forecast to increase 25% at best from the previous year. That is worse than its peers,
which are forecasting profit increases of at least 50%.
That isn't really awful in the context of what is going on around the world for financial institutions, said
Charlene Chu, a senior director at Fitch Ratings China. "The problem is, 2007 happened to be a stellar year
for earnings growth for most other Chinese banks," she said.
Bank of China has disclosed the value of its subprime investments only up until September. Analysts think
those investments may have deteriorated and have lost more value in the fourth quarter, so they are waiting
to hear if the bank has written down or set aside additional impairment charges for that period. These
write-downs and provisions will reduce its profit.
By September, the bank still had almost $8 billion in subprime-linked assets. Analysts believe its net income
will increase anywhere from 1% to 25%, though last month Chairman Xiao Gang was quoted by state-run
Xinhua news agency as saying the bank will report a "visible increase" in its 2007 profit.
Subprime exposure won't be the only drag on profits. The bank has large foreign exchange-denominated
holdings that have lost value, so it likely will have to record less income from those sources, too.
ICBC's profit for 2007 is forecast to rise 63% from a year earlier. Analysts are less concerned about its
smaller subprime exposure. In its third-quarter report, ICBC said it held subprime-mortgage bonds of about
$1.2 billion.
Analysts are more worried about how Chinese banks will perform this year. China's banks earn a sizable
portion of income from interest and fees, and both increased last year. Increased lending to corporate clients
helped banks post record interest incomes. A booming domestic stock market lifted sales of wealth-related
products and fueled fee income. Chinese customers also moved their savings from longer-term deposits into
short-term demand accounts in order to get out cash for buying stocks. That helped banks pay out less
interest returns.
But prospects for 2008 are dimmer. Given China's record inflation rate, the central bank looks set to tighten
the reins on loan growth. That will damp banks' interest earnings. Banks' fee-based income also will drop
from less investment activity. A slowing U.S. economy will exacerbate banks' earnings if customers start to
default on their loans.

Eventually, the banks' nonperforming-loan ratios may rise, though these are lagging indicators that don't
show up until months after an economy turns down. By December, the combined nonperforming-loan ratio of
Bank of China, ICBC, China Construction Bank Corp., Bank of Communications Co. and the Agricultural
Bank of China had risen to 8.05%, from 7.83% three months earlier, driven largely by the Agricultural Bank.
Zimbabwe:
Mugabe's Maneuvering Dims Hopes for Fair Election
----
By Sarah Childress
Anxious to ensure his victory in next Saturday's polls, the government of Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has banned Western observers, intimidated the opposition and bribed starving rural dwellers with
food, international watchdog groups say.
All that has dimmed hope that despite international pressure and two strong opposition candidates, the
elections in Zimbabwe will be any fairer this time around than in previous years.
Still, the election will be the first time in Mr. Mugabe's 28-year rule that he will face a serious challenger from
within his own ranks. The president's former finance minister, Simba Makoni, is running against him, as is
longtime opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
Mr. Tsvangirai, a dedicated human-rights activist and trade unionist, has endured beatings and intimidation
for opposing the government in previous elections. But his party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has
never succeeded in defeating Mr. Mugabe.
A chemist trained in the U.K., Mr. Makoni was fired from the government cabinet after criticizing the
president's economic policy. When he announced his candidacy in February, some outside observers and
Zimbabweans in the diaspora had held out hope that he might at least be able to loosen Mr. Mugabe's iron
grip on power. Mr. Makoni appeared to be backed by high-ranking members of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe
African National Unity-Patriotic Front.
He also had the support of a breakaway faction of the MDC, led by Arthur Mutambara, a businessman and
Rhodes Scholar. He threw his weight behind Mr. Makoni on the premise that a divided opposition would
guarantee Mr. Mugabe a win.
The Zimbabwean government agreed -- after negotiations brokered by South African president Thabo Mbeki
and the Southern African Development Community, a respected regional body -- to implement new guidelines
aimed at ensuring a free and fair election.
But hope that this poll would be different has waned as the brief campaign season comes to a close. The
government hasn't implemented the reforms and has banned observers from countries that it says are critical
of Mr. Mugabe, which includes all European nations.
"We do not expect a free and fair election," said Andebrhan Giorgis, senior adviser for the International Crisis
Group's Africa program. "We're hoping for the best, but that's hope against hope."
According to a report by Human Rights Watch, an independent group, Zanu-PF supporters have harassed
and beat up opposition supporters. The report also said that government and party officials have bribed rural
voters with food and farming equipment, and withheld it from those who weren't registered Zanu-PF
members. The government has dismissed the report, saying that Human Rights Watch is biased against
Zimbabwe.
Both opposition candidates have highlighted the economic devastation in Zimbabwe, a country rich in
platinum and gold but wrecked by corruption and mismanagement. Inflation is the highest in the world, and
people have little food or running water.
Yet Mr. Mugabe is still popular in rural areas, where access to unfiltered information is scarce and people still
remember the president when he first came to power in 1980 as a young revolutionary who overthrew white
supremacist rule.
In a bid to keep those votes, Mr. Mugabe signed a bill into law this month that will allow locals to take majority
shares in foreign companies. Analysts fear the populist move could further devastate the shattered economy,
similar to his 2000 decision to hand over white-run commercial farms to untrained black workers.

Mukasey to Jump
The Bar Tuesday
----
By Evan Perez
Appearing before the Supreme Court Tuesday will be a figure more accustomed to being on the other side of
the room: former federal judge and current Attorney General Michael Mukasey.
His appearance will reprise a tradition that was dispensed with by the last two Bush administration attorneys
general, John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. Mr. Mukasey is set to argue the government's request to
overturn an appeals-court ruling in a terrorism case, and he acknowledges he is nervous.
Last fall, when he visited the court as part of his formal introduction to the job, he sat in on a case. "I watched
at least one judge interrupt what I thought was getting to be a responsive answer, with: 'Now answer my
question,'" he said. Reminded that Supreme Court judges are actually called justices, he deadpanned: "That's
something to remember."
Mr. Mukasey will be arguing the "millennium bomber" case, U.S. v. Ahmed Ressam. The government is
appealing a lower-court decision to strike one of the counts on which Mr. Ressam was convicted. Mr. Ressam
and an accomplice traveled by ferry from Canada to Washington state with plans to carry out a terror attack
on Los Angeles International Airport in December 1999. He was sentenced to 22 years on terror-conspiracy
charges.
The government argues the appeals court erred in its decision, which spares Mr. Ressam an extra 10 years
in prison for the explosives found in the car in which he was traveling.
Janet Reno, in 1996, was the last attorney general to argue a case before the nation's highest court, winning
a case that defended police procedures during traffic stops. Justices are known for not giving much deference
to attorneys general, treating them no better than other lawyers who often get interrupted as they try to deliver
arguments they spent weeks preparing.
To prepare for what Mr. Mukasey expects will be his first and only chance to appear before the nation's
highest court as the attorney general, he has been holding moot-court sessions. "Unlike Walter Dellinger [the
Duke University law professor who recently argued the District of Columbia's case defending its gun-ban law]
I haven't had the guts to invite people to watch," the attorney general said during a meeting with reporters at
Justice Department headquarters.
On the bench, Mr. Mukasey was known for sometimes having a stern and efficient demeanor, particularly if
lawyers appeared to be rambling in their arguments. He joked that some lawyers who appeared before him
are "going to be lining up in the street waiting for tickets" for a chance to savor watching him get interrupted
by the justices.
The attorney general said he jumped at the chance when he learned he could have the opportunity to argue a
case before the Supreme Court. He didn't pick which case to argue and said this one fit his schedule. Did he
have enough time to prepare? "I guess we'll find out on Tuesday," he said.

Dollar Pushes Higher Again

Dollar Pushes Higher Again

The beleaguered dollar got energized by a continued selloff in commodities that fueled its strong rebound
against major rivals including the euro.
The rally began Wednesday as crude oil and gold prices nose-dived from record highs set at the start of the
week. Talk of investors selling liquid assets to make up for losses from soured bets, as well as profit-taking
ahead of Easter, sparked more selling in commodities Thursday and crushed currencies whose fortunes are
closely tied to these markets.
Currencies from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada were among the hardest hit; the
Australian dollar fell below 90 U.S. cents, while the Canadian dollar reached its lowest point since January.
The euro, which has surged sharply during the past few weeks against the dollar, at one point fell below
$1.54, a big drop from the record high of $1.5905 it set Monday.
"It is deleveraging day in currency land," said Paresh Upadhyaya, who helps manage $29 billion in currency
assets at Putnam Investments in Boston. "People are reducing risks leading into the long weekend.
"With all these credit-market problems and slowing growth in the U.S., there is a big question mark whether
global growth is going to be sustained," Mr. Upadhyaya said. "Something has to give."
Late Thursday, the euro was $1.5417 from $1.5609 late Wednesday, while the dollar was 99.19 yen from
98.98 yen. The euro was 152.91 yen from 154.50 yen. The British pound was at $1.9838 from $1.9817, and
the dollar was at 1.0115 Swiss francs from 1.0005 francs.
The dollar got an extra boost in the afternoon after U.S. stocks surged as the Federal Reserve announced the
details of its first term security lending facility, in which the central bank will lend Treasurys to dealer banks in
exchange for a broad array of mortgage-related collateral.
That helped the dollar gain against the yen. But the Japanese currency outperformed the euro and other
major currencies as the coming long weekend and the selloff in commodities also spurred investors to unwind
popular carry trades.
In that process, investors who have borrowed from low-rate Japan to fund high-yielding investments
elsewhere had to buy back yen to repay some of the loans. Buying in yen was so heavy that it pushed the
euro below 152 yen.
Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com, a unit of online currency trading firm Gain Capital in
Bedminster, N.J., said that of all the major currencies, the yen is the safest investment at the moment, as the
Japanese financial sector appears to have little subprime exposure.
The Swiss franc, another popular funding currency for the carry trade, plunged against the dollar after Credit
Suisse Group warned that it was likely to post a first-quarter loss.
The British pound erased losses against the dollar after an unexpected surge in February's retail sales
dashed hopes of an interest-rate cut next month, helping sterling limit its decline after a steep downfall a day
ago.

Stocks in Hong Kong took a tumble but Shanghai rebounded, while European markets dropped for a second
session after Credit Suisse Group's earnings warning.
Mining and energy concerns also were sharply lower amid falling commodity prices.
Many markets will be closed on both Friday and Monday for Easter holidays. The U.S. is closed Friday but
open Monday.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index decreased 3.5% to 21108.22, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index fell 5.3% to 10836.20. Resource stocks dragged down both these markets and Sydney, Australia's,
after the Federal Reserve cautioned against inflation, triggering a correction in commodities including crude
oil and gold.
Shares of Aluminum Corp. of China declined 7%, PetroChina decreased 6.8% and gold miner Zijin Mining's
stock fell 14%.
"The weakness right across resources stocks, which up until now had shown some resilience to significant
market declines across the world, just further highlights the fact that we're seeing funds liquidating out of the
resource stocks," said Jamie Spiteri, head of trading at Shaw Stockbroking in Sydney. "The short-term
uncertainty continues to worry investors, and in particular many are concerned equities will continue to
perform inconsistently," said Mr. Spiteri.
Shares of Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China dropped 1.7% in Hong Kong and 5% in Shanghai after the
insurer announced it has agreed to buy a 50% stake in Fortis's asset-management unit.
In SHANGHAI, shares rebounded from hefty losses on the back of airlines. Steep declines for resource
shares such as Zhongjin Gold and PetroChina pushed down the Shanghai Composite as much as 6.5% in
the morning, but bargain buying in financials and airline stocks helped the index erase the losses and then
rise. Zhongjin Gold dropped 7.2% and Shandong Gold Mining dropped by the daily limit of 10%.
The benchmark index, which tracks both the yuan-denominated A shares and foreign- currency-denominated
B shares, finally ended the session 1.1% higher at 3804.05, a surge of nearly 290 points from the day's low at
3516.33, a level it hasn't seen since April.
Shares of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, one of the big losers in Shanghai in 2008, increased 6.5%
and China Merchants Bank climbed 4.6%. Shares of China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and
Hainan Airlines soared by their daily limit of 10% on the retreat in oil prices.
Participants said worries about continued monetary tightening by the Chinese central bank also weighed on
market sentiment.
"Investors are worried there could be an interest-rate rise by the end of the month," said Andrew To, a broker
with Tai Fook Securities in Hong Kong.
The recovery, on the other hand, was aided by hopes of increased institutional-investor buying, after the
Financial Times reported Beijing has temporarily suspended the collection of corporate taxes from mutual
funds.
In SYDNEY, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 3.1% to end at 5182.40, after it climbed as much as 4% in the
previous session. Resources were hit hard. Shares of BHP Billiton declined 8.3% (and 5.6% in London), Rio
Tinto lost 7.7% and Woodside Petroleum decreased 6.8%.

In TAIPEI, Taiwan's Weighted index rose 1.9% to 8337.62, on hopes of better ties with China after the
country elects a new president Saturday. China Airlines stock increased 5.3%.
In SEOUL, South Korea's Kospi inched up 0.1% to 1623.39. Shares of Korea Zinc dropped 6%. But Korean
Air was up 3%.
In TOKYO, the market was closed for Vernal Equinox. Trading resumes on Friday.
Meanwhile, in Europe, during the last session of trading before a four-day Easter break for most major
markets, the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 slipped 0.2% to 296.79. The United Kindom's FTSE 100,
an index that is home to many of the world's biggest oil and metals producers, fell 0.9% to 5495.20, the
German DAX 30 eased 0.7% to 6319.99 and the French CAC 40 weakened 0.5% to 4533.72.
In ZURICH, Credit Suisse stock dropped 7.1% after the company said it expects a first-quarter loss following
an internal probe into the valuation of certain asset-backed securities. " Credit Suisse's announcement puts
the publications of U.S. banks for the period ending Feb. 29 into perspective. It confirms that March has been
very tough with a widening in spreads for many types of highly volatile securities," said analysts at Raymond
James Equities.
In LONDON, the pain was focused on commodity producers. In addition to BHP's drop, Anglo American
finished down 8.1% and Antofagasta fell 6.7%. HBOS closed up 6.2%, regaining some of the ground it lost
Wednesday on rumors of a cash crunch.
In TORONTO, stocks ended the abbreviated week higher, spurred on by gains in technology and financial
stocks. The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 66.26 points, or 0.5%, to 12775.64, but declines exceeded
advances. Canadian markets are closed on Good Friday.
In SAO PAULO, Brazil's Bovespa index rose 159.95, or 0.27%, to 58987.31 as gains in the banking and
telecom sectors helped make up for weak perfomance by leading commodities-sector shares.

Dow Rallies 261.66 Points On Financials --- But the Risks of Selloffs Keep Investors Cautious;
Commodities Tumble

The financial sector led a furious stock-market rally as banks and brokerages snapped back from
Wednesday's selloff, while commodities prices continued their slide.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average retraced nearly all of Wednesday's 293-point loss to end the day 261.66
points higher, up 2.2%, at 12361.32. It was the Dow's third straight move of at least 200 points, led by jumps
of more than 8% in its components Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America. and
The industrials are now off 6.8% this year and 12.7% below their October record close.
But even on days with big gains, many investing professionals remain cautious about the market's prospects
over the next few months. Many say recent moves by the Federal Reserve, including the three-quarter-point
cut in its key interest-rate target Tuesday and its lending to investment banks, have helped calm the markets.
Still, the financial sector -- a bellwether for the broader market -- remains at risk of selloffs amid concerns
about further write-downs of bad credit bets, which could spark further volatility.
"The Fed has been very creative, and it has done a good job of getting risk capital on the move again," said
strategist Stephen Wood, of asset-management firm Russell Investment Group in New York. "But as long as
risk capital is on the move, it can leave a particular area of the market just as quickly as it comes in."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.4%, or 31.09 points, at 1329.51, off 9.5% on the year and
down 15.1% from its own October record. The broad measure was led by a 7.2% jump in its financial sector.
Among bellwether names in the sector, Fannie Mae shares soared 12% and Freddie Mac was up 9% after
analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods upgraded both to the equivalent of a "buy" rating from "hold," saying
that the recent easing of regulatory constraints on the mortgage-finance giants' lending should allow them to
contribute to increased activity in the broader mortgage arena.
But in a reminder of the risks still facing financials, CIT Group said it drew on its $7.3 billion in bank credit
lines, as it struggled to refinance debt that will be due in the next few months. The finance company's shares
plunged 17%.
Options and futures contracts expired, contributing to heavy trading volume. More than six billion New York
Stock Exchange-listed shares changed hands.
The commodity-price downturn continued, with the broad Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index falling 2%. Gold
futures tumbled $25.10 to $919.60 an ounce. Oil futures, a popular target for speculators in recent weeks,
fell 70 cents to $101.84 a barrel.
"We've all recognized that [oil has] run way past its fundamentals," said commodities broker Mike Fitzpatrick,
at MF Global in New York. He estimated that supply and demand, which is softening along with U.S.
economic growth, warrant a price around $86.
The dollar rose against the euro and the yen. The dollar briefly recaptured the 100 yen level but later slipped
to 99.19 yen, compared to 98.98 yen late Wednesday.
A stronger dollar tends to hurt commodity prices, which are traded globally in dollar terms. As the currency
strengthens, buyers need fewer dollars to obtain the same amount of raw materials they used before.
The availability of liquidity, or a critical mass of buyers and sellers needed to guarantee the smooth
functioning of markets, has worried traders and analysts for weeks. They have complained that even players

who have sufficient collateral on hand often shy away from conducting trades out of sheer worry, not because
they can't afford it on paper.
Hope has spread this week that situation may be getting better, although there may yet be a few nasty
surprises at individual companies. The Dow ended the holiday-shortened trading week up 3.4%, its best week
this month.
"People forget that financial crises tend not to last long," said Neil Hennessy, president of Hennessy Funds in
Novato, Calif. "No one can afford to have them last long, which is why regulators and whoever else is
necessary will step in to turn things around."
U.S. financial markets will be closed for Good Friday.

Commodities Lose Some Of Their Luster --- Broad Selloff in Gold, Oil Underscores Risk for Investors Who Piled In Seeking Safety
Commodities Lose Some Of Their Luster --- Broad Selloff in Gold, Oil Underscores Risk for Investors
Who Piled In Seeking Safety

It's a risky time for small investors to put their money into commodities, as yesterday's broad selloff shows.
Despite numerous bullish forecasts -- and a long-term rally that has seen record highs for gold and oil -- the
sector remains volatile.
Oil, gold and grain markets all took a dive yesterday, as investors bet that the Federal Reserve's
lower-than-expected interest-rate cut would calm fears of an inflationary spiral. This, in turn, lessened the
appeal of hard assets, whose prices tend to rise when inflation picks up, and underscores the markets'
vulnerability to further tumbles.
Although plenty of traders and analysts think raw materials will continue their multiyear run, a recent flood of
investor cash into the sector -- and yesterday's shakeout -- serve as warning signs that new money could exit
as quickly as it came.
It is often small investors who come late to the party, when prices are already lofty. Several analysts say
newcomers, both institutions and individual investors, are responsible for pushing up prices to
higher-than-predicted levels this year for everything from crude oil to copper and palladium as economic
news turned ever bleaker.
Adarsh Viswanathan, 32, a product manager at a high-tech company, is one of those newbies. He sold his
financial stocks in December and bought Agriculture Total Return, an exchange-traded note tracking the
RICI-Agriculture Index, as insurance against inflation. Since he bought it, the note has gone up about 11%,
and Mr. Viswanathan, of Santa Clara, Calif., is considering increasing his commodities exposure.
The commodities market "took a beating because it has gone too high over the last few months," he says.
"But if you look at the long-term cycle, the bullishness can only get stronger, because China, India and East
Europe -- they are all going to modernize."
Yet many participants aren't in it for the long haul, as this week's wild swings showed. Crude oil on the New
York Mercantile Exchange dropped 4.1% Monday, or $4.53 per barrel, only to surge 3.5% on Tuesday.
Similarly, gasoline reversed a 6.9% plunge on Monday with a 6.2% gain Tuesday.
Then, yesterday, commodities fell again across the board -- with oil falling 4.5%, or $4.94 per barrel, its
biggest dollar drop in over 17 years, and gold taking an especially deep dive of $58.50, or 5.8%. Gold's drop
was its biggest decline in dollar terms since Jan. 22, 1980.
There are many reasons for the big run-up in commodities over the past few months. Professional investors
normally active in the now-jittery credit and stock markets, for one, have been looking to park money
elsewhere while they ride out storms in those sectors. Oil and gold are easy picks as a hedge against
inflation.
Individuals, too, have been trying their hand at commodities in greater numbers, aided by easy-to-use new
investment tools such as exchange-traded notes and funds -- which trade on exchanges like stocks and can
hold hard assets directly -- and commodities-focused mutual funds. The weak dollar has also helped to push
prices higher, since commodities markets are denominated in dollars and it has been taking more of them to
buy hard assets.
Bob Milsom, a 63-year-old retiree in Washington, got interested in corn recently, thinking the growing use of
ethanol will give corn prices a push. He signed up for a grains newsletter from MF Global Ltd., a futures and
options broker, a few weeks ago and started following the crop. Now Mr. Milsom says he's "overwhelmed by
the market movement" and is leery about jumping in.

Peter Sorrentino, portfolio manager of the commodity-focused Huntington Real Strategies Fund, warns that
"there's so much money pouring into commodities right now, it [was] lifting them all uniformly. And I don't think
the fundamentals are supporting them all." Mr. Sorrentino says many investors have been shying from stock
bets until they believe that market has bottomed. In commodities, he sees a potential "mass exodus, as this
flow of money either stops or regresses itself back into other investment tools."
Other big risks loom. Although commodities have so far defied gloomy economic forecasts, a deeper global
recession could snuff out some of the robust new demand from developing countries.
What's more, banks that lend money to trading clients to finance their commodities bets are taking new steps
to shore up their cash cushions amid the global credit crunch. Over the past few weeks, many brokerage
houses and trade-clearing agents have required or are considering requiring futures traders to post more
collateral, or margin, to cover the daily fluctuations in the value of their bets, traders say.
If investors don't have enough cash to meet the margin requirements, they might have to close out some
positions to come up with more money -- which could drive prices down further.
Futures exchanges, which often clear, or stand behind, trades between parties, are also raising their margin
requirements. The Chicago Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain
Exchange in the past month have raised minimum margins for wheat futures due to the market's increased
volatility.
Yesterday's big drops also showed that profit-taking at these levels is tempting. In the week ended March 12,
mutual funds and exchange-traded funds investing in commodities futures and raw-material stocks
commanding total assets of $65 billion saw a net outflow of $485 million, the largest weekly drop this year,
according to EPFR Global, a research firm tracking global fund flows and asset allocation.
"The biggest risk is when speculators are all lined up on one side," as they are now, says Peter Kordell,
director of research at Jigsaw Commodities, a Minneapolis-based commodities broker. "When it comes to an
end, it's vicious because everybody is running for the door at the same time."
---
Hard Times For Hard Assets?
Yesterday's selloff shows how volatile commodities can be. Here are two
reasons why prices, after a long run-up, may be poised to fall further:
Some believe that fundamental demand doesn't support such lofty prices.
A global recession could cut demand for raw materials.

Gold, Oil Sag, as Dollar Firms --- Funds Moving Out After Recent Rally; Demand Weakens

Gold, Oil Sag, as Dollar Firms --- Funds Moving Out After Recent Rally; Demand Weakens

Crude oil and gold each suffered steep declines, as a slightly stronger dollar put commodities to rout.
March gold fell $58.50, or 5.8%, to $944.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange. This was the largest one-day fall since a $143.50 collapse in January 1980, when the metal was
especially volatile and hit records that stood until early this year.
Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery, a contract that expired yesterday, settled $4.94, or 4.5%, lower at
$104.48 a barrel on the Nymex. This drop was the steepest in dollar terms since January 1991, when the
U.S. launched its operation to oust Iraqi troops from Kuwait and simultaneously opened its strategic
petroleum reserve.
"What we're really seeing is complete shift of funds out of the commodity markets," said Mike Zarembski,
senior commodity analyst at brokerage firm optionsExpress Inc. In Chicago. "My quote board here is all red."
Over the past weeks, commodities prices have surged across the board as the dollar weakened against other
major currencies. A weak dollar gives foreign buyers greater purchasing power, which gives them greater
latitude in bidding up prices. A weaker dollar has also raised the specter of inflation, a boost to gold, which
historically has served as a hedge against broad-based price increases.
Gold closed firmer Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve's cut of benchmark interest rates by
three-quarters of a percentage point. However, prices began to soften in the after-hours trade following the
decision and those losses snowballed.
As the cut was smaller than some had expected, the dollar began to appreciate, a signal for some investors
to take profits. The topsy-turvy nature of the market made most participants hesitant to call yesterday's action
the beginnings of a major pullback.
"We're not flinching today," said Scott Meyers, senior trading analyst at Pioneer Futures in New York. "It's
commodity prices. We've come to accept these kinds of moves as not crazy."
Both oil and gold also were pulled down by developments in the physical markets. U.S. oil demand
weakened in the last four weeks compared with the year-earlier period, according to U.S. government data
for the week ended Friday. India, a large gold consumer, imported significantly less gold last year than a
year earlier due to rising prices.
In other commodity markets:
SOYBEANS: Prices fell to their daily exchange-imposed limit of 50 cents per bushel, pressured by
speculators liquidating bullish positions to take profit amid the U.S. economy's uncertainties. Soybeans were
hit by further tightening of bank credit for hedge funds, weakness in Asian vegetable oil markets that compete
with soybeans and a firmer U.S. dollar, pulling the rest of the grain complex lower. Chicago Board of Trade
May soybeans settled 50 cents lower at $12.57 a bushel.
COFFEE: Futures fell in a commodity-wide break as speculators pulled back on bullish positions. ICE Futures
U.S. coffee May coffee fell 4.60 cents to $1.3295 a pound.

Japan's Stock Rally to Nowhere? --- Tune In, Tokyo: Government Is Proving Impediment to Sustained Gains

Japan's Stock Rally to Nowhere? --- Tune In, Tokyo: Government Is Proving Impediment to Sustained
Gains

Tokyo -- Tokyo's stock rally yesterday is unlikely to be sustained. Before Japan has a long stock advance, an
increasing number of analysts are saying, clear signs are needed that the country is going to be
better-governed.
The Nikkei Stock Average rose 2.5% yesterday to close at 12260.44, after the big U.S. interest-rate cut eased
concerns over U.S. demand for Japanese products. Japanese stocks are still down about 30% since June.
That makes Japan the worst performer among major world markets, in spite of the relatively small direct
damage on Japanese financial institutions from the U.S. subprime-mortgage debacle.
Japanese stocks are now cheap by world standards. One measure showing this is price-to-book-value ratios,
or PBRs, calculated by dividing a company's share price by its net assets. The average Japanese PBR is
1.45, the lowest of major economies, according to S&P Citigroup World Indices. That of U.S. stocks is 2.53.
On Monday, the PBRs of nearly three-fifths of the companies trading on the first section of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange were less than one -- meaning it would be more profitable for shareholders to liquidate the
company and divide the assets among themselves.
The trouble is, such action to get more value out of a company is hard in Japan, where companies make
elaborate efforts to avoid getting taken over. In the past, that usually meant developing webs of
cross-shareholdings, in which companies hold mutual stakes -- usually when they have some kind of
business relationship.
Now, some companies use other techniques, such as so-called poison pills, to dilute the stake of an
unwanted suitor. Some analysts date the start of Japan's stock-price declines to an incident in June, when
condiment maker Bull-Dog Sauce adopted such a strategy to prevent a takeover by Steel Partners Japan
Strategic Fund (Offshore), a fund run by U.S. investors. A Tokyo court declared the defense legal.
"Japan . . . has no market for corporate control," said Patrick Mohr, a strategist at Nikko Citigroup. "You don't
have an active M&A market. People can't come in and take a company out for lots of different reasons,
mainly cultural."
He said investors are waiting for a major event signaling that Japan will have more merger-and-acquisition
activity and find ways to increase corporate value. This could come in the form of a landmark takeover -- of
one of the country's giant electronics conglomerates, for example. Some of these possess cutting-edge
technology, but their earnings are dragged down by other, less-competitive divisions.
Another such event might be the emergence of a leader such as pro-market former Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi. The stock market soared under Mr. Koizumi as he pushed economic deregulation and other moves
to shrink the size of the government. (Political analysts have said a comeback by the popular Mr. Koizumi is
unlikely.)
But instead of some such positive signal, investors are getting a series of indications that the government is
even weaker than they thought.
For the second time in a week, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda yesterday suffered parliamentary rejection of a
candidate he had nominated to succeed Toshihiko Fukui as head of the Bank of Japan. This has left the
country without a central-bank governor, as of Thursday.
While the operations of the bank will likely be unaffected -- another member of the board can become acting
governor until a new one is found -- economists said the fiasco illustrates serious flaws in the way Japan is
governed.

First, it shows the current administration is weak. Mr. Fukuda miscalculated in his tactics in dealing with the
opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which controls Parliament's upper house and so has veto power over
some personnel appointments, including that of the Bank of Japan governor.
He bet that the opposition party would approve his nominations in order to avoid being seen as responsible
for a vacancy at the top of the central bank. But the opposition rejected Mr. Fukuda's candidates, anyway,
making him look ineffectual.
"The prime minister's authority has declined, which means that Fukuda's time in office will be shortened," said
Morgan Stanley economist Takehiro Sato.
Second, the trouble over the Bank of Japan governor points to problems with Japan's more fundamental legal
and constitutional setup. For example, one way to ensure that an impasse over confirmation didn't result in a
vacancy would have been to let the incumbent bank governor stay in office until Parliament approved a
successor.
Mr. Fukui wasn't allowed to remain beyond Wednesday, as the bank's laws weren't designed to cope with a
Parliament where different political groupings controlled different chambers.
European Indexes Decline
On Finance-Sector Jitters
European shares fell Wednesday as persistent worries about the financial sector hammered United
Kingdom-listed mortgage banks and a plunge in the price of gold sank miners.
Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson skidded 7.8% in Stockholm after its mobile-phone-making joint venture with Sony
issued a profit warning. Fears of an industry-wide slowdown sent shares of competitor Nokia down 5.9%.
Those losses helped make the technology sector the worst-performing area of the Dow Jones Stoxx 600.
Overall, the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index fell 1% to 297.48.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 fell 1.1% to 5545.60. HBOS ended down 7.1% after declining as much as 17% on
speculation about its financial health. The shares recovered some of the losses after the U.K.'s biggest
mortgage lender denied liquidity problems.
Miners fell as prices for gold, copper and other metals skidded. Copper specialist Antofagasta lost 4.9%, and
platinum miner Lonmin dropped 6.9%.
In FRANKFURT, the DAX 30 lost 0.5% to 6361.22. An update from Deutsche Telekom disappointed
investors, dragging shares of Europe's largest telecommunications company down 6.9%. The company said
revenue at its T-Home German fixed-line and broadband division would fall 4% to 6% this year and adjusted
operating profit is seen declining 5% to 8%. Some traders interpreted the targets as a profit warning, although
the company kept its 2008 outlook.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 declined 0.6% to 4555.95. BNP Paribas rose 4.7%, in part because it ruled out a bid
for rival French bank Societe Generale, which fell 7.1%.

Is the Bubble
In Commodities
Bursting?
While trying to clean up the mess of one bubble this week, the Fed might also have unexpectedly hastened
the end of another.
Oil, gold and other commodity prices have soared recently, much higher than what would seem to be
fundamentally justified. They took a big tumble in the other direction yesterday, with gold posting its biggest
dollar decline in 28 years and oil its biggest loss in 17 years.
One cause of the selling seemed to be Tuesday's interest-rate decision by the Fed, which didn't lower rates
as much as markets expected. Moreover, in its statement accompanying the cuts, it spent a surprisingly large
amount of time harrumphing about inflation risks. That seems to have eased concerns that the Fed was
prepared to toss out its inflation-fighting mandate.
Hedge funds and other investors that had pumped cash -- much of it borrowed -- into commodities might now
be having second thoughts. If the Fed is serious about fighting inflation and will be more reluctant to cut
rates in the future, then the run-up in commodities prices might be running its course. Moreover, if the
economy gets weak enough to damp inflation on its own, that's also poison for commodities, as it means
slumping demand for oil, steel, wheat and other hard assets.
The deleveraging process gripping Wall Street is another important factor. If the downdraft in commodities
prices continues, hedge funds and other traders that made bets on raw materials with borrowed money could
be forced to sell their holdings and unwind those bets.
A commodities meltdown would be good news for consumers, who've had enough of high gas prices. But it
might not help the financial sector. For many banks and investors, commodities investments had been the
only thing going up lately, besides delinquencies.
The FedEx Indicator
Is Pointing South
Transportation companies like FedEx offer a window into the pernicious effects of a slow economy and rising
commodities costs.
Slow growth and high energy costs seem to have squeezed FedEx's third-quarter earnings, due to be
reported today. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect it to post net income of $1.22 a share, down
10% from a year ago.
Rival UPS warned last week that it could miss first-quarter earnings targets after six straight weeks of
negative volume in its U.S. package business. Kurt Kuehn, UPS's chief financial officer, said "across a very
broad segment of our customers there is a slowing in shipping needs."
High energy prices and weakening demand have also thumped truckers. The American Trucking
Associations expects truckers to spend $135 billion on fuel this year, up 20% from 2007. Several trucking
companies describe the environment today as the worst they've seen, say Morgan Keegan analysts.

Trouble in transports signals a bad outlook more broadly. FedEx shares tumbled in 1999, before the rest of
the market. The " FedEx Indicator" seems to be working well again. Its shares started dropping in July and
are down 26% since then. The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't start slipping until October.
Lower commodities prices would help the transports now. But energy costs would have to fall a lot before
really sinking in.

Commodity Declines Aid Dollar

A selloff in commodities and a declining British pound helped the dollar recoup its early losses against the
euro.
Investors have sold the dollar heavily during the past few weeks to buy hard assets such as gold and oil, and
now they are selling those positions, generating a wave of short-covering in their bets against the dollar. Gold
shed 5.8%, and crude oil fell 4.5%, amid talk of hedge funds and banks forced to sell hard assets to meet
margin calls and deal with funding difficulties.
Commodity-linked currencies, including Australia's dollar, New Zealand's dollar, Canada's dollar and South
Africa's rand were all under water against the U.S. currency yesterday.
The British pound suffered throughout the day against the dollar and the euro, hammered by speculation of
interest-rate cuts and worries about liquidity issues in local financial markets.
The yen, however, was on solid ground against the dollar and the euro as tumbling U.S. stocks triggered risk
aversion and unwinding of the popular carry trade. In that process, investors who had borrowed in
low-yielding yen to fund high-yielding investments elsewhere had to buy back yen to repay some of their
loans. Japan's borrowing cost, at 1%, is the lowest among industrialized nations.
Late yesterday, the euro was at $1.5609 from $1.5636 Tuesday, while the dollar was at 98.98 yen from 99.56
yen. The euro was at 154.50 yen from 155.67 yen. The pound fell to $1.9817 from $2.0081; the dollar was at
1.0005 Swiss francs from 1.0017.
Just Monday, the dollar had struck a record low of $1.5904 per euro.
"Much of the dollar recovery is on the back of weaker commodity prices and the further unwinding of
European currencies prompted by the selling off in [sterling/dollar] as a result of credit fears stemming from
U.K. banks," said Matthew Kassel, director of proprietary trading at ING Financial Markets LLC in New York.
The dollar started to move off its lows of the day after better-than-expected earnings from Morgan Stanley
and the clearance of federally chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more home loans.
Then, the selloff in commodities, coupled with a tumbling British pound, helped the dollar recover further from
its overnight decline.
In Shanghai, a record low for the dollar-yuan central parity and the central bank's increase in the reserve
requirement ratio pushed the Chinese currency to a modern-era high against the dollar.

Crude Oil Jumps 3.5% As Hedge Players Return

Crude Oil Jumps 3.5% As Hedge Players Return

Crude-oil futures ended 3.5% higher after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate reduction prompted a
late-session surge.
Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled at $109.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a gain
of $3.74 for the day. The contract expires today. The day's gains nearly erased Monday's drop, which was the
biggest one-day percentage loss since August.
Futures rose by about $2 yesterday morning and spent most of the day at that level, with activity light as the
market awaited the Fed's decision, which came just 15 minutes before the close. The three-quarter
pecentage-point cut failed to match widely held expectations of a full-point move. Nevertheless, crude soared
above $109 on the news -- in large part because investors drawn to the market by monetary policy had
nowhere else to go, said Addison Armstrong, an analyst with TFS Energy in Stamford, Conn.
"The funds who are clearly in charge of these markets really don't have any other way to play it at this point,"
Mr. Armstrong said. "They can't find a return anywhere else other than commodities markets, where there's
momentum and there's liquidity."
The Fed's moves are closely watched by commodities traders for their effect on the dollar. Cuts to interest
rates tend to weaken the U.S. currency, which in turn tends to buoy oil prices as investors seeking a hedge
flood into commodities.
The dollar weakened slightly against the euro and the yen after the cut was announced, but later
strengthened.
The Fed's actions may have given the crude-futures market renewed strength, enough to overcome
Monday's big drop and resume the two-month-old rally, said Peter Donovan, a vice president at Vantage
Trading in New York. "This is definitely going to put [talk of a correction] on the back burner," Mr. Donovan
said.
The market's attention now turns to the Department of Energy's weekly oil and product inventory data, which
is expected today. Crude-oil and gasoline stockpiles are expected to have increased in the week ended last
Friday, while analysts forecast that distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, decreased.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Futures were modestly firmer, but was largely range-bound as the market awaited the outcome of a
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, traders said. April gold rose on the Comex division of the
Nymex $1.70 an ounce to $1,004.30. In the thinly traded after-market session, gold futures fell, slipping back
under $1,000 after the Fed rate cut.
COFFEE: Prices rose off the steep losses incurred Monday, as speculators bought while other commodities
rose. ICE Futures U.S. May arabica coffee settled up 1.55 cents to $1.3755 a pound.

Credit Worries Ease as Fed Cuts, Hints at More Relief --- Stocks Jump 3.5% In Rally Reflecting Cautious Optimism
Credit Worries Ease as Fed Cuts, Hints at More Relief --- Stocks Jump 3.5% In Rally Reflecting
Cautious Optimism

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve continued its two-front attack on the credit crunch with a steep rate
cut, and hinted at more to come.
The cut was less than financial markets wanted. But in a sign the Fed's prior efforts to boost lending through
unconventional means may be getting some traction, stocks soared, buoyed by earnings reports from two big
investment banks.
The Fed cut its short-term interest-rate target 0.75 percentage point to 2.25%, not the full point that markets
had been expecting. It was the largest disappointment the Fed has delivered to markets since the central
bank began cutting rates in September. the move was also a signal that because of the Fed's concerns
about inflation, it expects its other initiatives to bear more of the burden of stimulating growth.
For at least a day, investors cheered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 300 points ahead of the rate
cut on a growing conviction the Fed's prior efforts to funnel cash to credit markets would work. Though stocks
lost a chunk of their gains right after the 2:15 p.m. rate-cut announcement, they surged back to close up
420.41 points, or 3.5%, at 12392.66.
Financial stocks did especially well. Shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings, under sharp pressure lately,
soared more than 46%. Goldman Sachs shares rose over 16%. Both reported first-quarter earnings that,
while off more than 50% from a year ago, were better than expected, prompting descriptions of the market
surge as a relief rally.
The dollar improved against both the euro and Japanese yen after the Fed announcement. The U.S. currency
has fallen sharply in recent weeks as global investors questioned the Fed's commitment to resisting inflation,
a worry that has sent money pouring into gold, oil and other inflation hedges. Oil sold off briefly after the
announcement but then rose to close up $3.74 a barrel at $109.42.
Though less than expected, the interest-rate cut was substantial. Yesterday was only the second time the
Fed has cut so much since it began announcing its rate moves in 1994. The central bank now has cut
short-term interest rates a full three points since September, the fastest pace of easing in decades.
This reflects the speed with which a slump in housing and subprime mortgages has spiraled into a broad
credit crunch, weakening financial institutions and making it harder for a broad swath of businesses and
households to borrow. Most economists now think the U.S. is in a recession, with the debate shifting to how
deep it will be.
Recognizing that, the Fed signaled in its end-of-meeting statement that the prospect of more rate cuts
remains on the table. "The outlook . . . has weakened further," it said. "Consumer spending has slowed and
labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit
conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth." It said
"downside risks to growth remain," and the Fed will "act in a timely manner as needed."
Nonetheless, the Fed has increasingly come to the view that lower rates alone won't restore order to the
financial markets and prevent a severe recession. It has rolled out ever more creative and aggressive
attempts to infuse cash into market corners where it normally doesn't operate, culminating in Sunday's
decision to lend to investment banks from its "discount window," a privilege previously reserved for
commercial banks. Chairman Ben Bernanke also has publicly backed action to use public money to stem a
tide of mortgage defaults and foreclosures.
The Fed's actions are among several aggressive steps throughout the federal government that are coming to
a head this week and could prove critical in combating the crisis. Today the regulator of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, which provide the bulk of funding for home mortgages, is to announce an easing of their capital

--- Page 60 ---
Page 60 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
requirements and the companies are to pledge to raise more capital, people familiar with the matter said.
Those steps should enable them to back more mortgages.
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration which has so far resisted using large amounts of public money to save
borrowers and lenders from bad loans, may be ready to compromise with Democrats on a more activist
approach to the housing crisis. The Fed is "running out of pages in its playbook to address the growing crisis
of credit and confidence," Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, who has proposed the Federal
Housing Administration insure up to $400 billion in troubled mortgages, said yesterday. Now the Bush
administration should be "equally aggressive."
Yesterday, the Fed expressed more concern about prices than after its Jan. 30 meeting. "Inflation has been
elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen," it said. While the Fed still expects
inflation to ease as commodity prices plateau and as higher unemployment blunts wage and price gains, it
said that "uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor
inflation developments carefully."
With the economy continuing to weaken, the Fed remains concerned about what some officials describe as
an "adverse feedback loop" of economic weakness, tighter lending and further weakness. It is thus likely to
cut interest rates again.
But the elevated concern about inflation in the statement suggests the Fed does think it's getting close to the
bottom in interest rates. Some analysts speculate the Fed could trim rates before its next scheduled meeting
on April 29-30, but many think that's unlikely unless the outlook or markets get markedly worse.
The futures markets reduced the expectation they are showing for additional cuts. The futures now see the
federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, easing to between 1.5% and 1.75% by year's
end. Before yesterday's move, futures investors were betting the rate would fall to 1.25% to 1.5%.
The Fed also lowered the rate charged on direct "discount window" loans it makes available to banks and --
since Sunday -- to investment banks. It slashed the rate to 2.5% from 3.25%, keeping it a quarter-point above
the federal-funds rate. Commercial banks began lowering their prime interest rates, to which some
variable-rate loans are tied, to 5.25% from 6%.
Highlighting the depth of the Fed's inflation concerns, two of the 10 voting members of the policy-setting
Federal Open Market Committee voted against the 3/4-point cut. Charles Plosser and Richard Fisher,
presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Dallas, "preferred less aggressive action at this
meeting," the Fed said.
A worsening of both inflation and economic growth in the past month has made FOMC decisions more
fractious. Each of the past five rate-cut decisions has triggered at least one dissent -- one favoring a bigger
cut and the others favoring less. Yesterday's was the first meeting with two dissents since 2002.
Messrs. Plosser and Fisher have been the most outspoken about inflation risks, but most other Fed
policymakers are also uncomfortable with the recent deterioration in inflation psychology. The decision to
trim the federal-fund rate less than markets expected appears, at least in part, a way to convey both that the
Fed isn't panicking and that the central bank is weighing consequences of its actions on inflation
psychology.
The economy is hardly out of the woods. Investor confidence remains fragile just days after the Fed made an
unprecedented loan to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns Cos., exposing how deeply the credit squeeze
had penetrated the U.S. financial system. Sunday's statement that the Fed would lend to investment banks,
and on the same terms as to commercial banks, was the boldest step the central bank has taken so far to
employ its own balance sheet to take some riskier debt off the hands of financial institutions.
The stresses in the credit markets have kept some of the Fed's rate-cutting efforts from filtering through to
borrowers. The average rate on 30-year mortgages fell to 5.5% in December from 6.4% in July when the
crisis began; but then the rate went above 6% in February, even though the Fed had been cutting short-term
rates since September.
After the Fed a week ago said it would lend up to $200 billion in Treasury securities to bond dealers in return
for mortgage-backed securities, mortgage rates fell to 5.74% from 6.2%, according to Bankrate.com.
Rates on "jumbo" mortgages above $417,000 -- until recently, the biggest that could be guaranteed by Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac -- are higher now than in July, because banks have trouble finding investors to buy
securities backed by such loans. The Fed's move a week ago to lend to bond dealers also knocked down
rates on jumbo loans, to 7.02%.

Bank Credit Analyst, a financial research service, said a decline in rates other than those on super-safe
Treasury bonds "would be the key indication that conditions are finally improving. If that does not happen,
then the Fed will be forced to consider more drastic action, including direct purchases of securities."

News of stubborn inflation couldn't stop a relief rally in stocks, as earnings reports from Lehman Brothers
Holdings and Goldman Sachs Group provided no unpleasant surprises for investors still rattled by last week's
collapse of Bear Stearns. provided no unpleasant surprises for investors still rattled by last week's collapse of
The market roared higher from the opening bell to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 420.41
points, or 3.51%, to 12392.66 by day's end. All 30 Dow components finished higher, led by an 11% gain for
Citigroup. Other financials also rose. J.P. Morgan Chase was up nearly 6%.
The rally endured despite some disappointment that the Federal Reserve didn't cut interest rates as much
as some had expected when it announced a three-quarters of a point reduction in its key lending rate in the
afternoon. In fact, stocks extended their surge after a brief push lower on the news failed to gather
momentum.
It was the Dow's biggest point gain since July 2002, although the nearly 417-point gain just a week ago was
slightly greater in percentage terms. That gain, however, was almost entirely reversed by Friday.
"You see these one- or two-day rallies and it fizzles out," said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned
Davis Research. The Dow industrials remain 13% below their record close in October and down 6.6% so far
this year.
Until stocks can show evidence of follow-through buying after big rallies, "the best way to play this market is
to give the benefit of the doubt to the downtrend and don't be too quick to try and pick a bottom," Mr. Hayes
said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.24%, or 54.14 points, to 1330.74, its biggest percentage gain
since October 2002. The 4.19% gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index was its largest in percentage terms
since March 2003.
The Russell 2000 index of small companies stocks surged 4.83%, with a 31.45 point gain that was the largest
in the index's history.
Still, from their highs in October, the S&P 500 is down 15% and the Nasdaq is off 21%. The Russell is off
20% from its high last July.
A measure of how bad things have gotten lately is that the earnings reports that sparked yesterday's rally
showed profits cut in half at a pair of Wall Street's biggest firms. Lehman posted a 57% drop in its fiscal
first-quarter net, due to losses in its fixed-income business, and Goldman said its fiscal first-quarter profit
dropped 53%, in part due to $2 billion in losses on mortgage and other credit investments.
But both reports were better than expected and provided some relief to Wall Street about the health of both
firms' balance sheets.
Lehman, whose shares fell 19% Monday, rebounded 46%, although they remain down 9% since the end of
February. Goldman Sachs rose 16%. Investors had been nervously awaiting the earnings reports, wondering
if either firm would show signs of the kinds of strains that led to Bear Stearns's downfall.
The rally briefly faltered at midafternoon, reducing the gains, after the Fed's announcement that it was
lowering the target for its key federal-funds rate by three-quarters of a point to 2.25%. Although an aggressive
move by historical standards, it disappointed some in the market who had been betting on a
full-percentage-point cut.

In the bond market, some noted that two Fed officials dissented from the decision and argued for a
less-aggressive rate reduction.
In addition, the Fed said in its announcement that while the outlook for economic activity has weakened,
"uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased." Earlier in the day, the Labor Department reported
that its producer-price index rose 0.3% in February, with a 0.5% increase excluding volatile food and energy
costs.
"The Fed is trying to address some of the concerns that some in the markets have had that it's been reckless
on the inflation front," says Jim Caron, interest-rate strategist at Morgan Stanley.
The stock-market rally picked up as the afternoon wore on. The combination of the inflation news and surge
in stock prices led to a big downdraft in prices of Treasury securities, sending yields higher.
The dollar rose against the yen and the euro while gold hit another new Comex record in New York, settling
at $1,003.20 per troy ounce.

HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam is trying to unshackle its fast-growing economy from the sliding U.S. dollar, a
tactic that might stem rampant inflation but is rattling exporters and Vietnamese who have been using
greenbacks as a daily currency for years.
Earlier this month, Vietnam decided to partially abandon its de facto dollar peg as part of an effort to curb the
highest inflation rates it has seen since 1995. After considering the move for several weeks, the central
bank on March 10 widened the band in which it allows the Vietnamese dong to rise or fall against the dollar in
one day to 1% from 0.75% previously. The bank said it plans to expand the band to 2%, and the black market
is already pricing the dong much more strongly than the official rate -- a striking reversal of the days when the
dollar commanded a premium on the backstreets of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
Freeing the dong will let it strengthen against the dollar "and will help tame the higher cost of oil and other
imports," says Vo Tri Thanh, head of the Institute of Economic Planning, a state-run advisory group.
Dollar-based prices of those items are relatively cheaper when translated into a strengthening Vietnamese
currency.
The result for many Vietnamese is a sudden loss of confidence in the dollar, a currency widely used here as a
convenient alternative to the unwieldy dong. The largest Vietnamese note is the rarely seen 500,000 dong
bill. It is worth about $31.
Tellers at branches of Military Bank, among others, have begun turning away visitors trying to exchange
dollars for dong. They say banks worry the dollar's value will fall further. Some exchange counters are
unplugging digital displays showing buy and sell prices for foreign currencies in the hope it will put people off
trying to sell dollars. Ordinary savers are draining dollar accounts to make dong deposits instead, while others
are turning to gold as a safe harbor.
Some of the country's biggest exporters, meanwhile, have written letters to Vietnam's leaders pleading for
help as their dollar-based revenue slumps. Unable to exchange their dollar income for local currency, some
are having to borrow dong to cover their local costs.
Other countries are also allowing their currencies to appreciate against the dollar to tackle inflation. They
include China, which has allowed its currency to rise around 3% against the dollar this year. Kuwait last year
began pegging its dinar to a basket of currencies instead of solely to the dollar. Other Persian Gulf states are
also studying whether to change their dollar pegs.
But few nations have been as dependent on the dollar for their economic progress as Vietnam. The dong's
virtual peg -- a narrow trading band set by the central bank that allowed the dong to rise or fall 0.75% a day
-- helped provide investors with the confidence they needed to put money into a country that only began
opening up to foreign business in the early 1990s.
The popularity of dollars was boosted further by Vietnamese who settled in the U.S. after the Vietnam War
and who regularly sent dollars home to their families.
When the dollar began its decline in 2002, the narrow trading range helped boost Vietnamese textiles and
electronics exports because they were cheaper for U.S. customers than similar products made in Thailand,
Malaysia or the Philippines. This helped Vietnam become a stellar performer in a high-achieving
neighborhood; its economy has grown by an average of 7.5% a year since 2000.
Later, the dong's tendency to follow the dollar contributed to an inflationary bubble as rising prices of oil and
other commodities -- as well as Vietnam's unchecked growth -- began to affect the country's economy.
Inflation hit a 13-year high of 15.7% in February, prompting a series of stiff measures designed to suck
money out of the local banking system.

The most radical response was to widen the band in which the dong is allowed to trade. Since the band was
widened on March 10, the official, central-bank rate for the dollar has fallen a slim 1%, from 16,030 dong to
15,855 dong. But on the black market, where currencies are traded in gold shops and cafes and from which
banks are increasingly taking their lead, the dollar was fetching 15,500 yesterday. That is 3% off the March
10 rate, and an indication that Vietnamese think worse is to come as America's financial problems multiply.
Vietnamese are now trying to get their hands on as much local currency as they can. With the U.S.
apparently falling into recession, banks are reluctant to buy dollars from exporters or individuals.
Vietnam's small stock market, Asia's best performer in 2006 before fading in 2007, has buckled under the
severity of the adjustments now under way. Stocks first slumped when the central bank ordered local
lenders to buy up government bonds in order to drain dong from the financial system and put a cap on
inflation. After the band widened and the dollar began its fall, investors worried that foreigners wouldn't be
able to find enough dong to buy stocks. On some days, there has been hardly any trading.
The government has responded by announcing that its sovereign wealth fund would buy up shares of the
country's leading companies, a measure that some government advisers have privately criticized as distorting
the true value of the market.
The VN Index at the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange in Ho Chi Minh City has fallen nearly 50% off its peak of
1170.67 in March last year. Yesterday the index closed at 588.26 points.
With trading volumes dwindling, some stock traders are now venturing into more liquid sidelines. Tran Thi
Hong Lan, a director at VinaSecurities Co. in Hanoi, last week opened a new restaurant in the city with a
partner to tap Vietnam's growing tourism industry, a venture she had planned before the dong was freed from
its dollar peg. "Cash is king," Ms. Lan says, predicting that when the stock market recovers, it will rise along a
more modest trajectory than before.
The Vietnam Association of Shrimp Exporters recently sent a petition to the Minister of Agriculture pleading
that the central bank instruct local banks to convert their dollar earnings into dong.
Phan Van Danh, head of the An Giang province seafood cooperative, told local newspapers that seafood
processors are now buying less from local fish farmers because they can't make enough money exporting
fish. Mr. Danh says 50,000 to 70,000 tons of fish have been left unsold since the dong was unshackled from
the dollar.
Despite its inflation problem, Vietnam is still a cheaper place to do business than many other parts of Asia.
Foreign manufacturers continue to flow into the country, and this could keep upward pressure on prices, say
economists such as Song Seng Wun, who covers the Southeast Asian economy at CIMB-GK Research Pte
Ltd. in Singapore.

Bear Stearns's Ripples Reach Corporate Sector
Bear Stearns's Ripples Reach Corporate Sector

Corporate executives woke up to a gloomier business outlook yesterday morning.
In recent weeks, economic barometers and talk of recession had already made CEOs wary. But the collapse
of financial titan Bear Stearns Cos. has intensified the sense that no business is immune and that the
financial crisis could touch every business, from makers of construction machines to retailers and telephone
companies.
Dyke Messinger, president of Salisbury, N.C.-based Power Curbers Inc., a maker of machines that pour
cement curbs, just got back from a trade show in Las Vegas. The mood there was "cautiously optimistic," he
says, but that was before the collapse of Bear. "When you have a shock like this, the question is whether the
optimism that was still there will go into the tank."
He now fears customers will cut back more than they already have -- his U.S. business is off by about a
quarter -- while the slowdown could now stretch far into 2009. Even before this latest shock, he had cut his
yearly budget for capital expenditures more than 60% to less than $100,000. "We've said we're not going to
spend any money unless it's necessary to keep a machine running," he says.
The problems on Wall Street come at a time when the economy is already flirting with recession. In the latest
signal of underlying weakness, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday that its index of industrial production
dropped 0.5% in February, while the New York Fed's widely watched Empire State manufacturing survey
plunged to a negative 22.23, a low for the index, which measures general business conditions.
For many companies, the mess on Wall Street is just another signal that the U.S. is headed into a prolonged
downturn. That, in turn, feeds a growing sense of caution that could make a sharp recession inevitable. Mark
Bissell, president of Bissell Homecare Inc., a privately held maker of vacuums and other floor-care items in
Grand Rapids, Mich., says his business grew about 10% in the first quarter. During downturns, people tend to
stay home more and try stopgap approaches such as shampooing dirty carpets rather than buying new floor
coverings.
"But given what I see going on today, if there were a big acquisition opportunity for us -- where we'd have to
become leveraged -- I probably wouldn't do it," Mr. Bissell says. "Now is not the time to make risky moves."
The financial crisis has already made it harder to do deals, and it is altering the structure of many of the
buyouts that do occur. Gary Rodkin, chief executive of ConAgra Foods Inc., says the worsening credit crunch
means food companies like his won't be making acquisitions unless they can use cash or stock. That's bad
news at a time when ingredient costs are soaring and margins are being squeezed.
"Getting the financing done, whether on our side or the other, is impossible," he says. "It's crystal clear:
Financing is almost nonexistent."
The lack of credit may be slowing restructuring in such businesses as consumer products, where many
companies are considering shedding operations. For instance, Procter & Gamble Co., which announced this
past August that it was "more likely to be a seller of businesses than a buyer," to date has split off only its
Folgers coffee business. "That process seems to be slower than usual," says SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
analyst Bill Chappell. He blames the recent credit crunch for the sluggishness of other possible P&G
divestitures, such as the Braun small-appliance unit and the pet-food division. "In a normal market there
probably would be plenty of buyers to take those businesses off their hands quickly," Mr. Chappell says. A
spokeswoman for P&G declined to comment.
Michael Kanazawa, chief executive of Dissero Partners, a management consultancy based in Oakland, Calif.,
says that in the past, companies could often sell troubled businesses to private-equity firms, which would then
turn them around. Today, companies will have to turn around their struggling businesses themselves.

--- Page 71 ---

Kevin Coyne, a management consultant and professor at Emory University's business school, says the credit
crunch is especially hard on small businesses and start-ups, which are seen as riskier bets and typically need
financing to implement their ideas. The financing shortage can have a dampening effect on innovation, he
says. For example, smaller telecom providers, such as wireless Internet start-up Clearwire Corp. and
struggling Internet phone specialist Vonage Holdings Corp., are already having a tougher time tapping the
credit markets, analysts and people close to those companies say.
Meanwhile, the problems are hitting retailers at both ends as customers snap their wallets shut and retailers
attempt to finance their normal operations. Women's clothing retailer Talbots Inc. has struggled in recent
weeks to persuade banks to increase its working-capital lines of credit. As a result of slow sales and the tight
credit markets, the Hingham, Mass., retailer is cutting expenses, opening fewer stores and buying less store
merchandise as it tries to conserve funds. It did strike a deal with one lender on Friday to increase a credit
line.
Of course, some companies are benefiting from the current conditions. For those with plenty of cash, for
instance, now is a good time to buy. As of the end of last month, Illinois Tool Works Inc., Glenview, Ill., had
already completed 13 acquisitions in 2008.
In the energy sector, many larger oil companies have taken advantage of years of historically high prices to
clean up their books. Both Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have more cash on their balance sheets
than debt. And unlike Wall Street firms, oil companies' value is in hard assets, including petroleum reserves,
pipelines, refineries and drilling rigs.
Many companies are also benefiting from the drop in interest rates. Dan Ariens, CEO of lawnmower maker
Ariens Co., in Brillion, Wis., says he is now paying about a full percentage point less on a loan package
negotiated at the end of last year. At CVS Corp., Chief Financial Officer David Rickard says the interest rate
the Woonsocket, R.I., company pays on $1 billion in commercial paper has dropped two percentage points to
3.5% in the past month, a decrease that translates into millions of dollars of savings on interest payments.

Crude-Oil Futures Fall Sharply --- Gold Still Shines, Holding $1,000 For the First Time

Crude-Oil Futures Fall Sharply --- Gold Still Shines, Holding $1,000 For the First Time

Crude-oil futures closed sharply lower yesterday as fears stemming from the takeover of Bear Stearns Cos.
at a rock-bottom price hit commodities hard.
Meanwhile, gold set a milestone, with the nearby-month contract settling above $1,000 a troy ounce for the
first time. Gold tested the level last week.
Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell $4.53, or 4.1%, to settle at $105.68 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The percentage drop was the largest since Aug. 6, and oil hasn't fallen this much in
dollar terms since January 1991, when the U.S. launched an operation to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait and
simultaneously opened its strategic crude reserves.
The April crude contract managed to hit $111.80, the eighth straight session where a record was set, in
electronic trading yesterday. But futures quickly declined by more than $6 from those levels. Prices reacted to
an across-the-board selloff in response to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. agreeing to acquire Bear at a massive
discount.
The deal, along with the Federal Reserve's emergency cut to its discount rate Sunday, provided further
evidence of serious problems in capital markets. Declines in banking-sector stocks led to a wider drop in the
stock market -- causing investors to pull out of other markets, including commodities.
"People liquidate positions because they need money for other things," said Mark Waggoner, president of
Excel Futures. "Sometimes they just bail out of everything."
Silver and copper prices fell, while gold, the traditional safe haven in tough times, shed most of its big early
gains in the broader liquidation trend. Still, Comex gold for March delivery gained $3.20 per troy ounce, or
0.3%, to end at $1,001.40.
In grains, soybeans, corn and wheat all tumbled by the maximum amounts allowed by exchange rules. Sugar
and coffee both fell more than 10%.
"You're seeing massive risk aversion," said Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management.
"Everybody is getting out of everything, in every commodity."
The energy complex was particularly hard-hit, including a 6.9% drop in reformulated-gasoline blendstock, or
RBOB, futures. This is the biggest drop for the front-month contract in its Nymex trading history.
"Today was such carnage . . . sometimes I thought it was just throwing the baby out with the bath water," said
Kevin Mallon at Prebon Energy, who called the decline in RBOB "overdone."
This isn't the first major decline for crude futures since they took off in late January. April crude dropped 2.9%
March 4, only to settle at a high the next day.
Analysts and traders said yesterday's selloff was different, however. "It's been pretty much a one-way market
for a long time, and it can't go on forever," said Tom Bentz, with BNP Paribas. "At some point, you're going to
get corrections."

Fed Passes First Test: Stocks Stabilize

Fed Passes First Test: Stocks Stabilize

The nightmare scenario didn't happen.
The effective demise of Bear Stearns, the nation's fifth-largest investment bank, threatened to spread chaos
through financial markets when trading opened. But stocks ended the day mixed after clawing back from
significant early losses, the dollar declined -- but not steeply -- and credit markets showed modest signs of
stability.
Among major indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was down more than 190 points at its
intraday low, ended up 21.16 points, or 0.2%, at 11972.25, driven by a gain of 10.3% in the shares of J.P.
Morgan Chase, which scooped up Bear Stearns for $2 a share.
But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.9%, or 11.54 points, to 1276.70, led by a 3% drop in its
financial components. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index also was off.
Gold futures officially topped $1,000 a troy ounce for the first time, as the nearby-month contract rose $3.20
to $1,001.40 -- the first close above $1,000 of the front-month contract.
The orderliness of trading marked the passage of an important test for the Federal Reserve, which has
undertaken unprecedented steps to keep markets calm in recent days.
"Without the Fed acting as lender of last resort, today could have been much worse," said Mickey Levy, chief
economist at Bank of America.
But sentiment remains deeply wary, and the Fed faces its next test today, when officials meet to consider
how much to cut the benchmark federal-funds rate. The Fed is expected to cut rates by anywhere from half a
percentage point to one percentage point.
Earnings reports from Lehman Brothers Holdings and Goldman Sachs Group are also sure to attract intense
market scrutiny after the collapse of Bear Stearns. Lehman shares lost 19% of their value yesterday -- after
tumbling by nearly 50% at one point -- as investors worried that another big investment bank could hit the
rocks because of financing problems. Morgan Stanley shed 8% and Merrill Lynch fell 5.4%.
The Fed said during the weekend that it would allow certain brokerage firms to borrow from the central bank
on the same terms as commercial banks. In addition, it has said it would provide as much as $30 billion in
financing to backstop the less liquid holdings of Bear Stearns.
The moves were important because securities dealers had been finding private money markets shutting down
on them, because of fears about the value of the collateral they used as short-term loans.
The gain in J.P. Morgan alone provided 30.69 points of the Dow's advance. By mid-afternoon, the pressure
began to lift among non-financial stocks.
Faring particularly well were shares health-care companies, which tend to do relatively well during an
economic downturn, as well as technology stocks, which have taken a beating lately. Dow component
Johnson & Johnson rose 2.2% and Microsoft was up 1.2%.
The Dow industrials are now 16% below their record close in October, while the S&P 500 is 18% below its
own October record.
With expectations for more Fed easing, Treasurys rallied, particularly short-term securities, as investors dove
into the safe-haven of these liquid government securities.

--- Page 75 ---

As prices rose, the yield on the one month T-bill plummeted to 0.51%, from 1.17% on Friday, while the
Treasury's $24 billion auction of three-month T-bills was met with strong demand to yield 1.1%, the lowest
rate since May 2004.
Elsewhere in the credit markets, there were glimmers of improvement in the wake of the Fed's actions. The
gap in the yield on the average 30-year government agency mortgage-backed security over the five-year
Treasury note fell to 2.8 percentage points from 3.05 points on Friday. "The Fed's actions have helped us
bounce back and prevent a meltdown" in mortgage-backed securities, said Art Frank, head of
mortgage-backed securities research at Deutsche Bank. "It was a spectacular day for mortgages."
But the dollar fell, trading as low as 95.72 yen during the day, its lowest level since August 1995. The euro hit
a fresh record against the greenback at $1.5747.

Exchange-traded funds tracking stocks around the world fell yesterday as the collapse of Bear Stearns Cos.
and the efforts by the Federal Reserve to avert a potential run on banks stoked fresh credit fears.
The broad-market SPDR S&P 500 ETF traded lower by more than 1%; the Dow Diamonds ETF initially
dropped a similar amount but was up slightly by day's end as the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced
higher.
Banking stocks were also weak following news of the Fed-assisted bailout of Bear Stearns, which was
scooped up by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in a deal that values Bear at $2 a share. The stock hit an intraday
52-week high of $159.36 in April 2007.
A highly traded financial ETF, S&P Financial Select Sector, lost 2.3% by day's end. An international version,
iShares S&P Global Financials, was off 2.1%. (ETFs are similar to mutual funds, except that they are listed
on exchanges and trade all day like stocks.)
Although the Bear Stearns news helped drag down markets, the firm's stock didn't contribute too much to
financial ETFs' declines because most had "modest positions in the firm, which had already seen its
weighting plummet because of the drubbing the stock has taken for the better part of 15 months," wrote Jeff
Ptak, Morningstar Inc.'s director of exchange-traded securities analysis, in a research note.
The Financial Select ETF had only about 0.3% in Bear Stearns as of March 13, he said.
"The key question, of course, is which shoe will be the next to drop amid manifold signs that a massive
deleveraging cycle is heavily stressing the capital markets," Mr. Ptak wrote. "It's possible that we could see
other banks and very large hedge funds fail, though the magnitude of any fallout is difficult to gauge."
KBW Capital Markets ETF, which invests in broker-dealers and other financial stocks, lost nearly 7%.
However, a fund designed to provide leveraged inverse exposure to the financial sector, UltraShort Financials
ProShares, rose nearly 4% and is up 35% over the previous three months as a result of the credit turmoil and
banking write-downs.
Conversely, an ETF that makes a leveraged bet on financials, Ultra Financial ProShares, was down nearly
4%. International and emerging-markets stocks also felt the pain of the global selloff, including iShares MSCI
Emerging Markets and iShares MSCI EAFE, an ETF following an index of international developed-markets
stocks.
In bonds, iShares Lehman 20+ Treasury Bond was up nearly 1% as investors bought up safer bonds and
pushed yields lower. Another haven, StreetTracks Gold Shares, rose about 0.5% as precious metals, which
are seen as a hedge against inflation and disaster, continued their rally.
Weakness in the dollar pushed the CurrencyShares Euro Trust, which tracks the movement of the greenback
versus the euro, up by 0.5%.

How can $20 billion in Bear Stearns market value evaporate overnight? Though many are asking this
question today, few are noticing the fact that, since 2002, trillions of dollars worth of business and
U.S.-government debt value has evaporated. This happened because the Federal Reserve has neglected the
dollar.
There is much talk now about restoring "trust" in U.S. financial markets. You cannot restore trust while
signaling that no steps will be taken to prevent the further fall of the greenback. Capital, be it to shore up
financial institutions, or buy up much-devalued U.S. assets -- in terms of some currencies, U.S. real estate
has plunged by more than 40% -- will stay on the sidelines as long as the Federal Reserve and the
government do not take action to fix monetary policy.
In a Financial Times op-ed the other day, Alan Greenspan says that a measure of stability will be restored
when house prices stabilize, which may be accurate. But why would capital flow into real estate denominated
in dollars that are still expected to plunge?
The view expressed on this page by former Federal Reserve Board member Robert McTeer -- that the Fed
now must give priority to the liquidity crisis and neglect the dollar -- is inaccurate, too. The liquidity crisis and
the stable dollar are related. The vast extension of credit since 2002 could have never happened if the Fed
had sustained a stable value for the dollar. And by stable, I do not refer to focusing on short-term "core
inflation," which has been leaving out food and energy prices and mismeasuring much else.
There were many signals suggesting that the Fed has been mismanaging the dollar, which, with the
mismanagement of the yen and the uncertainty of the unique euro (the first paper currency not anchored in
either gold or backed by a government), became the sole reserve currency in the late 1990s. When one
manages a reserve currency, it needs an "outside" anchor to keep global credit expansion under control. The
Fed has not provided one, which it could have done by keeping the dollar stable compared to gold and other
commodities.
There are many "moneys" in circulation -- a few of them domestic and others foreign. We have $100, $10 and
$5 bills. We also have quarters, dimes and pennies, and an array of foreign currencies circulating. They all
function as a medium of exchange here and around the world. The U.S. denominations stay in fixed relation
one to the other, whereas the others have been fluctuating by 50% or more relative to one another.
Ask then: Why can the $10 bill always be exchanged for 40 quarters, whereas it varies daily in terms of how
many foreign units it can be exchanged for? After all, the demand for the $10 bills and quarters fluctuates.
With fewer parking meters, more automatic machines accepting credit cards and more cell phones, the
demand for quarters has been dropping, and the demand for paper bills rising. Why doesn't the value of the
quarters drop relative to the $10 bill? The answer is that as fewer coins are being used, they get returned to
the central bank, which perhaps sells them as scrap metal, issuing $10 dollar bills instead.
This same process can work for any two currencies of two different countries. If people decide that they
intend to spend less in the U.S., they show up at a bank or brokerage house and ask to exchange their
unwanted U.S. dollars for, say, Canadian ones. The Fed notices that the demand for the U.S. dollar
decreased, so it absorbs the unwanted U.S. dollars by selling U.S. denominated bonds on the open market
(or selling Canadian dollars or Canadian dollar-denominated bonds).
The exchange rate between the two countries stays stable -- pretty much as the "exchange rate" between the
two U.S. denominations stays stable. Technically, the value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar can be
as easily fixed as the value of the one U.S. denomination relative to another.
But why is it important to keep exchange rates between two countries stable to start with?

Whereas we can have as many mediums of exchange as we want, we must price goods and services, and
get into longer term contractual agreements, to ensure stable capital flows. But should we price in euros or in
U.S. dollars? Or, as has been done for centuries, in terms of gold?
What matters is to have an agreed-upon unit of account in terms of which trading partners could price every
contractual agreement, preferably having the medium of exchange serve as the unit of account, too. This
anchor is missing in the international monetary system today, and is one reason for the financial havoc
surrounding us. The volatility around a downward trend of the U.S. dollar -- which was closest to playing the
unit of account/exchange double role for half a century -- has diminished its efficiency for these uses. As a
result, contracts are shorter. Companies pay substantial insurance fees (and derivative contracts are in the
trillions) to stay in their line of business and not get into exchange-rate trouble. Resource-rich countries keep
their resources in the ground longer, rather than selling them for papers with uncertain values. And some
investors have been loosing substantial amounts by holding bonds of devaluing currencies. Now people are
deciding not to invest in U.S. dollar-denominated assets.
The issue isn't that "we will never have a perfect model of risk," as Mr. Greenspan appears to think. What we
need is accountability, not perfection. With the proper anchor, central banks can sustain a stable value for
their currency, and that is what they must be held accountable for. If they do that, even if financial institutions
experiment with a wide range of innovations they cannot expand credit too much.
Crises bring us back to the basics. There is prosperity when talent is matched with capital and everyone can
measure in a predictable unit of account. Stable currencies bring about long-lasting, wealth-creating
employment. The destruction of wealth by debasing currencies occasionally "creates" employment (with
people being forced to accept lower-paying second and third jobs) but it signals poverty, not prosperity.

CME Moves Closer to a Deal for Nymex
Deals & Deal Makers
CME Moves Closer to a Deal for Nymex
By Aaron Lucchetti

Chicago Mercantile Exchange operator CME Group Inc. moved closer to a pact to buy Nymex Holdings Inc.,
a $9.3 billion deal that expands the CME into energy trading while underscoring the importance of technology
to exchanges.
The deal, set to be announced as soon as this morning, would end more than 135 years of independence for
the New York Mercantile Exchange, Nymex's oil and gas market. Boards from both companies met yesterday
to vote on the transaction.
The CME purchase would mark the latest union between two exchanges once split by products and
geography, but now pushed together by market forces and customer demands for lower costs. Nymex
shareholders are expected to receive cash and CME shares worth about $100 each, valuing the company at
$9.3 billion.
The combined exchange will have offices in both Chicago and New York, uniting CME's financial and
agricultural products with Nymex's energy and metals contracts. Nymex's energy business would stay in
Manhattan for at least five years -- an important detail to gain support of New York politicians such as Sen.
Charles Schumer -- though not necessarily at its current location in the Financial District.
Nymex's business has boomed as investors bet on the soaring prices of oil and gold, two of Nymex's largest
contracts. In 2007, Nymex traded 25 million gold-futures contracts, up 57% from the previous year, and 121
million crude-oil futures, a 71% jump that made it the busiest commodity futures contract globally, according
to the Futures Industry Association trade group.
On the strength of those contracts as well as growth in natural gas, silver and copper trading, Nymex sold
shares to the public in late 2006. But exchange analysts never viewed Nymex as a likely survivor in the
exchange merger game because it lacked the core trading technology that puts buyers and sellers together.
Instead, Nymex signed an agreement to use CME's technology, which also powers CME's trading in its
bellwether contracts based on stock indexes and short-term interest rates.
Last year, CME bought the owner of the Chicago Board of Trade, the bond and grain exchange that
previously used a European company for the technology to match buyers and sellers.
As exchanges grow larger, the companies that own them are finding it increasingly important to own the
technology used to match buyers and sellers. Last year, NYSE Euronext said it would buy the remaining
stake it didn't own in AEMS, a financial- technology vendor it used for much of its trading.
NYSE and Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., with the latter's recent purchase of exchange and technology company
OMX AB, are both hoping to sell more financial technology to brokerage firms and other exchanges in coming
years. Merging with OMX gives Nasdaq more "ability to deliver sophisticated exchange technology to both
developed and emerging markets," Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq's chief executive, said recently.
In the derivatives business, where hedge funds and other sophisticated investors make high-stakes bets with
borrowed money, exchanges that didn't own technology often have sold to technology owners. Even the
electronic options market, International Securities Exchange Holdings Inc., outsourced much of its technology
to OMX. Last year, ISE sold to Eurex, a large European derivatives exchange that develops its own
technology.
Another options and stock market, the American Stock Exchange, has disclosed plans to sell to NYSE
Euronext, after years of being known for innovative products but lackluster trading technology.

Like many exchanges, Nymex had relied on open-outcry trading, where jacket-clad traders gathered in a pit
to set market prices based on frantic buying and selling. With the advent of electronic trading, more
customers demanded bypassing the pits to cross trades in cyberspace. When Nymex delayed adopting
electronics, Wall Street customers launched rival energy exchange IntercontinentalExchange Inc., which
remains Nymex's most formidable competitor.
The Chicago exchanges -- CME and the Chicago Board of Trade -- faced similar electronic threats from
European exchanges and others who wanted to take away their financial futures business. But the two
exchanges were able to fight off competition by embracing electronics and have become the dominant
traders of exchange-traded derivatives.
That dominance could become an issue as the CME and Nymex attempt to gain antitrust and other regulatory
approval to close their deals. The Justice Department recently wrote a letter raising the idea of whether
futures exchanges should open up their lucrative clearing divisions to more competition, essentially making it
look more like the cutthroat stock and stock-options trading businesses in the U.S.
CME officials have fought that idea, saying most futures exchanges overseas have the same business model.
But in this deal, regulators must come to terms with approving a company that would, upon closing, have the
vast majority of U.S. futures trading.

Natural Gas Rides High, for Now --- Prices May Ease As New Supplies Reach the Market

Natural Gas Rides High, for Now --- Prices May Ease As New Supplies Reach the Market

Natural-gas prices are near two-year highs and outpacing price increases for oil, driving up costs for
companies and consumers.
But many market watchers predict a fall in coming months, as new supplies come to market following years of
flat production.
The price of gas hit $9.868 per million British thermal units Friday after topping $10 earlier last week, as
investors spooked by the stock markets and worries about the U.S. economy poured money into commodities
like oil and gold. Gas is up 32% since the start of the year, putting it near its highest level since hurricanes
Katrina and Rita hit the gas-rich Gulf of Mexico nearly three years ago.
Gas meets about a fifth of the nation's electricity needs, heats about half of its homes and is an important
ingredient for making plastics and fertilizer. The fuel is increasingly in demand because it burns more cleanly
than coal.
Analysts cite a variety of factors for gas's run-up in addition to the general rise in commodities. They include a
colder-than-expected winter; falling production in Canada; and rising demand for oil, which has been
propelled by investors seeking a safe haven.
"I don't think we would have hit $10 [per million BTUs] if crude oil wasn't up at $100 [a barrel]," says Guy
Gleichmann, president of United Strategic Investors Group in Hollywood, Fla., which doesn't have an
investment in gas.
The rise comes at a time when oil-and-gas companies, citing long-term trends, are redoubling efforts to find
new gas supplies. Driving the trend: concerns over pollution and climate change. The U.S. Natural Gas
Council, an industry group, predicts a carbon-capping system such as one now being considered by
Congress could lead to a 20% increase in natural gas consumption over the next decade.
"We clearly see that people are rejecting coal plants in every state we can think of, so we've got to come up
with alternatives that work for the American consumer," says James Hackett, chairman and chief executive of
Anadarko Petroleum Corp., one of the nation's largest producers of natural gas. "The power market will
increasingly turn to natural gas as its one alternative."
Those efforts are adding new gas supplies to the market after a decade of flat or falling production.
Production last year rose 4.3% according to one government measure, marking the largest rise in more than
20 years. Most expect production to continue to rise this year.
Over the short term, that could lead to new supplies that drive down prices later this year. Summer pricing
predictions vary widely, but most analysts say natural-gas storage figures released last week would support
summer prices around $7 to $8 per million BTUs.
"At some point these high production rates are going to push prices down," Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan
Wolff says.
J. Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James in Houston, predicts prices could drop to $5 per million
BTUs or lower over the summer, especially if warm weather reduces demand in coming weeks.
Many wells being drilled today require gas prices above $7 per million BTUs to be viable, and exploration in
emerging areas such as the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania could be even more expensive.
Some market watchers expect prices to remain high in coming months. Natural gas producers may have
trouble keeping up last year's growth rate, they say. Offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico shot up 7% in

--- Page 82 ---

December from the previous year, but that growth was almost entirely due to Independence Hub, a massive
new offshore drilling project that went online late last year. With no similar projects anticipated in the
immediate future, most analysts expect offshore growth to level off this year or next.
Meanwhile, onshore production growth has relied heavily on the increased production in Texas and
Wyoming, which together accounted for 78% of onshore growth last year.

The Buck Stops Where?
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Buck Stops Where?

In the credit market panic that began in August, we have now reached the point of maximum danger: A global
run on the dollar that could become a rout. As the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee prepares to
meet tomorrow, this should be its major concern.
Yet the conventional wisdom -- on Wall Street and in Washington -- continues to be precisely the opposite. In
this view, the Fed is "behind the curve" and needs to cut interest rates even faster and further than it has.
Never mind that this is precisely the path the Fed has followed since August, yet the crisis has grown worse
and now bids to tank the larger economy. Does it make sense to do more of what isn't working?
---
The Fed's main achievement so far has been to stir a global lack of confidence in the greenback. By every
available indicator, investors are fleeing the dollar for other currencies and such traditional safe havens as
gold and commodities. Oil has surged to $110 a barrel, up from under $70 as recently as September. Gold is
above $1,000 an ounce, up from $700 in September, and food prices are soaring across the board. The euro
has hit record heights against the buck, and for the first time the dollar has fallen below the level of the Swiss
franc.
Speculators are adding to this commodity boom, betting that the Fed has thrown price stability to the wind in
order to ease U.S. housing and credit woes. The problem is that dollar weakness is making both of these
problems worse. The flight from the dollar has made U.S.-based investments less attractive, at a time when
the U.S. financial system urgently needs to raise capital. And the commodity boom is translating into higher
food and energy prices that are robbing American consumers of discretionary income. In the name of
avoiding a recession, reckless monetary policy has made one more likely.
Meanwhile, and disconcertingly, we keep hearing new explanations for the virtues of dollar weakness. One of
the most popular is that the increase in commodity prices has nothing to do with the dollar but is merely a
change in "relative prices" -- commodities compared to other goods -- caused by surging global demand.
No doubt strong world growth explains part of the commodity price rise this decade. But the dollar price of oil
has surged by some 60% since September, even as U.S. growth has slowed sharply. If the dollar had merely
retained its value against the euro, oil would be in the neighborhood of $70 a barrel. Dollar weakness
explains a large part of the oil price surge.
We are also told that the U.S. is merely importing inflation from the rest of the world, such as China. Import
prices have surged nearly 14% in the last year, but that is mainly recycling the inflation that the Federal
Reserve has inspired. Like other countries that have linked their monetary policies to the U.S., China has
been importing inflation due to dollar weakness. Its official price level has tripled in a year, and it is now
letting the yuan rise more rapidly against the dollar to slow that domestic inflation.
Kuwait has already dropped its dollar peg to stem its inflation, and other Persian Gulf countries may follow
suit. These are all signs that the world is losing confidence in the Fed's commitment to price stability.
Another excuse is that a weak dollar is useful because it helps to boost exports, and thus reduces the U.S.
trade deficit. Exports have certainly been strong, but exports in goods are being more than offset by the rising
cost of oil imports. In January, the U.S. trade gap actually widened thanks to oil imports. In any case, rising
exports won't comfort Americans whose standard of living falls due to rising import prices.
Then there is the "just deserts" school, which claims that dollar weakness is the inevitable result of America
living beyond its means for so long. This road-to-perdition view is especially popular in Europe and the U.S.
media. To believe it, however, you have to conclude that the world was willing to ignore the U.S. trade deficit
for decades only to awaken in horror now.

The truth is that, as ever, the fate of the dollar is in our own hands. Inflation is always a monetary
phenomenon, determined by the supply and demand for a currency. The supply of dollars is controlled by a
monopoly known as the Federal Reserve, and at any moment the Fed can produce more or fewer dollars.
The Fed can also influence the demand for dollars by maintaining a commitment to price stability, or it can
reduce that global demand by squandering its anti-inflation credibility the way it is now. Once squandered, it
is difficult to regain -- as we learned the hard way in the 1970s and 1980s.
The Bush Administration is also not helping confidence in the dollar. While President Bush is doing well to
fight protectionism and higher taxes, his Administration continues to give the impression that it quietly favors
a weak dollar. Yes, the official Treasury mantra is that it prefers a "strong dollar." But that mantra was the
same when the dollar was strong and oil was $20 a barrel in the 1990s as it is now when oil is $110 and the
dollar is weaker than at any time since the 1970s.
Last week Mr. Bush dared to wander from this script and told the Nightly Business Report that a strong dollar
"helps deal with inflation" and rued its weakness against the euro. He was quickly reeled in by his advisers,
and in his Friday speech at the New York Economic Club Mr. Bush reverted to the boilerplate language that
investors now interpret as favoring a weak currency.
---
Which brings us to tomorrow's Fed meeting. The markets are expecting another cut of 50-75 points in the
benchmark fed funds rate, and if recent history is a guide will immediately price into futures another 50-point
cut down the road. The stock market may rally, until it once again decides that easier money can't remedy
what is fundamentally a problem of bank solvency. That problem can only be resolved by financial institutions
and regulators coming to grips with the losses, raising more capital to cushion the blow, and closing or selling
those banks that can never recover. That will require a more aggressive, and pre-emptive, regulatory role for
the Fed -- and that we would applaud.
What the U.S. and world economy don't need is a Fed that continues to insist that inflation expectations are
"well-anchored" when everyone else knows they aren't. The Fed needs to restore its monetary credibility, or
today's panic could become tomorrow's crash.

Debt Reckoning: U.S. Receives a Margin Call
Debt Reckoning: U.S. Receives a Margin Call

The U.S. is at the receiving end of a massive margin call: Across the economy, wary lenders are demanding
that borrowers put up more collateral or sell assets to reduce debts.
The unfolding financial crisis -- one that began with bad bets on securities backed by subprime mortgages,
then sparked a tightening of credit between big banks -- appears to be broadening further. For years, the U.S.
economy has been borrowing from cash-rich lenders from Asia to the Middle East. American firms and
households have enjoyed readily available credit at easy terms, even for risky bets. No longer.
Recent days' cascade of bad news, culminating in yesterday's bailout of Bear Stearns Cos., is accelerating
the erosion of trust in the longevity of some brand-name U.S. financial institutions. The growing crisis of
confidence now extends to the credit-worthiness of borrowers across the spectrum -- touching American
homeowners, who are seeing the value of their bedrock asset decline, and raising questions about the
capacity of the Federal Reserve and U.S. government to rapidly repair the problems.
Global investors are pulling money from the U.S., steepening the decline of the U.S. dollar and sending it
below 100 yen for the first time in a dozen years. Against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies, the
dollar has fallen 14.3% over the past year, according to the Federal Reserve. Yesterday it hit another record
low against the euro, falling 2.1% this week to close at 1.567 dollars per euro.
Lenders and investors are pushing up the interest rates they demand from financial institutions seen as solid
just a few months ago, or demanding that they sell assets and come up with cash. Banks and Wall Street
firms are so wary about each other that they're pulling back. Financial markets, anticipating that the Fed will
cut rates sharply on Tuesday to try to limit the depth of a possible recession, are questioning the central
bank's commitment or ability to keep inflation from accelerating.
There are other symptoms of declining confidence. Gold, the ultimate inflation hedge, is flirting with $1,000
an ounce. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., predicted Thursday that large
financial institutions still need to write down $135 billion in subprime-related securities, on top of $150 billion
in previous write-downs. Ordinary Americans are worried: Only 20% think the country is generally headed in
the right direction, nearly as low as at any time in the Bush presidency, according to the latest Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll.
"Clearly, the whole world is focused on the financial crisis and the U.S. is really the epicenter of the tension,"
says Carlos Asilis, chief investment officer at Glovista Investments, an advisory firm based in New Jersey.
"As a result, we're seeing capital flow out of the U.S."
That is a troubling prospect for a savings-short, debt-heavy economy that relies on $2 billion a day from
abroad to finance investment. It is raising the specter of the long-feared crash in the dollar that could further
rattle financial markets and boost U.S. interest rates.
Though the risks of an unpleasant outcome are worrisome, the effects of Fed interest-rate cuts and fiscal
stimulus have yet to be fully felt by the U.S. economy. Moreover, the combination of a weakening dollar --
which remains the world's favorite currency -- and still-growing economies overseas is boosting U.S. exports
and offsetting some of the pain of the housing bust and credit crunch.
But while cash continues to pour into the U.S. from abroad, this flow has been slowing. In 2007, foreigners'
net acquisition of long-term bonds and stocks in the U.S. was $596 billion, down from $722 billion in 2006,
according to Treasury Department data. Americans, meanwhile, are investing more of their own money
abroad.
Hopes are fading fast that the U.S. economy was suffering from a thirst for liquidity that standard Fed
remedies could quench. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, speaking in Washington yesterday,

--- Page 86 ---
Page 86 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
said he sees "an increasing risk that the principal policy tool on which we have relied -- the Federal Reserve
lending to banks in one form or another" -- is like "fighting a virus with antibiotics."
Bob Eisenbeis, a former executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, says the problem is
more than an inability to find ready buyers for assets. "It is time to step back and recognize that the current
situation isn't a liquidity issue and hasn't been for some time now," said Mr. Eisenbeis, the chief monetary
economist for Cumberland Advisers. "Rather, there is uncertainty about the underlying quality of assets --
which is a solvency issue, driven by a breakdown in highly leveraged positions."
President Bush, speaking in New York and in a television interview yesterday, showed little appetite for
further action. Detailing the steps the administration has already taken, the president in a speech knocked a
couple of pending proposals. "Government policy," he said, "is like a person trying to drive a car on a rough
patch. If you ever get stuck in a situation like that, you know full well it's important not to overcorrect --
because when you overcorrect you end up in the ditch."
But few in markets and elsewhere are convinced that the worst is over for the U.S., as each player moves to
protect its own interests against potential calamities seen as improbable just a few months ago. Bear Stearns
reassured investors earlier this week that it was solvent, but speculation that Bear faced a liquidity crunch had
some traders and hedge funds moving to limit their exposure to it. Yesterday, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York offered emergency funds to keep the troubled investment bank afloat.
The loss of confidence is now spreading beyond the biggest banks, with their well-publicized losses on
subprime and other risky assets, to regional and small banks. In the fourth quarter, U.S. banks reported their
smallest net income -- a total of $5.8 billion -- in 16 years, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
There's little sign yet that the worst is past. The "moment of recovery" is when forecasters turn out to be too
pessimistic, says Mr. Summers. That point hasn't likely arrived. A Wall Street Journal survey of more than 50
economic forecasters in early March found a profound shift toward pessimism: About 70% say the U.S. is
currently in recession, and on average they put the odds that this recession will be worse than the past two
mild, short recessions at nearly 50%. Most expect house prices to decline into 2009 or 2010.
This couldn't come at a worse time for U.S. homeowners. American household debt has more than doubled in
a decade to $13.8 trillion at the end of 2007 from $6.4 trillion in 1999, the vast majority of it in mortgages and
home equity lines, according to Fed data. But the value of U.S. householders' biggest asset -- their homes --
is now falling.
The response of the Republican White House, Democratic Congress and Federal Reserve have been
substantial. President Bush and Congress, with remarkable speed, agreed to a $160 billion fiscal-stimulus
package that will put money in consumers' wallets soon. The Fed already has cut interest rates by 1 1/4
percentage points this year, and markets anticipate another 3/4 point cut on Tuesday. The Fed has moved to
buy $400 billion worth of mortgage-backed securities for its $800 billion total securities portfolio in an effort to
jolt that crucial market back to life and prevent rising mortgage rates from further depressing the U.S. housing
market.
While there is continued debate about how to treat the current disease, there is a consensus emerging on the
causes. "Soaring delinquencies on U.S. subprime mortgages were the primary trigger," the heads of the
Treasury, Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission said in a lessons-learned report.
"However, that initial shock both uncovered and exacerbated other weaknesses in the global financial
system."
Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University economist, says the current difficulty has many mothers -- the housing
bubble, the subprime problem and the fact that the value of U.S. imports has long outstripped the value of
exports. The current account deficit -- the broadest measure of the trade deficit -- burgeoned, and the U.S.
needed to borrow ever larger amounts of cash from abroad to fund it.
For years, Mr. Rogoff and like-minded economists harped that the U.S. current account deficit was
unsustainable. But despite the belief that it would necessarily reverse, it kept growing through the first part of
this decade, going from 3.6% of gross domestic product at the end of 1999 to a record 6.8% at the end of
2005. Lately, the deficit has seen a slight narrowing, but the combination of credit crisis and the economic
downturn may have proved the catalyst for a faster, and potentially more dangerous, adjustment.
Pressures in one market spread rapidly to other, often more distant markets. "The dollar and subprime --
they're two sides of the same coin," says Princeton University economist Hyun Song Shin. Many U.S. hedge
funds and financial institutions were speculating in mortgage-related securities with money that was ultimately
borrowed in Japan, where interest rates have been low for years. He notes foreign banks' net liabilities in the
yen interbank market surged between April 2006 and April 2007. As investments bought with money
borrowed in Japan get sold and converted back into yen, he says, "we see both a fall in asset prices and a fall
in the dollar."

The resulting blow to confidence threatens to further weaken lending, borrowing, spending and investment in
the U.S. economy. "Hedge fund blowups have so far been one-off situations. One worry is that we'll cross
some line and there'll be a systemic wave of fund failures. It's a reason why the market is so nervous," says
John Tierney, credit derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank.
Banks also are increasing the collateral they demand when they lend to hedge funds that hold municipal
bonds. One hedge fund manager described what appears to be a coordinated effort by big investment banks
to reduce their risk as they faced quarter-end pressures to cleanse their balance sheets. Lenders declared
"by fiat," he said, that municipal-bond-fund managers needed to post more collateral to back their borrowings.
As a result, funds run by Blue River Asset Management, 1861 Capital Management and others circulated lists
of assets to raise cash. The sell-off flooded the market with municipal bonds, making it more expensive for
municipalities to borrow and upending the traditional relationship between tax-exempt municipal bonds and
taxable U.S. Treasury bonds. For the first time in memory, yields on tax-exempt municipal bonds jumped
above yields on taxable U.S. Treasury debt.
Now, many hedge fund managers say, access to borrowed money, essential for many of their investment
strategies to work, has become virtually impossible.
Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief executive officer of Allianz SE's Pacific Investment Management Co., says the
hedge-fund community is unwinding its leverage. "This will push more of them into 'survival mode,' further
accentuating distressed sales and nervousness among the prime brokers," he wrote to his colleagues
Thursday morning. "In such a world, the quality of the assets matters less than whether you can finance them
[or] how liquid they are."

Stocks were pummeled after a plan to alleviate a liquidity crisis at Bear Stearns sparked concerns about the
depth of the problems in the already roiled financial markets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher Friday, boosted by better-than-expected inflation data,
before developments in the financial sector pushed the index down more than 300 points early in the session.
The industrials finished down 194.65 points, off 1.6%, at 11951.09, with 29 of its 30 components in the red.
Bear's stock price tumbled 47% after the firm turned to J.P. Morgan Chase and the Federal Reserve for a
28-day loan of as-yet undetermined size.
Other financial stocks took a beating. Lehman Brothers Holdings fell 15%. Citigroup slid 6.1%, at one point
reaching its lowest intraday price since December 1998. American Express ended down 4%, and J.P.
Morgan, Bank of America and American International Group each declined more than 3%.
For much of the past year, investors have demonstrated an aversion to potentially risky assets, shunning
stocks, "junk" bonds and mortgage debt. In the past few weeks, they have even fled seemingly safe products
such as municipal bonds or debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored
enterprises.
Worried about a housing meltdown and an economic downturn, investors instead are flocking to U.S.
Treasurys and gold, customary havens.
Bear Stearns's troubles threaten to push the markets' concerns to a new level. Earlier in the week, executives
at Bear had said that the firm's financial health was OK. Friday, Bear said the situation has deteriorated
rapidly. So, investors and traders are now wondering if that means the financial markets are so hobbled that
even a big brokerage can turn desperate in a matter of hours.
Perhaps most important, does the move by Bear suggest the markets are closer to their nightmare scenario,
in which doubts about financial companies that serve as counterparties in billions of dollars of transactions
suddenly freeze trading, or force investors to unwind existing trades, causing a domino effect that cripples the
markets?
The trickiest problem for central bankers and Wall Street executives to solve has been a lack of confidence
among firms in one another's ability to make good on their trades, which has led to a seizing up in the market
for some securities held even by players who have sufficient collateral in hand.
On a conference call, Bear Stearns painted itself as a victim to this process. "A lot of people, it seemed,
wanted to protect themselves from the possibility of rumors being true and act later to learn the facts," Bear
Chief Executive Alan Schwartz said.
The past week's market losses are disconcerting because the Federal Reserve has taken a series of
significant steps in recent months to head off the building financial crisis. Early in the week, the Fed and other
central banks initiated a plan to add as much as $200 billion to the credit markets and let financial firms use a
broader range of securities as collateral for borrowing. It was initially met with enthusiasm. Stocks soared.
In the coming week, the Fed is expected to cut short-term rates by at least half a percentage point, which
some on Wall Street want, to lower borrowing costs throughout the economy and spur growth.
But the good feelings in anticipation of these moves dissipated with Bear's sudden news.

"The market thinks this is just one of many shoes to drop," said Gregory Peters, head of credit strategy at
Morgan Stanley. "Investors still have broader concerns, especially about how quickly this can all deteriorate."
Some traders also took note that Bear turned to J.P. Morgan and the Fed, rather than another investor such
as the deep-pocketed arms of foreign governments that have been buying stakes in financial companies in
the past year. That might suggest that these sovereign-wealth funds are tapped out or unwilling to risk more
losses from recent forays into financial shares.
Some see a potential silver lining in all the hand-wringing by investors. David Rosenberg, a Merrill Lynch
economist, argues that the economy's problems now are "mainstream thought and priced in, or at least
largely priced in" stock and bond prices.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.1%, or 27.34 points, at 1288.14, with all of its sectors posting
declines, led by a 3.6% plunge in the broad measure's financial components as a group. The
technology-stock-focused Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.3%, or 51.12 points, at 2212.49.
Other financial markets gyrated. The 10-year Treasury note shot up 30/32, or $9.375 per $1,000 invested, to
push down the yield to 3.423%. The two-year note gained 12/32 to yield 1.424%.
The dollar fell below 100 yen to trade at 99.23 yen, down from 100.78 yen late Thursday in New York. The
euro was up to $1.5671 from $1.5609 late Thursday.
Gold futures crossed above the $1,000 mark before finishing shy of that, up $5.80, or 0.6%, at a record
close $998.10 an ounce. Crude-oil futures fell 12 cents, or 0.1%, to $110.21 a barrel in New York.

Fifteen years ago, Glenn and Monet Rubin of Portland, Ore., visited a wine shop in New Mexico and bought a
bottle of La Bomba Grande, a red blend from a nearby winery with the most amazing label: It features a large
mushroom cloud. The wine was bottled in 1993 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, which developed the atom bomb. On Saturday night, Feb. 23, the Rubins
finally opened the wine. How was it? "Definitely not a bomb," they reported, "but not exactly grande, either."
On the same night, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Dave Thomas surprised his wife, Amy, by opening a 1992 Robert
Mondavi Pinot Noir that she had given him when they were dating over a decade ago, and had long since
forgotten. And in Bethesda, Md., Brook Manville's Argentine father-in-law opened his last, cherished bottle of
1974 Chateau Montchenot from Argentina. "The occasion allowed Fred, who is now in his 80s, to reflect upon
the friend who brought the wine to the U.S. and many others who shared the cost of the imported case, and a
broader set of reflections on the camaraderie of a large multinational corporation in the 1980s. His
granddaughter, as well as other members of the family, listened lovingly, and the conversation moved on to
other memories. As his daughter pointed out at the end, 'All flowed from this simple old bottle of wine.'"
And that, really, is what it's all about. Feb. 23 was Open That Bottle Night 9, when all of us, world-wide, finally
drank the wine that was too precious to open and celebrated the memories that came with it. OTBN was
bigger than ever this year, with newspapers and restaurants around North America and bloggers around the
world picking up the ball and creating their own OTBN communities. Celebrants opened two bottles of 1900
Madeira (one in Kentucky and one in Connecticut) as well as two bottles of 1961 Lafite Rothschild (in Atlanta
and Big Sky, Mont.) and a 10-year-old homemade pear wine (in Oregon). "We opened a bottle of 1982 Dom
Perignon that I had been given 16 years ago on my 50th birthday," wrote Pope Hoffman of Dover, Mass.
"There have been many special occasions since then, including my daughter's wedding, the birth of my two
granddaughters, my son's engagement and my own wedding, but I never got around to opening this bottle."
He added: "The Champagne was fabulous (thank goodness!)."
In Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Ensign Kristine Chou's family flew in from California and Virginia to welcome her
after a six-month deployment aboard a frigate -- and brought along three special wines to celebrate OTBN
together. Rebecca Lommel of Mansfield, Texas, finally opened a bottle of wine from Finland she acquired
during a trip there in 1987. "We had traded a reindeer farmer a pint of Jim Beam for it," she said. "It was
pronounced 'sweet radiator fluid' by general consensus." Jon and Vicki Hutcheson of Springfield, Mo., opened
a bottle of red wine from Jordan. "What do you do with a bottle that says 'Wine of the Holy Land?'" they
asked. The wine, by the way, was "simple, but drinkable."
As we read hundreds of OTBN letters, we were struck by how few people mentioned current events -- very
little talk of politics, Fed rate cuts or war. In fact, it was very much the opposite: While we seem so often to be
fixated on the future -- on retirement, the next promotion or the upcoming tuition payment -- on OTBN there
was a sense of looking inward and back in celebration, a feeling that we had triumphed over many things to
get to this night, that we had survived. In so many cases, the bottles themselves were a symbol of that. Time
and again, readers compared themselves, their friendships or their marriages to the amazing longevity of
their bottles. After dinner in St. Louis Park, Minn., Greg and Stephanie Loeschke's guests "shared some
home videos of our three families when our 16-year-olds were 3 or 4. Wonderful reminiscing. Michael Wong
and Shelley Hauge brought a beautiful fruit torte for dessert and a small bottle of Moet & Chandon
Champagne they served at their wedding in 1986. Although this last little bottle of Champagne had lost most
of its fizz (some of us, too, we're afraid), it also was remarkably still drinkable."
Judith Trepanowski Andersson and her husband, Lars, opened a 1982 Chateau Haut-Brion in Clarks Summit,
Pa., to celebrate the year they met -- although they parted ways, married other people and didn't marry each
other until last November. How was the wine? "Smoky, mysterious -- a wonderful surprise," she wrote.

Anyone who believes that Americans are in a pessimistic or sour mood should read our mail. More than ever,
OTBN celebrants were ready to party. The meals were fancier and more elaborate than in the past. Beef was
the dish of choice, served in just about every form. There was filet steak, Provencal daube of beef, beef filet
with a veal/wine reduction, braised short ribs, Grandmother's beef goulash, thinly sliced rare roast beef,
Delmonico steaks, filet mignon, standing rib roast, oven-roasted cube steak in onion gravy, and porterhouse
steaks with a mushroom, shallot and red-wine reduction.
It was a year of multicourse indulgence. Hugh and Francine Thompson of Edina, Minn., treated their guests
to a feast beginning with foie gras and 1998 Dom Perignon and then smoked salmon and avocado on endive
leaves with a 1997 Chablis. John MacLennan of Valparaiso, Ind., asked Chef Nicole Bissonnette of Bistro
157 to prepare a seven-course tasting menu for eight; she paired red wine-braised oxtail with a 1995 Barolo.
Bob and Joanne Levite of Coral Gables, Fla., had 60 guests, a caterer and a jazz guitarist. As Dave and Marji
Osborn of Longboat Key, Fla., who celebrated with four other couples, put it: "We began the evening at 7
p.m. and started turning off the lights and extinguishing candles at 1:30 a.m. In the morning, we discovered
11 wine corks and two Cava corks. How did they get there?"
In Israel, Ken Bob of Plainview, N.Y., celebrated OTBN with old friends on a kibbutz where he used to live.
They conducted a tasting of Israeli wines. In Lausanne, Switzerland, Marie and Bill Fischer and several
friends opened a number of wines, including one that a guest bought in 1976, "a 1975 Chasselas from a
vineyard that we can see from our dining-room window."
The most-opened wines this year were high-end California Cabernets and first-growth Bordeaux. The single
most-opened labels were Silver Oak and Opus One from California. Just behind them was Chateau Latour,
including a magnum of 1989 that was shipped air express from Painswick, England, to a different party in
Longboat Key, Fla., for OTBN. Some of the most special wines, however, did not have that kind of pedigree.
Theresa Klisz of Falls Church, Va., opened bottles with friends including a blueberry wine made by her late
father, a retired engineer who planted 1,500 blueberry plants for what became the Klisz Blueberry Farm near
Danville, Ky. Her dad died in 2004. "Dad wasn't certain that he'd be able to make a drinkable wine from
blueberries," she said. "He'd made wine from grapes for decades with great success, so he was looking for a
challenge. His experiment was quite successful and he was very proud, grinning like a Cheshire cat when he
offered a taste. The vintage is unknown -- probably early-1990s -- and the taste quite sweet. The bottle had
moved with me at least three times and after Dad died, it became a treasure. There was no better way to
honor him than by sharing this bottle with the family I've built living here."
Many of the wines were very old and sometimes not well-cared-for, so celebrants often opened them with
trepidation. As Rae and Norm Leaper of San Francisco said of their 1934 Vina Tondonia from Spain: "We
long ago assumed it had slid gracefully from 'too special' to brackish." It turned out to be "reasonably good."
In our advance article about OTBN, we told the story of "Nancy," a very old bottle of Chardonnay that Carolyn
Pearce of Kerrville, Texas, had been keeping since it was served at a tribute to Nancy Reagan in 1988. How
was it? "It was drinkable and had aged gracefully, just like the former first lady," Dr. Pearce wrote. And there
was this story, from Michael and Darlene Murrah of Columbia, Mo.
For OTBN, we opened a half bottle of 1993 Chateau Puy Castera Haut-Medoc that we discovered in a little
wine shop in Paris. We were there in 2003 celebrating our 15th wedding anniversary when we found this little
beauty and took a single bottle back to our room to try. It was so remarkably delicious that we went back the
next day and bought the seven remaining bottles. During our three weeks in France, these bottles
accompanied our picnic lunches to the plaza in front of Notre Dame, the Grand Canal at Versailles and
Monet's Garden at Giverny. When it was time for our return home, this one bottle, which was 10 years old
when we bought it, remained to make the journey with us. When we opened it, the bouquet and first taste
hinted that its time may have passed. But as we proceeded with our filets and the reliving of our French
adventures, a remarkable event occurred: This beautiful Bordeaux apparently also remembered Paris, and
proceeded to relive its former glory.
Still, it's inevitable that whenever so many old, too-long-cherished bottles are opened, some will disappoint.
Jan Cwalina of Aiken, S.C., opened a 1978 Concannon Cabernet Sauvignon bought at the winery in 1983.
"There was a chemical bouquet and a stale-air smell somewhat like air let out of an old tire or basketball. It
came across a bit harsh, syrupy and worrisome. Even after it aired for quite a while, it was not the least
drinkable." Cathy Gonzalez of Islip, N.Y., opened a 1989 Pindar Mythology that she'd bought during family
vacations on Long Island, N.Y. "I'm glad that our kids have matured a lot better than that wine," she wrote.
In fact, children were very much a part of the festivities this year. We began OTBN nine years ago and often
printed stories from people who couldn't have much of an OTBN celebration because of the kids. But
longtime celebrants this year noted with some amazement, again and again, that the kids had grown up. "For
our OTBN my wife and I were joined by our 26-year-old son, who lives in Redmond, Wash.," wrote Larry
Saltzman of Sacramento. "I chose a bottle of 1984 Sycamore Creek Central Coast Cabernet. This winery is in
Morgan Hill, Calif., and we would visit it each summer as we drove with our children to a camp in Big Sur.
When I refreshed my son's memory about why I chose this bottle, he remembered immediately his visits with

the owner's children and thought it was quite the perfect choice for the evening. I had been holding on to this
particular bottle, waiting for the right time to open it. Year after year I waited and was so pleased that we
opened it and shared it with our now-old-enough-to-drink-legally son."
Other kids, however, still have a way to go. Wrote Amber Coughlin of Fort Wayne, Ind:
My husband and I purchased a bottle of wine last year on our anniversary trip from a local winery and saved it
for OTBN 2008. In January we realized that we had booked a trip to Chicago with our children on the same
weekend as OTBN. So, in order to make them feel included, we also purchased a bottle of sparkling
lemonade. Sitting in a hotel room in Chicago, my husband gave a toast and the kids loved it. Even our
15-year-old thought we were fun, which lately is a miracle. The kids are already planning their bottle for
OTBN 2009.
While we're pleased and flattered that OTBN has become a kind of national wine day, it's important to
remember the real point: Open those special wines year-round. Don't wait for a special occasion. Make the
wines themselves the special occasion. As Ronald C. Strickler of Grosse Pointe Park, Mich., put it: "Thanks
for helping another foolish Silas Marner understand that gold coins are to be spent and wine is to be
opened."
Trust Laura and Chris Morris of Richmond, Va., on this: Wine, and the memories it invokes, can be more
powerful than you think. The Morrises met during college at a Christian retreat more than 15 years ago, got
married, had two children and both became teachers. They have been celebrating OTBN for years. "Last
June, we picked up a 2005 Sangiovese from Island Winery on Hilton Head, S.C., while on our annual family
vacation there. Setting it aside for OTBN, we figured it would be the perfect bottle to open on a cold February
evening to reminisce over about all our wonderful summer memories," Mr. Morris wrote. "Since then,
however, my wife and I have separated. While still very much in love, we have had a number of issues in our
marriage and we simply were not sure if they could be worked through. On OTBN, almost on the spur of the
moment, we decided to get together and drink our bottle regardless. We began talking. And laughing. And
crying. We ended up having a several-hour discussion of us -- past, present and future. And over our one
bottle of red, we both decided that nothing could be more important than working together to heal our broken
relationship."
The Morrises have decided to seek counseling. "We've grown through our mistakes," Mrs. Morris told us.
Although they are still living apart, "our kids can tell something is different," Mr. Morris said, "because we're all
eating together since that night." He added: "We would venture to say that our OTBN was better than
anybody's in the world."

What You Drank . . .
The wines enjoyed on Open That Bottle Night spanned more than a century and included at least one wine
from every vintage since 1969. Here is a sampling (for more, go to wsj.com/otbn).
1961 Chateau Lafite Rothschild (France). "The Lafite was the surprise of the evening as it continued to
develop and its fruit never diminished over a four- or five-hour period." Bill and Jennifer Reed, Big Sky, Mont.
1964 Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon (California). "The original price was $2.25. The bouquet was the most
interesting part, an almost rose-like fragrance. The color was quite good. The wine was a bit thin, but there
was still some fruit and the tannins were soft and unobtrusive. It was certainly not a great wine, but it was a
pleasure to learn that after 44 years it was still capable of providing some pleasure." Frank Cavignac, San
Diego
1985 Franciscan Cabernet Sauvignon (California). "Lithe and supple, not a sharp edge to be found.
Remarkable balance." Peter Vangsness, East Longmeadow, Mass.
1992 Beringer Merlot "Howell Mountain, Bancroft Ranch" (California). "Like velvet on the palate, with lovely
structure and plenty of life in it." John Wernette, Naples, Fla.
2003 and 2004 Chrysalis Viognier (Virginia). "Vastly different: like subtle tropical potpourri in the '03 and like
fresh-cut pineapple soaked in vanilla in the '04." Patricia Valas and Walter Rachele, Finksburg, Md.

Our OTBN
WHAT WINE did we drink on Open That Bottle Night? This year, we let readers vote on which of five precious
bottles we'd open. The final vote was very close, especially among the top two, so we decided to open both of
them.
The winner, by a neck, was Roederer Estate L'Ermitage Brut 1991. Years ago, we wrote a column about what
wines were served at state dinners and discovered that this wine was actually sweetened for the Clinton
White House. We tried one bottle at that time, but could never stand to open the second. It was still bubbly
and nicely nutty, though, we must say, a bit too sweet for our taste, especially as it opened and warmed.
The second-place wine was a "Burgundy" from Pastori Wines in California, a wine we bought years ago and
had signed by Edith Pastori. It's symbolic of so many of the wines enjoyed on Open That Bottle Night: bottles
that so many of us buy on trips to wineries and never open. This simple wine was never meant to age, but
held up quite well with Dottie's duck. It was light-colored and brown-tinged, but still had some tangy, charming
fruit. We used both wines to toast Dottie's mom, Grandma Dot, who had a stroke the day after Open That
Bottle Night last year and died a few days later. So we celebrated memories of a truly special loved one with
cherished wines with their own unique stories.

Japan Economy Quakes Anew As Yen Soars Against Dollar --- Political Gridlock Hits Tokyo Stocks; An Upside for U.S.?
Japan Economy Quakes Anew As Yen Soars Against Dollar --- Political Gridlock Hits Tokyo Stocks;
An Upside for U.S.?

The dollar's dive deepened, as it touched a low against the euro and, for the first time since late 1995, briefly
bought fewer than 100 yen.
The weak greenback creates a host of problems world-wide, starting in Japan, where a stronger yen
threatens exporters and makes a slowdown or recession more likely in the world's No. 2 economy.
Japan is again suffering from a broad sense of drift, after momentum built up under charismatic Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi, in power from 2001 to 2006. Parliament, split between the two big parties since
last year, is in gridlock, leaving the country without a central-bank governor less than a week before the
incumbent steps down. The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average is down 19% for the year.
Despite the blow it delivers to Japan, the dollar's steep decline is welcomed by some economists, who say it
could help the U.S. reduce its huge trade deficit and thereby shake its $2 billion-a-day addiction to foreign
capital. "I think a weaker dollar, if it doesn't spiral out of control, is part of the solution here," said Barry
Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley.
Prof. Eichengreen's "if" is a big one. The fear now is that the dollar's decline could accelerate and that could
shake already rattled markets. Gold, a refuge in times of uncertainty, briefly topped $1,000 an ounce
yesterday in one contract, while the benchmark crude-oil futures price topped $110 a barrel.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is facing both a weakening economy and inflationary pressures brought on by
higher oil and commodity prices. If the Fed cuts rates sharply even as the European Central Bank and Bank
of Japan are holding them steady, that could intensify downward pressure on the dollar, and add to anxiety
about U.S. inflation. The dollar tends to weaken as U.S. rates fall relative to overseas rates, because the
other currencies become more attractive to investors.
For Japan, the reverberations from a weak dollar come at a particularly vulnerable time. Despite six years of
modest growth, consumers still haven't opened up their purse strings. The Bank of Japan's benchmark
interest rate remains at 0.5%.
In Mr. Koizumi's final year, it seemed possible that Japan would finally escape the specter of deflation --
constantly falling prices -- that had acted as a brake on growth since the late 1990s. The Bank of Japan
hoped to raise interest rates to a more normal level, to give itself more flexibility.
Instead, it is stuck: It can't raise rates when the economy's outlook is weak, nor can it lower them much. More
creative steps by the BOJ are off the table until it gets a permanent new governor.
Investors' waning confidence in Japan has sent stocks sinking. The Nikkei has fallen more sharply than the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, even though cautious Japanese banks generally sidestepped major damage
from the U.S. housing mess. The Nikkei fell 3.3% yesterday, dragging down Asian shares, and the index
stands at less than one-third of its peak in 1989.
"Unless drastic restructuring is done, the economy will wither in the medium- to long-term," said Eisuke
Sakakibara, a Waseda University professor and former finance ministry official who recently published a book
titled "Japan Goes to the Dogs."
Japan is particularly vulnerable to currency fluctuations because its economy depends so heavily on exports
for growth. Japan's economy grew by 2.1% last year, and more than half of that growth came from exports. A
weaker dollar makes Japanese companies' products more expensive overseas, while reducing the value of
their dollar-based earnings when converted into yen.

If the dollar continues to fall, "we now face a considerably high possibility of having a situation that can be
defined as a recession," said Hiroshi Shiraishi, a Lehman Brothers economist in Tokyo.
Toyota Motor Corp. sees annual operating profit cut by 35 billion yen, or about $350 million, every time the
dollar's value slips by one yen. With the dollar having lost more than 10 yen since the end of last year, that
suggests Toyota's profits could take a several-billion-dollar hit. The car maker's president, Katsuaki
Watanabe, told reporters yesterday it isn't clear if the company could maintain profit growth if the dollar
continues to slide, despite cost cuts and other possible measures.
The last time Japan faced a seriously weak dollar was in 1994-95, when the dollar stayed below the 100-yen
level for a year and a half, and reached a historic low of 79.75 yen. Japan fought back by intervening heavily
in the currency markets to depress the value of the yen and boosted government spending to help weaker
companies.
This time, Japan doesn't have as many tools. Its big budget deficit makes a stimulus package more difficult.
Intervention -- which Tokyo also tried in 2004 during a bout of yen strength -- would fly in the face of efforts by
the U.S. and other nations to let markets decide currency values.
The dollar's decline isn't all bad news for the Japanese economy, especially for consumers who can expect
bargains on imported handbags and the like. However, food, raw materials and energy make up a big portion
of Japan's imports, and prices of these goods are going up, even accounting for the cheaper dollar.
"Savings from the strong yen in no way offset the damage from the rise in commodity prices," says a
spokesman for Nissin Food Products Co., a big instant-noodle maker and a major importer of wheat.
Over the past year, wheat prices have more than doubled. Nissin expects higher ingredient costs to shave at
least three billion yen off its earnings for the year ending March 31. It anticipates "far greater losses" going
forward, the spokesman says.
In Europe, too, policy makers and businesspeople are generally focusing on the downside of the dollar's slide
and its effect on exports. A February survey of purchasing managers in the countries using the euro found
that the growth in new export orders rose at the weakest pace for 33 months.
Early in the life of the unified European currency, one euro bought less than a dollar. At yesterday's record
level, a euro bought more than $1.56. Since the start of 2002, the dollar has lost 25% of its value measured
against a trade-weighted basket of 26 currencies.
The dollar's slide is likely to continue, say investors, unless Europe's economy shows significant signs of
weakening or governments intervene in currency markets. The dollar's fall is "still orderly, but it's becoming a
bit worrisome," said Stephen Jen, global head of currency research at Morgan Stanley. "Speculators are
deploying capital and leverage to capitalize on the vulnerabilities of the U.S. dollar."
The good news is that currency markets remain highly traded, with none of the freezing-up that has
characterized large swaths of the credit markets. Contracts used to protect against swings in currency values
indicate that investors are worried about near-term volatility, but not nearly as much as they were during
earlier bouts of instability in 1998 and 2000, says Greg Anderson, a foreign-exchange specialist at Dutch
bank ABN Amro.
Berkeley's Prof. Eichengreen says "it would have been nicer" if the dollar's fall wasn't accompanied by
"everything coming with a crash all at once." But he still sees a bright side for the U.S.: "When consumer
demand is weak and investment demand is weak, the one remaining source of demand is export demand,
and that's what a weak dollar stimulates."

Gold hit a grand, at least a key contract did -- but like oil's first run at the century mark, it didn't sit there long.
The most-active futures contract on the metal hit an intraday high of $1,001.50 a troy ounce yesterday as the
dollar plumbed fresh lows, inflation fears ran wilder, oil soared and other investments continued to hold
lackluster appeal.
The contract, for April delivery, closed at $993.80 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
The benchmark, nearby-month contract for March, no longer trading heavily, never broke the $1,000 mark
and settled up $13.50, or 1.4%, at $992.30 -- a Comex settlement high. Gold is up 19% for the year to date.
The latest sprint started about three weeks ago amid dour news about job losses, the deepening funk in U.S.
real-estate and credit markets, and the Federal Reserve's determination to fight these economic ills before
tackling rising inflation.
An added push is coming from oil, which has soared this year despite recession fears, closing up 41 cents, or
0.4%, yesterday at $110.33 a barrel, a Nymex record. As with gold, investors are snapping up oil as its value,
denominated in dollars, moves up as the greenback keeps sinking. (For more on oil, please see page C6.)
The gold market hasn't been this heated since 1980. Then, as now, inflation was rearing its head -- at nearly
14%, compared with today's rate of 4.3% -- and the dollar was diving in value and losing its appeal as a world
currency. Prices for an array of energy and industrial commodities were hitting records, and investors were
pulling out of traditional markets to hoard precious metals.
"In 1980, you had extremely hostile economic, political and financial conditions. You have them again today.
In some cases, the conditions are worse today," said Jeffrey Christian, managing director at CPM Group, a
precious-metals-research firm that publishes the widely watched Gold Yearbook, an annual report on the
gold market.
The U.S. budget deficit and debt have become much larger since then. Also, the U.S. dollar turned around in
1980 and began a long period of strengthening. Now, many investors are more pessimistic about the
American currency, since the U.S. already may be in a recession and the Federal Reserve is one of the only
major central banks cutting interest rates. Yesterday, the dollar fell below the psychologically key 100-yen
mark in intraday trading for the first time since 1995.
In other ways, today's economy is more benign. Inflation, for one, is far lower.
But many investors believe comparatively lower inflation is a key reason why gold and silver have a lot of
room to run. Gold is still less than half its inflation-adjusted peak on Jan. 21, 1980, of $2,239.67. Silver's
nominal peak of $48.70 in January 1980 still isn't close to being breached and amounts to $132.13 when
adjusted for inflation; it closed yesterday at $20.339 a troy ounce, up 42.8 cents, or 2.2%.

Jim Estipona, a 45-year-old software-services entrepreneur in Iowa, made his inaugural gold purchase last
week. "I looked at gold when it was close to $900 and thought it might be too late. Then, it went above $900,
then above $950. I said, 'I'd better do something.' I bought my gold at $969." He now has roughly 10% of his
assets in gold.
Through the centuries, this untarnishable metal has had a mesmerizing appeal as a show of prosperity,
display of beauty and sign of greed.
Europe long used gold as a basis for its monetary systems. In the 1800s, Britain, followed by Europe and
later the U.S., took additional steps to peg their paper currencies to a set amount of gold. Central banks
began abandoning the gold standard in the 1930s, in part because countries in economic crisis experienced
runs on their treasuries to convert paper to gold. In 1971, President Nixon abandoned a fixed gold-dollar
conversion price and let the dollar float freely against other currencies. Gold's 1970s bull run was followed by
a crash in 1980.
Because gold has few industrial uses -- small amounts are consumed in dentistry and electronics -- it
occupies a peculiar place in today's commodities bull market. Unlike copper or oil, almost all gold that has
ever been mined is still around, in jewelry or bars stored in vaults.
Total available supply of gold rose 6.2% in 2007, according to CPM's Gold Yearbook. Although new mine
output is dropping, high prices led more people to sell scrap such as old jewelry. Central banks also have
been selling large volumes of gold, boosting supply.
Yet investors are once again grasping at gold's value in record numbers, ignoring predictions of another
crash. Wall Street has created ever-easier gold-investment tools such as exchange-traded funds; such funds
trade like a stock, and shares are backed by physical gold.
Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, a brokerage in Darien, Conn., that advises individual investors
on non-U.S. and non-dollar-denominated investments, said he sells about $10 million of gold coins a month,
compared with a couple hundred thousand dollars monthly in 2002 and 2003. He also said he is doing a brisk
business helping investors purchase available gold at the Perth Mint in Australia.
Jon Nadler, a gold analyst with Kitco Bullion Dealers Montreal, which runs a gold-information Web site,
defected from communist-controlled Romania in 1972 with gold coins sewn into his clothing. His stash
allowed him to pay for his U.S. education.
But he said gold bugs who hoard gold to the exclusion of other assets, predicting prices will reach $4,000 or
$5,000 an ounce, are missing the point. The financial system would have to break down for gold to rise to
those levels. It would "mean complete ruin for everything you own," he said, in which case "you'd better invest
in lead, for bullets."

Carbon King: Economist Strikes Gold In Climate-Change Fight --- Pollution Market Seen as Test for U.S.; One 'Surreal' Fall
Carbon King: Economist Strikes Gold In Climate-Change Fight --- Pollution Market Seen as Test for

LONDON -- The planet is getting warmer. Richard Sandor, a 66-year-old economist, is getting wealthier.
His company, London-based Climate Exchange PLC, has carved out a key role in Europe's booming trade in
"carbon permits" -- essentially, buying and selling the right to pollute. Since 2005, the European Union has
required major polluters to either cut the amount of carbon dioxide they spew, or buy pollution credits in the
open market.
A big chunk of the action occurs on an exchange founded by Mr. Sandor, a one-time Berkeley professor who
has morphed into a gregarious climate-change entrepreneur.
He's among the most successful investors trying to profit from rising environmental awareness, whether by
speculating in energy commodities or launching wind-power companies. Last year, the total value of carbon
permits changing hands -- whether on public exchanges or in private, off-market transactions, where most still
occur -- nearly doubled to 40 billion euros, or about $60 billion, according to Oslo-based Point Carbon, a
market research firm.
Yesterday, Climate Exchange's stock jumped 16% after the firm reported a tripling in 2007 revenue to GBP
13.6 million, or about $27 million. That gives the company, which handles about 90% of the trading on carbon
exchanges, a market capitalization of roughly $1.31 billion. Mr. Sandor's 20% stake is worth more than $260
million on paper.
It's an unusual mix of markets theory and environmentalism. "The right wing always suspects you of being a
tree-hugging environmentalist and the left wing accuses you of being a money-grubbing capitalist," says Mr.
Sandor, who back in the 1990s developed a markets-based system to cut down on pollutants causing acid
rain.
Carbon trading is drawing intense interest from rivals. In January, NYSE Euronext launched its own carbon
exchange, bringing the total number to at least eight globally. Citing "huge growth potential," the New York
Mercantile Exchange plans to enter the field in this year's first quarter.
The next big battlefield will be in the U.S., where Congress is currently debating setting up a system for
regulating greenhouse-gas emissions. Lawmakers are considering a system like the one created by the 1997
Kyoto Protocol, a global United Nations-sponsored accord that set emissions-cutting targets for the 175
nations that ratified it. Europe's program was an early test run of the Kyoto Protocol, whose emission
restrictions began hitting industry this year.
The U.S. hasn't ratified Kyoto. But all three leading Democratic and Republican presidential candidates say
they want the U.S. to do more to fight climate change, and would likely set up a carbon-trading program.
Carbon permits are traded much like physical commodities -- gold, oil or pork bellies. Each
government-issued permit grants its holder permission to emit a ton of carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon
Exchange makes money by taking a commission on each trade and by charging membership fees.
So-called "cap and trade" programs like Europe's are intended to give polluters a financial incentive to clean
up their act. Governments set emissions caps, and companies that beat them can trade their pollution credits
to other firms willing to pay to pollute. Over time, the caps are lowered, making it costlier to choose to keep
polluting.
About 70% of carbon permits still change hands off the market, in private transactions between companies or
financial institutions. Trading on an exchange is often more efficient than trying to find a buyer or seller alone.
But for bigger trades, many companies and banks still prefer to do private deals so they don't tip off
competitors or cause drastic swings in the still-nascent market.

--- Page 101 ---

Still, Mr. Sandor's exchange is a key piece of the financial infrastructure underpinning this system. It gives
these companies -- mainly industrial giants like power generators, steel mills and cement makers -- a clear
idea of the market price of carbon both currently and well off into the future. It also lets hedge funds and other
investors speculate in the permits just as they would in other assets, such as gold or stock.
Some economists argue for taxing polluters instead, including Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz,
and former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw. A carbon tax, they
say, would be more transparent and less vulnerable to lobbying by industries trying to win higher caps for
themselves.
Last month, a report by the Congressional Budget Office said a carbon tax could achieve the same emissions
reductions "at a fraction of the cost" of a cap-and-trade system. The savings stem partly from the fact that
such a policy is simpler to implement than building a carbon market.
Other criticisms of carbon trading focus on the financial wizards -- such as Mr. Sandor -- who design and run
the markets. "Financial resources are being redistributed to the banks and traders rather than paying for
technological innovations to cut emissions," says Carlo Stagnaro of the Italy-based economic think tank
Istituto Bruno Leoni, who just published a paper on the European Union's emissions-trading system.
Europe's own system shows evidence of these strains. Governments there initially yielded to industry
pressure and allocated too many carbon permits, giving companies little immediate incentive to cut their
emissions.
The system, which has been up and running only three years in Europe, hasn't yet produced big reductions in
emissions. But carbon trading has boomed -- handing a tidy profit to banks, traders and exchanges such as
the one founded by Mr. Sandor. Power companies and heavy industry trade carbon continuously to try to
make money off price fluctuations and to hedge their future risk, as well as to comply with Kyoto rules.
Robert Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, agrees
Europe's carbon market isn't perfect, but defends the role of financiers. "The only way we can fight climate
change is if there is an opportunity for businesses and individuals to make a fortune off of it," he said.
That's what Mr. Sandor has done. "I am a capitalist who runs a business and has to deliver value to
shareholders," he said during a recent interview at the Ritz Hotel in London. "I consider myself to be an
environmentalist, but I divorce those sentiments from my day job."
Mr. Sandor, a dapper professor in close-cropped hair and tailored suits, started his career teaching
economics and finance at the University of California, Berkeley, where he developed ideas for trading
intangible things, like interest rates or mortgages, on a market.
He later made a name for himself at the Chicago Board of Trade where he did leading work on developing
financial futures markets in the U.S. Today he lives in Chicago with his wife, a painter, in a home where the
walls are covered with his extensive collection of 20th-century photography.
He first envisioned a carbon market long before many people had heard of global warming. In 1992 at the
United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, he presented an academic paper on how markets might be
used to reduce carbon emissions.
Of the conference, Mr. Sandor recalls: "There was more tie-dye there than at a Grateful Dead concert. It felt
like a movement." Indeed, the event laid the groundwork for what eventually became the 1997 Kyoto
Protocol.
It was in Brazil, eating shrimp and sipping a caipirinha on the beach, that Mr. Sandor says he first thought
about setting up his own carbon market. "I know how to pioneer new markets," he recalls thinking. "I've done
it before."
In the late 1990s he finally got his chance -- or so he thought. At that time, countries around the world started
signing on to the Kyoto Protocol.
He assumed the U.S. would sign on, too, so he founded the Chicago Climate Exchange in anticipation of a
U.S. carbon-trading boom. However, soon after taking office, the Bush administration declined to ratify Kyoto,
arguing it would hurt U.S. companies' competitiveness because developing countries like China and India
weren't required to curb emissions.
Mr. Sandor's dream fizzled. With no treaty, U.S. companies wouldn't be required to cut carbon emissions. He
was left with a company that basically had little reason to exist.

--- Page 102 ---
Page 102 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
But rather than dumping it, he decided to convert the Chicago Climate Exchange into a system that
companies could join to voluntarily reduce their emissions.
By 2003, he teamed up with a friend in London, insurance executive Neil Eckert, to take everything learned in
the U.S. experiment and apply it in Europe, which was then just gearing up its own trading system. So they
set up a separate carbon-trading market in London, the European Climate Exchange. Mr. Eckert later
became its chief executive, a position he holds today.
Mr. Sandor had an ace up his sleeve: He sat on the board of IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, which
operates Europe's leading energy exchange, trading oil, gas and electricity. ICE agreed to host Mr. Sandor's
new European Climate Exchange on its system as part of an undisclosed revenue-sharing agreement.
That deal was an important part of Climate Exchange's success at beating rival markets: The ICE affiliation
instantly put his exchange in front of Europe's commodity traders.
Trading began at the start of 2005. It wasn't smooth sailing. On May 12, 2006, EU regulators shocked the
market by posting data showing that national governments had allocated far too many permits. For example,
Sweden's actual emissions were around 10% below the number of emissions allowances the government
handed out. The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and France confronted a similar situation.
Abyd Karmali, head of Merrill Lynch's carbon-trading business, was in Cologne, Germany, that day attending
a carbon-market conference. People were huddled around computers, watching prices fall like a rock.
"It was surreal," said Mr. Karmali. "People were frantically calling their trading desks."
In three short days, the price of carbon collapsed 60%. Mr. Karmali called those events "a litmus test" for Mr.
Sandor's exchange. "It showed us that the infrastructure worked and that the market could withstand future
shocks."
Learning from their mistake, European regulators later tightened the emissions caps.
Europe's carbon market continued to grow, and with it, Mr. Sandor's company. In trading yesterday on
London's AIM, the 16% jump in its share price, to 1,441 pence ($28.89), followed the company's report that
volumes grew on both the London and Chicago exchanges. But profitability is still elusive: The firm posted a
net loss of GBP 4.1 million last year, although that was an improvement over the year-earlier loss of GBP
10.5 million.
Despite its role in Europe's fast-growing carbon market, Mr. Sandor's firm is still a minnow in the
shark-infested waters of commodities trading. It's run from a small office in the financial district of London
where a dozen or so employees work in a single big room lined with tattered carpet.
There's no traditional trading floor -- the actual trading is done entirely online. Commodities traders at banks
world-wide have the exchange's software on their screens and can buy and sell carbon permits at the click of
a mouse button.
Companies that must comply with Kyoto rules can also buy and sell on the exchange. For instance, say, a
German utility with excess credits would be free to sell them to a Japanese steelmaker firm that wanted them.
Trades are cleared by the exchange, which acts as a kind of guarantor as well, cutting down on credit risk for
the buyer and seller.
A 2008 permit entitling the bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide is currently trading just under 22 euros,
up from 17 euros or so a year earlier.
At the end of each year, regulated companies must hold permits representing their total emissions over that
period. A fairly typical coal-fired power plant might emit anywhere from five million to 15 million tons of carbon
dioxide a year, depending on its size and other variables.
The risk for Mr. Sandor is that his firm will get beaten by much bigger rivals when the U.S. sets up its own
system for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Analysts estimate that the U.S. carbon market would be about
three times the size of Europe's, a windfall that is sure to attract rivals.
"We're going to keep succeeding," Mr. Sandor says. Among other things, he and Mr. Eckert are trying to stay
one step ahead by trying to gain footing in other new markets.
Last December they signed a memorandum of understanding with China National Petroleum Corp. to explore
setting up an emissions-trading platform in Beijing. And in India the firm is exploring establishing a voluntary
market like the one originally set up in Chicago a decade ago.
"We view ambiguity as an opportunity, not as a deterrent," Mr. Sandor says.

Partners Score
Big in 'Off' Year
---
Blackstone Founders Reap
Huge Cash Distributions
Despite Weak Earnings
Don't feel bad for Blackstone Group after this week's tepid earnings, as the annual report released yesterday
shows that the private-equity concern's partners still have an embarrassment of riches.
That the June initial public offering reaped the company billions of dollars is well-known. The annual report
sheds new light on the less-well-publicized annual cash distributions the partners receive from the company --
figures that are just as eye-popping, although down slightly from the halcyon days of 2006.
Blackstone head Stephen Schwarzman received $350.2 million in cash distributions last year, a 12% pay cut
from 2006, when he received $398.2 million in cash distributions. Peter Peterson, the company's co-founder,
received $171.5 million in cash distributions last year, down 19% from the $212.9 million in cash distributions
he received in 2006.
A significant portion of those distributions comes from "carried interest," or the partners' cut of future profits of
fund investments, which are taxed at the capital-gains rate of 15%, not individual income-tax rates of as much
as 35%.
This structure rankles some compensation consultants and has drawn the scrutiny of Congress.
"The entire amount should be taxed at regular rates, the way any other professional is taxed," said Alan
Johnson, a managing director at executive-pay firm Johnson Associates. "No one can defend it with a straight
face."
A Blackstone spokesman says that in 2006, Mr. Schwarzman paid 36% of his income in taxes and anticipates
paying the same percentage in 2007.
Separately, Mr. Johnson says that these cash-distribution numbers should have asterisks because Mr.
Schwarzman and others could be forced to return money to the funds. If future asset sales in Blackstone's
private-equity portfolio turn south, the funds have a "clawback" feature that requires the company to refund
investors already-booked incentive fees.
"In the good times, the private-equity business model is the best deal going," Mr. Johnson says. "But these
current payouts don't reflect some of the potentially troubled transactions from the past two years."

Three Clues
To Ambitions
In China
For China deal makers, politics is business.

Chinese bureaucrats control the country's biggest companies, and bankers who want to nail the big deals
need to stay on top of what these bureaucrats are thinking.
This is the second week of the annual meeting of China's legislature, the best chance to hear the country's
top politicians deliver long speeches and for reporters to accost corporate chiefs. Here are three lessons:
1. Chinese banks are getting more ambitious.
China state-bank chiefs can't stop talking about buying opportunities. Some, like Bank of Communications
Chairman Jiang Chaoliang, see gold in targets whose share prices are lowered by the global credit crunch.
Signs point to Chinese banks that are eager to grow. Many are digesting their first big overseas deals and
learning the process. Look for China's big lenders to be more aggressive going forward.
2. No Financial Services Authority, for now. Chinese officials have toyed with the idea of combining the
country's three financial regulators into one megaregulator that might look like the United Kingdom's FSA.
The idea: to stem bureaucratic infighting and allow for globally competitive financial conglomerates.
Further evidence that it may not happen soon is talk that China will keep the heads of the three agencies and
central bank in place rather than moving them.
3. Telecommunications restructuring on hold?
Talk persists that China is likely to finalize a plan to restructure the country's six big telecommunications
operators into three soon. But China Mobile's Chairman Wang Jianzhou told the official Xinhua news agency
he hasn't received a final plan, and China Netcom's Zhang Chunjiang urged the government to move faster
on it.

In regard to Judy Shelton's "It's the Dollar, Stupid" (op-ed, March 5): It is the dollar if we wish to look only at
symptoms, but it is poor fiscal and monetary policy, and high taxes and regulatory costs if we look at
causes. A remedy involving fixing the prices of currencies would be just as bad as President Nixon's efforts to
fix prices and wages in 1971, when he also eliminated the convertibility of the dollar into gold. Fixed
exchange rates or a world currency are ideas that are anticompetitive and associated with an old world of
government capital controls on currencies and commodities like gold. Let's fix the source of the problem,
starting with better fiscal and monetary discipline, and lower taxes that increased the returns to economic
resources.
Oscar Varela
Professor of Finance

Ms. Shelton is so right to call attention to the falling value of the dollar and to the fact that monetary
manipulation is akin to moving the international trade goalposts. It is indeed shocking, and a measure of
America's international myopia, that in all the presidential primary debates of both parties so far, the issue of
exchange rates and America's unsustainable trade deficit haven't been raised by either the candidates or the
press. The phone ringing in the White House at 3 a.m. is much more likely to herald a collapse of the dollar
and an international financial crisis than a war.
All the candidates need to plan on day one to change the present one economy-two systems structure of
globalization under which the U.S. consumes, imports, accumulates trade deficits and borrows while most of
the rest of the world saves, exports and lends to the U.S. The exchange rates between the dollar and most
Asian currencies must be reset. Export-oriented currency management practices must be halted while
commitments are made to save more in the U.S. and to consume more in Asia.

Crude-Oil Futures Soar To Another High, $107.90

Crude-Oil Futures Soar To Another High, $107.90

HOUSTON -- Crude futures moved further into uncharted territory, with oil gaining momentum in defiance of a
decline in other commodities.
Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose $2.75, or 2.6%, to $107.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, a settlement record. The front-month contract hit an intraday high of $108.21, marking the ninth
out of the last 10 sessions in which a record was set.
Futures have risen $20 in less than two months, largely on the weakness in the dollar, which makes
commodities priced in the U.S. currency relatively cheap for buyers in other currencies. This allows
speculative investors to interpret signs of a U.S. recession as a reason to drive up prices on the expectation
that more negative economic data could inspire the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, further weakening
the dollar.
But the dollar held steady yesterday, helping send metals lower and muting gains in distillates and gasoline,
which over the past few weeks have risen in concert with -- and often in excess of -- crude futures. Crude oil
appears to have gained its own momentum, market participants said.
"It's fast money chasing faster money," said Dean Hazelcorn, a trader with Coquest Inc. in Dallas. "Why
crude oil? That's where the volume is."
Oil's surge pulled along precious metals, with gold, silver and copper narrowing losses, though all ended the
day lower. Retail gasoline prices edged closer to a record at the pump, having surged to within half a cent of
their record of $3.227 a gallon. The national average price of a gallon of gasoline rose 0.7 cent overnight to
$3.222 a gallon, 69 cents higher than one year ago, according to AAA and the Oil Price Information Service.
Last May, prices peaked at $3.227 as demand and a string of refinery outages raised concerns about
supplies.
Crude's move yesterdayfrom an intraday low of just over $104 a barrel to the latest record was a
"self-fulfilling, self-reinforcing price advance," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in
Galena, Ill.
The Energy Information Administration releases its short-term energy outlook today and weekly oil and
product inventory data tomorrow. These indicators, along with the Commerce Department's retail sales data
Thursday, are traditionally used as cues for oil prices, though their impact has been muted lately.
A Dow Jones Newswires survey of analysts found an average forecast of a 1.7 million-barrel increase in oil
inventories for the week ended March 7.
In other commodity markets:
COPPER: Futures fell as traders booked profits from a large price run-up since early February and in reaction
to a decline in Chinese imports of unwrought copper and copper products, analysts said. April copper on the
Comex division of the Nymex lost 12.15 cents to settle at $3.8030 a pound.
WHEAT: Prices rose as traders positioned themselves ahead of a government crop report. Chicago Board of
Trade March wheat surged 47.50 cents to $11.40 a bushel.

Bush and the Dollar

When President George W. Bush addresses the Economic Club of New York on Friday, his comments on the
dollar crisis will be the crucial issue for markets and the economy. The best thing he could do would be to
state clearly that he wants a stronger dollar. That would draw liquidity back to the U.S., lower inflation risks,
and head off the growing calls for government bailouts and support programs.
Absent administration support for the dollar, recent Fed rate cuts have simply sped up the flood of capital
away from the U.S. without providing enough domestic stimulus. The rest of the world is already full of cheap
dollars, pushing gold and oil to new highs, European tourists onto Madison Avenue, and petro-dollar
sovereign wealth funds into building islands to use up their excess.
A clear presidential preference for a stronger dollar could cause an immediate leap in financial markets. U.S.
stocks and corporate bonds are attractively priced -- except for the dollar risk. No matter how high a bond
yield or how strong the track record of a U.S. private-equity manager, the threat of continued dollar weakness
holds global liquidity at bay. The prospect of a stronger dollar would reverse that.
This week, Mr. Bush may well use the same inadequate mantras that the administration has repeated since
2001: A strong dollar is in the "national interest," and the dollar should reflect U.S. economic "fundamentals."
U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson used these standard phrases, now taken to be code words for a
weaker dollar, on March 3, with predictable results -- the dollar hit new lows last week. Jean-Claude Trichet,
the hard-money head of the European Central Bank, perhaps holding his nose, voiced similar
encouragement for the dollar on March 3 (and yesterday): "I consider it very important what has been
affirmed and reaffirmed by the U.S. authorities . . . according to whom a strong dollar is in the interest of
America."
Damned by faint praise. The officials are not saying they want a stronger dollar, or that they will do something
to stop the dollar's plunge. In fact, the U.S. has repeatedly prevented the G-7 group of finance ministers and
central bankers from discussing ways to strengthen the dollar, most recently by imposing a dollar-lite agenda
at the February G-7 meeting.
The current dollar mantra, coined in the 1990s, never made sense. Saying a strong dollar is in our "national
interest" ignored the need for dollar stability. It set no upper bound on the dollar's strength, causing a
destructive global deflation cycle from 1997 to 2001.
The dollar is now weaker than the loonie, the Canadian dollar, yet the same hollow 1990s phrases are being
mouthed. If a strong dollar is in the "national interest," then the seven-year dollar collapse is clearly in need of
a remedy. There's an equally deep logical flaw in claiming that the dollar should depend on economic
"fundamentals." A strong, stable currency is itself one of a country's most valuable fundamentals, not a
byproduct of other fundamentals. Our fundamentals haven't been nearly as bad as the dollar's seven-year
slide. More likely, the weak dollar trend is itself a bad economic fundamental, masking health elsewhere.
The policy shift to a stronger dollar is as critical for national security as it is for economic health. Oil would
cost less if the dollar were stronger, slowing the transfers to our antagonists in Venezuela, Iran and Russia. A
stronger dollar would allow U.S. wealth to grow as fast as foreign wealth, adding to our strength and
independence.
Though many economists still support the theory of unlimited free-floating exchange rates, no weak-currency
country has had a healthy economy. Momentum takes over and pushes currencies to extremes that can't be
hedged. Many also think current interest rates control currencies. But 1% more or less in annual interest
won't make up for a country's longer term intentions for its currency. Markets have labeled the U.S. a
weak-currency country. That's an albatross that the president should dump.

An administration decision to support a stronger dollar would be dramatic, and probably so unexpected that it
would break the dollar's downward momentum, and with it the defeatism now dragging us down. If the dollar
started up, the vicious cycle -- dollar weakness causing economic weakness and more dollar weakness --
could be reversed.
The president's dollar preferences matter even in the short run, setting expectations that become
self-fulfilling. The many speculators now short-selling the dollar, or betting against the U.S. in favor of
commodities and other currencies, would have to reduce their positions. This would immediately add to U.S.
liquidity, and improve the outlook. Treasury would begin working to achieve a stronger dollar, opening the
possibility, anathema to dollar shorts, of a G-7 preference for a stronger dollar or even coordinated currency
intervention.
There's more at stake in the dollar debate than a recession, inflation and a bear market. In the economic
confusion created by the weak-dollar policy, presidential campaigners are blaming Nafta and free trade, not
the weak-and-weaker dollar, for hard times.
The president should state a preference for a stronger and stable dollar. It has a good chance of stopping the
credit crunch. It's free and easy. And let's face it: Other measures aren't working.

Job Market
Trend Isn't
Encouraging
Job-market indicators don't give much comfort to optimists who think the U.S. can avoid a recession.
True, the unemployment rate, at 4.9%, remains historically low. But it's been rising, and many other indicators
point clearly to a deteriorating job situation.
The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits is rising, though not yet to levels
associated with heavy layoffs. Weekly claims have averaged about 360,000 in the past four weeks, up from
an average of 325,000 six months ago, according to the Labor Department. Filings typically hit 400,000 or
more in recessions.
In all, the number of people getting jobless benefits hit 2.83 million in late February, the highest since a surge
after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The median duration of unemployment -- the length of time the typical unemployed person is out of work --
has risen, from a low of 7.5 weeks at the end of 2006 to 8.8 weeks in January. Every recession and
job-market downturn since 1967 has been heralded by such a climb.
People who do have jobs are spending less time doing them: Hours worked at nonfarm businesses fell at an
annualized pace of 1.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, the biggest decline since 2003.
According to Institute for Supply Management surveys, manufacturers have cut jobs the past four months and
the service sector has cut them the past two months. The National Federation of Independent Business's
small-business employment index is the lowest since May 2003.
In the Conference Board's latest consumer confidence survey, nearly 24% of respondents described jobs as
"hard to get," higher than in the first months of the 1990 and 2001 recessions.
On and on it goes. There's always a chance today's important monthly payroll jobs report could be better than
the market's low expectations. But the trend is clear: The job market is weakening.
Easy Come, Easy Go:
Economics of Bubbles
It's no coincidence that the latest surge in gold and oil prices has come as the Federal Reserve is slashing
interest rates.
The price of gold was flat for much of 2007. Then, since Aug. 17, when the Fed cut the rate it charges on
loans to banks from its "discount window," the price of gold started soaring. Since then, gold has gained
about 50%, closing at $977.10 an ounce yesterday. Oil prices followed a similar pattern.
Some economists say the Fed is repeating the mistake it made after the dot-com blowup. By slashing
interest rates aggressively to offset the pain of one bursting bubble, it inflated another bubble.
When the Fed lowered the federal-funds rate target to 1% in June 2003, it opened the door to aggressive
lending in the housing market. Today, by pumping dollars into the weakened financial system, the Fed could
be pumping up the prices of hard assets like oil and gold.

"We may be going from bubble to bubble," says Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.
The problem is that the only other choice for the Fed is to do nothing and let the economy fall into a
recession.
"The Fed was created to avoid financial crises and get us out of them when they happen, and that's what
they're trying to do."

Profit-Taking Slows Gains; Oil Rises Again

Profit-Taking Slows Gains; Oil Rises Again

Proving common wisdom that says prices don't normally go straight up even during a bull run, many
commodity markets set back as participants booked profits, taking the major commodity indexes lower,
analysts said.
Commodity prices had been on record pace, with benchmarks reached in gold, platinum, crude oil, grains
and soft commodities this week alone. Selling caught up with the markets yesterday, however and many
markets tumbled from the highs, although crude oil rose to another high, helping stave off more serious
losses.
"This is general commodity liquidation," said Zachary Oxman, senior trader with Wisdom Financial. "We've
had such a run-up that I think what you're seeing is a lot of funds and big speculators liquidating commodities
positions across the board."
Platinum futures, palladium, silver, coffee, sugar and soybeans were some markets that led the decline,
although the losses stretched all the way from the Dow Jones Industrial Average to inflation-sensitive
commodities such as gold, analysts said. Crude oil and natural gas experienced choppy trading.
Concerns over economic weakness and speculation that the credit crunch may worsen forced the selling.
The Continuous Commodity Index at the ICE Futures U.S. rallied to a record high of 576.98 in early trading,
but it succumbed to fund selling and was finished down 1.7% at 566.21.
Commodity losses came even though the dollar was soft versus the world's major currencies, one broker
said. Normally, a weak dollar benefits dollar-denominated commodities by making them cheaper to foreign
buyers.
The losses in metals, particularly platinum and palladium, were due in part to news that South Africa said it
intends to deliver 95% of electricity needs to its mines, up from 90%. South Africa is a major supplier of
platinum. New York Mercantile Exchange April platinum lost $75.30 per ounce to $2,200.80.
Soft commodities felt the pinch, as well, said Boyd Cruel, senior softs analyst at Alaron Trading. ICE May
sugar fell 0.95 cent to 13.6 cents a pound, struggling under ample supplies. ICE March coffee lost 9.75 cents
to end at $1.5200 a pound on technical-chart linked selling and profit-taking.
Crude oil and natural gas bucked the trend, with crude futures climbing to a record and natural gas ending
flat. Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled 95 cents, or 0.9%, higher at $105.47 a barrel on Nymex.
In other commodity markets:
EXCHANGES: Nymex Holdings Inc. and LCH.Clearnet agreed to offer several over-the-counter and futures
products for clearing through LCH.Clearnet. The products will include global-benchmark oil contracts such as
WTI, Brent and gasoil, and other natural-gas and electricity contracts. Trading and clearing is expected to
begin in mid-2008. The contracts will be listed for trading on the CME Globex electronic system and on
Nymex ClearPort for submission for clearing. Nymex Holdings Inc. is the parent company of the Nymex.

Dow Settles for Gain of 41.19 As Oil, Corn, Gold Hit Records

Oil prices soared following a surprising drop in U.S. inventories, while stocks took another wild ride to finish
with modest gains.
Up nearly 136 points at its high for the day and down 73.26 points at its low, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 41.19 points, or 0.3%, to 12254.99. It is down 7.6% this year.
Crude-oil futures rose 5% to a record $104.52 a barrel in New York, settling above an inflation-adjusted high
of $103.76 set in 1980 for the first time. Early in the session, traders responded to news that the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries left its output targets unchanged. The rally gained momentum after
government data showed a drop in U.S. inventories of crude oil and refined fuels, including the first drop in
gasoline storage in more than four months.
With gains of more than 2% each in its energy and basic-materials sectors, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index gained 0.5%, or 6.95 points, to 1333.70. The broad measure is down 9.2% in 2008. But the S&P's
financial sector fell more than 1%, led by a 19% plunge in Ambac Financial Group, after the bond insurer
unveiled a plan to offer at least $1 billion in stock to investors and said it will stop insuring mortgage-backed
debt in an effort to keep its top-tier credit rating.
Besides failing to satisfy investors' hopes for a larger capital infusion, the offering of additional Ambac shares
will dilute the value of existing holdings.
"People are looking around saying, how are they going to sell all this stock?" said Michael A. Church, portfolio
manager at Church Capital Management in Yardley, Pa. "I don't think it's going to be easy to price. Good luck
to the underwriters who, by the way, will probably be the same banks that have been burned" by bad credit
bets recently.
MBIA, another major bond insurer, fell 6.2%.
Mortgage-related shares were hit hard. Fannie Mae tumbled 6.5% to $24.27 a share, its lowest close since
September 1995, and is down 39% so far this year. Freddie Mac fell 4.1% and is down 36% in 2008.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 12.53 points, or 0.6%, to 2272.81. Year to date, it is off 14%.
The dollar fell to a new low against the euro, at $1.5265.
Crude's run-up in recent weeks has been part of a broader commodity surge driven by a combination of
industrial demand overseas and the search by many investors for alternatives to the uncertain stock market.
The broad-based Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index jumped 2.4%, or 5.177 points, to 219.036 as futures for
heating oil, corn and gold all hit records. Gold jumped 2.3%, or $22.30 per troy ounce, to $986.20 in New
York, though it is still far below its inflation-adjusted record of $2,239.67 from January 1980.
Silver rose 4.8%, its biggest percentage gain since July 2006, to $20.685 per troy ounce.

Ambac's Capital Plan: Far Enough? --- Rating Firms, Investors Look Askance at Move As Crunch Risks Linger
Credit Markets
Ambac's Capital Plan: Far Enough? --- Rating Firms, Investors Look Askance at Move As Crunch
Risks Linger
By Karen Richardson and Liam Pleven

Ambac Financial Group Inc. announced that it aims to raise $1.5 billion in much-needed capital, disappointing
some investors who had bet on a possible Wall Street bailout and expected the bond insurer to raise as much
as $3 billion.
While the plan fended off downgrades from rating firms Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's
Ratings Service, which have kept Ambac Financial Group's triple-A rating on review for downgrade, the plan
failed to return Ambac's ratings to the coveted "stable" status. Moody's and S&P said they would likely place
Ambac on "negative" outlook -- a step further away from imminent downgrade -- if it successfully raises the
capital but left open the possibility of cuts in the future.
"They still have a lot of work to do, especially in containing the risk in their subprime portfolio. Until they do,
we don't think there's a lot of lift potential," said Thomas Abruzzo, a managing director at Fitch Ratings. Fitch
cut Ambac in January to double-A and is still reviewing it for downgrade.
But underwriters, including some of the banks that had been part of bailout talks, have committed privately to
supporting the deal if there is a lack of demand, while private-equity investors have agreed to buy a certain
portion of the shares on the open market, according to investors who said they were briefed by Ambac.
There may still be risks ahead for Ambac, the world's second-biggest bond insurer by the amount of its
guaranteed debt outstanding.
A key part of what has put bond-insurer ratings under such pressure is projections about the possibility of
rising losses in the mortgages that back up securities the firms have insured. If those projections get more
dire, it is possible that ratings services could require more capital.
Ambac plans to raise at least $1 billion by selling common stock and $500 million from the sale of equity
units, a type of convertible security that gives the holder the option to buy newly issued common or preferred
shares in May 2011.
All but $100 million of the proceeds will go to buttressing Ambac's wholly owned unit that guarantees the
principal and interest on bonds in the event of default. The $100 million will go to the public holding company,
which will use the funds to help pay down debt. Ambac said it is also considering raising additional capital.
Ambac's plan comes more than a month after its biggest rival, MBIA Inc., raised $2.6 billion from new and
existing shareholders, including private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. MBIA's moves led to the affirmation
of its triple-A ratings from Moody's and S&P, although it remains on negative outlook.
Reflecting both investor disappointment and the large amount of earnings dilution that will likely result from
the offering, shares of Ambac fell 19% in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading after it released
its stock-offering prospectus. The shares, which had climbed in recent days on expectations of the move,
were down $2.02 to $8.70. Ambac's market value is now less than $1 billion, so a $1 billion stock offering
would dilute per-share earnings by more than 50%.
"In this offering, we are targeting our core investor base, the long-term holders of our stock, who have been
loyal to Ambac," Michael Callen, Ambac's interim chief executive, said in a statement.
The lack of a formal "backstop," in which banks agree to buy up any unsubscribed shares in a stock offering,
indicated that the bank consortium had decided against committing capital to the deal. That confounded
investors who didn't know about the underwriters' private agreement, leading them to sell shares. Citigroup
Inc. and UBS AG, which were part of the consortium, are also underwriters of the stock offering.

While Ambac now says it will exit from risky parts of the structured-finance business -- including writing
policies for debt securities backed by mortgage, credit-card and auto loans -- and focus on the
municipal-bond business, its plan falls short of a formal separation.
The offering document revealed a dispute between underwriters, including some of the consortium banks,
and Ambac over loss estimates. Some underwriters "have made estimates of our losses, estimates of credit
impairments and mark-to-market losses that in some cases materially exceed the amounts we have
reported," Ambac wrote. Ambac reported $6 billion last year in mark-to-market losses, which it says aren't
indicative of real future losses.
Inflation Worries Push
Treasurys Prices Lower
Longer-dated notes led the Treasury market lower as inflation worries gripped bond investors and economic
data beat expectations.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 30/32 point, or $9.375 for every $1,000 invested, to 98 13/32. Its yield,
which rises when prices fall, increased to 3.695% from 3.583%.
Ten- and 30-year bonds are the most sensitive to inflation, which eats into their fixed, long-term returns.
Yesterday, the dollar tumbled to another record low against the euro, fueling upward pressure on import
prices and sending crude oil and gold to new highs. The government also revised up labor-cost gains in the
fourth quarter, a further sign of increasing price pressures.
-- Min Zeng
Doubt Cast on County Bailout
As Jefferson County, Ala., continues efforts to avoid bankruptcy, an Alabama official said there is no
state-level mandate for a bailout should the county default on its debt. "To my knowledge, there is no
statutory system or scheme that would cover a situation of this type that relates to the state serving as a
backstop," said Ken Wallis, chief legal adviser to Alabama Gov. Bob Riley.
Jefferson County is in talks to refinance its sewer revenue debt in an effort to avoid a $184 million collateral
payment due March 7. The payment stems from problems with interest-rate swaps contracts.

Dow Loses 45.10 as Comeback Fails to Erase All of Big Loss

Dow Loses 45.10 as Comeback Fails to Erase All of Big Loss

After getting hammered throughout the day, stocks managed a partial comeback.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, off more than 226 points at its early afternoon low, trimmed its losses to
end down 45.10 points, or 0.4%, at 12213.80, off 7.9% this year. Such gyrations are getting to be a pattern.
The Dow has had intraday swings of 200 points or more in 29 of 43 trading days this year as new information
drives investor sentiment.
Early in the session, Dow components Intel and Citigroup led the way lower. Intel cut its gross-margin
forecast for the quarter because of lower prices for memory chips used in a variety of gadgets. Merrill Lynch
cut its estimates for Citigroup's earnings, citing the possibility of an additional $15 billion in debt-related
write-downs in the first quarter.
Intel finished little changed, after retreating as much as 2.7% in the early afternoon. Citigroup, down as much
as 8.1%, finished off 4.3%.
The tech sector, which tumbled on the Intel forecast, recovered after Cisco Chairman and Chief Executive
John Chambers said he has grown "even more comfortable" with the networking giant's long-term growth
rate.
Google hit a 52-week low during the day, declining 4.6% and off nearly 42% from its peak of $747.24 in
November. But by the end of the day the shares were down 2.7% from Monday's close.
Basic-materials and energy stocks fell amid a slide in oil prices. After briefly topping an inflation-adjusted
high of more than $103 on Monday, crude futures plummeted 2.9% to $99.52 a barrel in New York, as traders
placed bets ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and weekly data on
U.S. inventories due today. Gold prices slid 1.8%.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 0.3%, or 4.59 points, at 1326.75, down 9.6% in 2008.
Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke offered little solace. The central banker said more
needs to be done to help troubled homeowners, including a broader effort by financial firms to write down the
principal of some problem loans.
But late in the session, investors were heartened by reports that troubled bond insurer Ambac is near a deal
for an infusion of capital to shore up its business. Ambac shares jumped 7.9%.

Some Option Traders Shift Sights to Silver
Options Report
Some Option Traders Shift Sights to Silver

Gold stocks have led the run for precious-metal stocks on the approach to the $1,000-an-ounce level, but
yesterday some options traders backed the recent runner-ups: silver miners.
Gold and silver are among the hard assets that investors have piled into to preserve value as the dollar loses
ground overseas. The precious metals are also considered hedges against inflation because their price rises
along with that of consumable goods.
Gold futures fell sharply to about $964 an ounce from the verge of $1,000, as that psychological barrier
apparently scared off buyers. Silver futures snapped a 10-session winning streak.
On the options market, however, a large bullish trade went through on Apex Silver Mines Ltd., even as shares
of Apex fell 9.1% to $11.80 (Amex), and marked a 52-week low. Shares have retreated after a recent
earnings report, despite silver's rise to hit a 27-year high on Monday.
"But even as the underlying share hit the skids, our computers show institutional smarties buying into [Apex
Silver's prospects] in a big way!" said Jon Najarian, co-founder of OptionMonster, in a note to clients.
An order for about 10,000 contracts, representing 100 underlying shares apiece, went through for the right to
buy the stock at $15 on expiry in July. Only 1,000 options were outstanding at that strike price.
Many gold miners' stocks have fared better than silver miners' stocks. Shares of both Apex Silver and peer
Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. are down year-to-date, in contrast to double-digit percentage increases for gold
miners such as Goldcorp Inc. and Newmont Mining Corp. That gap could close if the precious-metals surge
continues, said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research.
Elsewhere, investors continued to flee mortgage-lending issues, and the options market reflected a belief that
things will go from bad to worse.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recommended that banks write down some of the principal amount
of troubled home loans. That could mean more losses for lenders.
Shares of government-backed lender Freddie Mac fell 4.9% to $22.57, and earlier set a new 52-week low.
Traders clamored for the right to sell shares of Freddie Mac for $17.50 upon expiry in April, and 59,600 of
those put contracts traded. A similar pattern emerged in Fannie Mae, whose shares fell 1.9% to $25.95.
Traders snapped up March $24 puts, which expire at the end of next week.

When the United States broke up the Bretton Woods international monetary system on Aug. 15, 1971, it
marked the official end of an era when the dollar was literally "as good as gold." President Nixon's
announcement -- that the U.S. would no longer permit foreign central banks to redeem U.S. dollars for gold
at the established fixed rate -- shocked Japan and Europe, our main overseas trade partners.
It was the repudiation of a formal agreement hammered out some 27 years earlier at Bretton Woods, N.H.,
and signed by delegates from 29 participating nations. The whole purpose of the agreement -- which was
initiated by the U.S. -- was to establish a stable, post-World War II monetary foundation so that free trade
could flourish. Never again would nations shortsightedly cheapen their currencies to obtain an unfair
advantage; the nightmare of economic warfare leading to military warfare would be ended.
Today, our trade partners are no longer shocked. They have come to expect domestically-focused monetary
policy from America. But they are deeply concerned by the demise of the once-dependable dollar and deeply
impacted by the economic distortions caused by skewed exchange rates. They are, no doubt, deeply
affronted by what they detect as the same cavalier attitude that decades earlier prompted Nixon's Treasury
Secretary, John Connally, to quip to U.S. allies: "It may be our currency -- but it's your problem."
Has the U.S. forever given up on the dream of a rules-based monetary order for a global economy dedicated
to free trade? Have we abandoned all sense of duty associated with providing the world's key reserve
currency?
These days it's easy to forget that, during the Great Depression years leading to World War II, floating
exchange rates were not considered the free-market approach to currencies. They were considered the
antithesis of global monetary order. Whereas the international gold standard guaranteed a level playing field
in the trade arena, facilitating market-based outcomes among well-intentioned competitors in an open global
marketplace, a nation that devalued its money against gold -- i.e., floated its currency -- was considered to be
cheating.
Monetary manipulation was akin to moving the goalposts, an attempt to increase exports of your country's
goods by rendering them less expensive when calculated in foreign currencies. Other nations responded with
protectionist tariffs on imported goods and tit-for-tat currency devaluations of their own, strangling
international trade and worsening the downward economic spiral.
Historical perspective is critical to understanding where we are now -- and what our nation may be facing
even as we evaluate leading presidential contenders.
Money meltdown is not some remote topic to be relegated to abstruse scholarly articles published by
universities, think tanks, and global institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. (Especially not the
IMF, which long lost its mandate to preserve the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.) The
consequences of currency chaos affect the personal fortunes of millions of individual citizens; once
unleashed, it can spawn social resentments and political upheavals that change the destiny of whole nations.
We need to ask Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John McCain what they would do -- if anything -- to
restore the integrity of the dollar as a meaningful unit of account, a reliable store of value. Would they put
forward any new proposals for more comprehensive international monetary reform?
Given that Sen. Obama has garnered the support of Paul Volcker, the highly-respected former chairman of
the Federal Reserve under Presidents Carter and Reagan, U.S. voters are apt to get a meaningful and
well-considered reply. "I think we are skating on increasingly thin ice," Mr. Volcker noted in the Washington
Post in April 2005. He warned that the stagflation of the 1970s was characterized by "a volatile and
depressed dollar, inflationary pressures, a sudden increase in interest rates and a couple of big recessions."

Mr. Volcker's solution? Act now to comply with "the oldest lesson of economic policy: a strong sense of
monetary and fiscal discipline."
On the broader issue of global monetary reform, Mr. Volcker's ideas are less orthodox, more visionary. "My
sense is that if we are to have a truly globalized economy, with free movement of goods, services and capital,
a world currency makes sense," he stated in January 2000. "That would be a world in which the objectives of
growth, economic efficiency and stability can best be reconciled."
Sen. McCain, for his part, suffers from an embarrassment of riches when it comes to economic advice.
One of his chief advisers is former Sen. Phil Gramm, a budget-balancing fiscal conservative with a Ph.D. in
economics. Mr. Gramm is a disciple of the late Milton Friedman -- the Nobel laureate who furnished the
academic rationale in the 1960s for ditching Bretton Woods and letting currencies float -- and might thus be
expected to oppose any sweeping reforms to international monetary relations. Yet he has consistently
emphasized the need "to refocus the IMF on its core mission of short-term lending to address financial and
monetary instability." He considers protectionism "immoral."
Another McCain adviser, Jack Kemp, champions tax cuts and pro-growth policies over budgetary rigidity. A
hero of the supply-side movement whose tireless efforts helped to bring about the Reagan boom of the
1980s, Mr. Kemp has never shied away from bold proposals.
Testifying before Congress in 1999, he criticized protectionist instincts that were misdirected at free and open
trade "instead of the real source of the problem -- an international monetary arrangement of floating
currencies in which no currency is linked to a stable anchor and all countries are tempted to use currency
devaluation as an economic policy instrument during times of economic duress." Mr. Kemp's favored
economic scholar is Robert Mundell, who received his Nobel for historical research on the operation of the
gold standard and his theory of optimal currency areas. Considered the intellectual father of the euro, Mr.
Mundell believes gold could be used as a reserve asset in a reformed international monetary system for the
21st century.
If the reality of a collapsing dollar and foreign exchange turmoil starts to bite consumers where they keep their
pocketbooks -- for example, if the U.S. finds it necessary to raise interest rates to entice foreigners to buy
the government bonds that finance our deficit -- the affects of currency misalignment could quickly move from
the realm of dry treatises to the hyperactive world of live, televised political debate. Media consultants may
grow apoplectic at the thought of having to reduce seemingly complex options into clever sound bites: Does
the candidate advocate a new global monetary order linked to a universally-recognized reserve asset as a
mechanism to guard against tinkering by self-serving governments? ("Gold: Money We Can Believe In.") Or
is it possible to defend the existing, do-your-own-thing approach to currency relations, which undermines
stable trade and capital flows at the expense of global prosperity? Meanwhile, foreign-exchange market
specialists earn big profits by gambling -- some $3 trillion daily -- on where currencies might go next.
It's time the candidates devote less time on the minutiae of configuring the next economic stimulus package,
or renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. They should be thinking about how they will
confront the imminent global currency crisis.
It's the dollar, stupid.

Hard Assets an Easy Call?

Hard Assets an Easy Call?

Oil edged past a 28-year-old record and gold approached a new landmark yesterday as investor fears about
inflation combined with energy-supply fears to spur a continuing flight into hard assets.
Crude-oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange touched $103.95 a barrel in intraday trading before
settling at $102.45. Oil has now surpassed its longstanding April 1980 record, when adjusted for inflation to
January 2008 dollars, of $103.76 a barrel.
Gold inched closer to the psychologically important threshold of $1,000 an ounce, hitting an intraday high of
$986.90 before settling at a record $981.50 on the Comex division of Nymex. The most-active gold contract
for April delivery hit $992 during the day.
Philip Verleger, an independent energy economist in Aspen, Colo., says the dramatic surge of oil and gold in
the past few days is a reaction to testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to Congress. Mr.
Verleger said Mr. Bernanke signaled that the Fed's economists are "not so much worried about inflation as
they are worried about the state of economy. That's a clear sign to everybody they are going to cut interest
rates again and inject more liquidity into the financial system. And it's a clear sign to the financial community
that inflation rates are likely to rise. And the natural response of investors to such a signal is to increase their
purchases of hard assets."
Unlike oil, gold is still less than half its inflation-adjusted peak of $2,239.67, hit on Jan. 21, 1980. In January
1980, inflation was 13.9%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Today, inflation stands at 4.3%.
"I would say we haven't seen the high for gold just yet," says Bart Melek, Global Commodity Strategist, BMO
Capital Markets, in part because "inflation today is nowhere near as high as inflation during that period" and
investors will pile into gold if the inflation picture worsens.
Rising oil prices have perplexed some oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
or OPEC, who are gathering in Vienna this week at an unusually tense time for oil markets and the world
economy. The U.S. and Europe both want OPEC to boost output, arguing that world inventories remain low
and that sky-high energy prices could deepen America's economic woes.
But with the U.S. economy in the doldrums and demand for oil cooling in much of the world, many OPEC
ministers contend that the market is awash in crude and that financial speculators are driving up the price.
Still, OPEC ministers are acknowledging more so than in the past that concerns about a longer-term
tightening in supplies is also behind the breakneck rise in oil prices. In an interview published yesterday
(MON)<NO> in Petrostrategies, OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi, blamed the price surge
partly on increasing pessimism over world petroleum reserves and "a vision of tightness in the market which
is unfounded."
But Jeffrey Currie, senior energy economist at Goldman Sachs, says the oil industry's built-in inefficiencies
and chronic underinvestment are key factors driving prices higher. Amid the latest run-up in spot prices, Mr.
Currie said the more telling fact is that contracts for oil for delivery five years from now have gone up even
faster.
Meanwhile, a drooping dollar is helping to push up oil prices, as well. The dollar briefly touched a record low
against the euro Monday before recovering slightly. Late in New York, one euro fetched $1.5210.
Although the dollar and oil have not moved in sync over the longer term, there has been a close connection
between them in the past few years. From the start of last year until now, the price of oil and the euro's
exchange rate against the dollar have moved in the same direction about 96% of the time, says Greg
Anderson, a currency strategist at ABN Amro. In other words, when oil is rising, the dollar is weakening
versus the euro almost all of the time.

"People start to trade these relationships, so it becomes self-fulfilling," says Philip Klapwijk, chairman of
GFMS, a London precious-metals research company.
At its previous meeting, a month ago, the group of 13 countries composing OPEC said rising oil inventories
and ebbing growth in demand this year could justify a formal trimming of output.
But with oil breaking into record territory, it may be politically untenable for OPEC ministers meeting tomorrow
in Vienna to cut production.
OPEC will most likely agree to do nothing for now, with promises to meet again in a month or two to assess a
market whose volatility continues to surprise most analysts. OPEC supplies just less than 40% of the world's
daily thirst for oil, which is running around 87 million barrels a day.
Libya's top oil official, Shokri Ghanem, reflected the exasperation of many within OPEC when asked if the
cartel would stick to the status quo. "How can you do otherwise?" he said. "How can you cut production when
prices are so high? How can you increase production when inventories are expanding?"
Investors also herded into commodity markets around 1980, driving up prices as inflation fears mounted.
Some fear a repeat of the price spikes and falls. Stephen Schork, editor of Schork Report, a daily newsletter
on energy, adds, "We're on this sort of perverted circle of logic where I am buying because I am thinking
prices are going higher, but my buying now is actually driving the prices higher. This is a vicious cycle now
the market is on."
In other commodity markets yesterday:
NATURAL GAS: Futures sold off late in the trading session on profit taking. Rising gas prices have outpaced
the degree of supply tightness in the U.S., where the commodity is still readily available. Natural gas for April
delivery settled two cents, or 0.2%, lower at $9.346 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
WHEAT: Prices at the Chicago Board of Trade closed higher as new investment money entered the market
and more signs of solid global demand emerged. A sharp selloff last week had pulled prices off record highs,
but a weekend purchase by key importer Egypt helped wheat futures reverse course and move higher.
Nearby March climbed 20 cents to settle at $10.93 a bushel.

Inflation Rears Its Ugly Head Once Again

Inflation Rears Its Ugly Head Once Again

David Ranson's op-ed correctly states that inflation is worse than people think, "Inflation May Be Worse
Than We Think" (Feb. 27). Though it is true that the technical reasons he submits account for hiding real
inflation to some extent, there are other reasons Americans always are caught by surprise by inflation.
The Fed has refused, for years, to admit that it seeks to minimize inflation by insisting that only "core rates,"
excluding energy and food costs, count when totting up our cost of living. Unfortunately, nearly all economists
and the media, including the Journal -- until just lately -- have followed the same line and have agreed with
the Fed.
Those of us in the real world, who buy gasoline and groceries and pay utility bills, have known for years that
inflation was getting much worse, and we have been expecting something worse than the 1979-81 disaster
to strike. The Fed, in its rush to stave off a recession, now even tells us in advance that it will continue to
slash rates, so we can all brace ourselves for headline inflation.
When baby boomers start retiring in very large numbers in three years, and the new wave of inflation is
really hurting us, there will be severe political repercussions. I thought Mr. Ranson's article was ultra mild,
considering how very right he is.

Aside from the pure entertainment value, late night TV hucksters pushing the latest, greatest diet pill or
household cleaner prompt me to ask but one question: Does anyone actually believe this stuff? I react
similarly to release of the Consumer Price Index figures. After writing checks for home heating fuel,
transportation, real estate taxes, food and 20 other major items, I ask "Does anyone actually believe the
CPI?" Mr. Ranson challenges government reports that have obviously understated actual inflation over the
past five years. It is amusing to see on my monitor gold at $960, oil at $100 and 10-year Treasury bonds
yielding 3.81%. We have heard every excuse in the book from pundits: Energy inflation is actually a tax on
the economy; U.S. businesses do not have the pricing power to pass along higher costs. These statements
have proven to be entirely untrue but then we must remember that these sources are the same who in the
1990's suggested P/E ratios of 30:1 were sustainable.
Unfortunately, simply acknowledging actual inflation today will not correct the massive mispricing of inflation
risk in the markets. Alan Greenspan's mantra that what is good for equity investors is good for the country
burdened us with unjustifiably low interest rates for too long, creating the environment that now forced Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke to sharply cut the discount rate to about half actual inflation. Further reductions in
already historically low rates will do little to spur growth and only take us into higher inflation territory. And
China's inelastic demand for U.S. Treasuries places a cap on interest rates, exaggerating the miss-pricing.
In the end, it is the investor willing to accept paltry yields on bonds that will shoulder the worst of the
inevitable and significant yield correction.

For the Fed, a Recession -- Not Inflation -- Poses Greater Threat
THE OUTLOOK
For the Fed, a Recession -- Not Inflation -- Poses Greater Threat
By Greg Ip

Two fears hang over the U.S. economy: wrenching recession and spiraling inflation.
Yet history suggests the two almost never happen at the same time. And that explains why the U.S. Federal
Reserve, for now, has chosen to focus on the first threat rather than the second.
Fed officials believe that those who say it is courting a return of 1970s-style "stagflation" -- stagnant growth
and inflation -- misinterpret the lessons of that decade. The bigger test of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's
anti-inflation resolve may not be how much he cuts rates during a downturn, but how soon he raises them
afterward.
Last week brought unrelenting bad news for Mr. Bernanke. New-home sales and consumer confidence
tumbled while claims for unemployment insurance rose. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that
the price index of personal-consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, rose 3.7% in
January from a year earlier, its second-biggest increase since 1991. More worrisome, "core" inflation, which
excludes food and energy, accelerated to 2.2% in January from 1.9% in August. It has been above the
1.5%-to-2% range Fed officials define as price stability for 37 of the previous 46 months.
So why is the Fed more worried about growth than inflation? First, it thinks run-ups in commodity prices
explain the increases, not only in overall inflation but also in core inflation: higher energy costs have
"passed through" to other goods and services. Core inflation rose and fell with energy inflation between
early 2006 and mid-2007, and the Fed thinks the same thing is probably happening now. If energy and food
prices stop rising -- they don't have to actually fall -- both overall and core inflation should recede.
So far, they're still rising: wheat, oil and gold hit nominal records last week. But Fed officials don't think the
latest jump can be justified by fundamental supply and demand. U.S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline are
plentiful. Strong demand from China isn't new and should have been factored into prices long ago. A more
likely explanation: investors, perhaps alarmed by the Fed's dovish stance, are pouring money into commodity
funds and foreign currencies as a hedge against inflation.
Such fears can be self-fulfilling as higher food, energy and import costs work their way into consumer prices.
But speculative price gains can't be sustained if the fundamentals don't support them. If the Fed and the
futures markets are right, prices will be lower, not higher, a year from now.
For the current high inflation rates to become permanent, the Fed believes it has to become embedded in
how workers and businesses set wages and prices. So far, surveys suggest consumers haven't raised their
expectations of inflation much. In last year's fourth quarter, hourly wages and benefits were up just 3% from
a year earlier, a slowdown from 2006, even though unemployment was below 5% for almost all that period. A
wage-price spiral requires wages to cooperate.
Wages are even less likely to accelerate if unemployment, now 4.9%, rises to 5.25% this year and falls only
gradually to 5% by 2010, as the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee forecasts. That implies three years
with the unemployment rate above the FOMC's estimated "natural" rate of about 4.9%, and thus steady
downward pressure on inflation.
The notion that higher unemployment reduces inflation has its skeptics, even at the Fed. "All you have to do
is recall the 1970s, when we experienced both high unemployment and high inflation, to appreciate that slow
economic growth and lower inflation don't necessarily go hand in hand," Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said last month.
Yet inflation did fall after the recessions of 1969-70, 1973-75 and 1980. In fact, Fed research has found that
a given amount of unemployment had twice the impact on inflation then as now.

--- Page 131 ---
Page 131 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
So why were both unemployment and inflation higher at the end of the 1970s than at the beginning? In the
1960s the Fed thought it could achieve lower unemployment by accepting slightly higher inflation. But the
trade-off proved temporary. As workers adjusted their wage expectations to higher inflation, unemployment
returned to its natural rate, which is determined by demographic and structural factors.
The Fed did raise interest rates when inflation rose, and the resulting recessions pushed inflation down.
But because of political pressure, ignorance, or both, the Fed couldn't tolerate high unemployment for long
and quickly took its foot off the monetary brake, and inflation bottomed out higher than where it began.
Workers and firms were quick to adapt to that higher inflation. It took the deep 1981-82 recession to break
that inflationary psychology. When inflation expectations rise, "it is very costly to the economy" to get them
down again, Mr. Plosser said.
Critics say the Fed also took too long to reverse the ultralow rates of 2001-2003, thereby fueling the housing
bubble -- if not rampant inflation -- whose collapse now threatens the economy. Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis President William Poole became one of the first people who participated in that decision to repudiate it.
"With the benefit of hindsight . . . it is not hard to argue that the [Fed] was too slow to raise the federal-funds
target after taking the target down to 1% in 2003," he said at a conference on Friday.
Even Fed officials who don't share that view agree that both that episode and the 1970s experience argue for
promptly reversing rate cuts once the current crisis passes.
That's easier said than done. The Fed is unlikely to face an outlook so unambiguously positive anytime soon
that such a reversal will be a slam-dunk, and during an election year, it will face intense political pressure not
to raise rates.
Whether the Fed reverses course "on an appropriate schedule" will be clear in five years or so, Mr. Poole
said.

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Avoiding the Danger Zone: Conventional strategies for turbulent markets might not work anymore...
Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Avoiding the Danger Zone: Conventional strategies for
turbulent markets might not work anymore; Here are new moves for the risk averse

Corrections & Amplifications
The name of the Hussman Strategic Growth Fund was incorrectly given as Hussmann Strategic Growth in an
Investing in Funds article Monday.
(WSJ March 5, 2008)
(END)
As investors seek shelter from the market turbulence, the usual safe places don't feel so safe anymore.
Treasury bonds and gold, for example, have attracted so many investors that financial advisers are wary of
funds specializing in those assets. The stampede to gold has pushed the precious metal to record highs,
while Treasury yields have been driven so low there is little reason for many investors to hold them, given
current inflation.
Meanwhile, there is new risk associated with other popular havens such as "value" funds, which tend to
invest heavily in dividend-paying stocks. Many of those funds are loaded with financial shares, including
some that have been battered by the subprime-mortgage meltdown and credit crunch.
It may be time for prudent investors to inspect some lesser-known havens, say financial advisers and fund
analysts. They point to a number of funds with solid track records of safeguarding assets that recently have
reopened to new investors, and they highlight some new offerings with fresh approaches to safety-minded
investing.
A number of new dividend-focused funds, for example, search the globe for good values, while other new
funds are borrowing strategies from the investment pools for the wealthy known as hedge funds, aiming to
protect investors from stock-market slides.
Here is a look at the types of funds that advisers and analysts believe provide a relatively high degree of
safety in today's market while also holding out the possibility of higher returns than some traditional havens
are likely to see.
STOCK FUNDS
Funds focused on out-of-favor value stocks -- stocks whose prices are considered cheap relative to their
per-share earnings or book value -- are often a good haven "because there's a built-in safeguard against
overheated markets," says Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar Inc. Value stocks also
often pay steady dividends, which can give investors a cash cushion in times of market turmoil.
Financial stocks currently make up nearly one-fourth of assets in the average large-cap value fund, according
to Morningstar. The big unknown is how exposed these financial companies still are to the mortgage-market
problems.
Investors may want to consider some of the value-oriented funds that recently reopened to new investors and
that have strong track records of cushioning blows during rocky markets. Longleaf Partners, which reopened
in January, for example, gained 10.3% during the ugly market of 2001, outpacing the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index by 22 percentage points; it ranks in the top 6% of Morningstar's "large blend" category for the
past decade. Dodge & Cox Stock, which reopened in February, gained 9.3% in 2001, beating the S&P 500 by
21 percentage points; it is in the top 15% of Morningstar's "large value" category for the past five and 10
years.

--- Page 133 ---
Page 133 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Over the past year, both funds have struggled and are in the bottom third of their Morningstar peer groups,
though each committed substantially less to financial stocks than its typical peers did. The Longleaf fund had
just a 14.6% allocation to the financial sector as of Dec. 31 -- below average for a large blend fund, according
to Morningstar. Longleaf referred questions about recent fund performance to its annual report, which notes
that holdings like Level 3 Communications Inc., Sprint Nextel Corp., Comcast Corp. and Cemex SAB hurt
2007 returns.
Dodge & Cox also referred questions to recent fund reports, which note that technology, health care,
industrial and other holdings detracted from its 2007 performance, while the fund's significant underweighting
in financial stocks helped returns. Still, both funds "have usually limited their losses in down markets," and
may provide a haven for safety-seeking investors, Ms. Benz says.
Meanwhile, fund companies have been rolling out new funds that scour the globe for dividend-paying stocks
and that use more exotic strategies to put a damper on market volatility.
Last year, Eaton Vance Corp. introduced Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund,
while John Hancock Funds started John Hancock Tax-Advantaged Global Shareholder Yield Fund. These
"closed-end" funds invest in U.S. and foreign dividend-paying stocks and sell call options to boost income.
When a fund sells a call option on a stock, it sells another investor the right to buy the stock at a particular
price before a certain date. This provides a steady stream of income for such funds and offers investors a
buffer against stock slides. (Unlike the open-end mutual funds that small investors generally are most familiar
with, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares and typically trade on an exchange like a stock.)
Safety-minded investors shouldn't ignore "growth" stocks. These are shares of companies with earnings
expanding at a pace faster than that of the broader market. "Every portfolio should include some
steady-Eddie, blue-chip growth stocks, which arguably are pretty reasonably valued at this point," says Ms.
Benz.
One fund that focuses on such stocks and has a strong long-term track record is T. Rowe Price Blue Chip
Growth. The fund charges expenses of 0.77%, compared with 1.39% for the average large-cap growth fund.
Low expense ratios can be particularly important in tough market environments: Think of an expense ratio as
a hurdle that a manager has to clear every year before you earn anything on your investment.
BOND FUNDS
Because yields on Treasury bonds are in the basement, investors in Treasury-bond funds may be
hard-pressed to keep up with inflation. The 10-year Treasury yielded about 3.5% as of Feb. 29, while
inflation is over 4%.
The other danger is getting caught with too many bonds when the market mood brightens. In Treasury bills,
"you've had such a flight to safety . . . as that fear unwinds, you could get some nasty surprises" with prices
falling fast, says Peter Crane, president of Crane Data LLC, which tracks money markets.
A safer choice in this category may be a well-managed diversified bond fund. FPA New Income Fund can
hold mortgage-backed, agency, Treasury and corporate bonds. The low-cost fund hasn't suffered a
calendar-year loss in the nearly 24 years that it has been managed by Bob Rodriguez, and it has been in the
top quarter of its peer group over the past one, three, five and 10 years.
ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
Many financial advisers think that gold, which has soared more than 40% over the past year, may well be
due for a rest. What's more, like many commodities, the precious metal can be extremely volatile when held
as a stand-alone investment.
Better havens may be more-diversified funds -- those holding a variety of commodities or using other
alternative-investment strategies, advisers say.
Matthew Tuttle, president of Tuttle Wealth Management in Stamford, Conn., argues that "the perfect
safe-haven fund" is Permanent Portfolio, which holds gold, silver, real estate, growth stocks and other
assets. The fund, run by Pacific Heights Asset Management LLC, "has the premise that the future is
unpredictable," says portfolio manager Michael Cuggino. "By not predicting, not forecasting, but having
assets in a broad diversified mix, you provide the investor with a chance to profit from multiple outcomes," Mr.
Cuggino says.
The fund has below-average expenses for its category, hasn't posted a calendar-year loss since 1994, and is
in the top 1% of Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category over the past one, three, five and 10 years
through Feb. 28.

For investors who think the stock market has further to fall, fund companies have introduced a host of
"long-short" funds, many of which aim to protect investors from the market's downside. Shorting a stock
typically involves borrowing shares and then selling them, hoping to replace them later at a lower price.
Many of these funds lack long-term track records, and their performance in recent rough months has been
mixed. During the shaky markets of last July and August, the median long-short fund lost 1.8%, roughly in line
with the S&P 500 -- a performance that Morningstar analyst Marta Norton calls "unimpressive."
What's more, many of these funds charge steep expense ratios.
But some long-short funds do have strong track records and reasonable expenses. These include Calamos
Market Neutral Income, which beat the S&P 500 by 20 percentage points in 2001 and is ahead by 4.5
percentage points this year through Feb. 28, and Hussmann Strategic Growth, which beat the S&P
benchmark by 27 percentage points in 2001 and is ahead by about six percentage points so far this year. The
Calamos fund charges expenses of 1.18%, compared with 2.18% for the average long-short fund, while the
Hussmann fund charges 1.11%.

For Stocks, a Wrong-Way Feb. 29 'Leap' --- Coming Days May Not Deliver Much Relief; Industrials Fall

Friday's selloff leaves the stock market stuck in a rut, and it may go in deeper before it digs itself out.
With the market unable to muster any conviction about the future, it has been trading in a narrow range
despite violent moves in both directions. The pattern continued this past week. After a burst of optimism at
the start, stocks tumbled as fears bubbled anew about credit markets and the economy.
In the week to come, the economic calendar is heavy, headlined by the February payrolls report on Friday.
The schedule is light on earnings news -- which has been mostly good outside of the financial sector --
meaning the market might continue its downstroke.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 315.79 points Friday, or 2.5%, to 12266.39, leaving the
blue-chip average down 0.9% for the week despite strong gains in the first three trading days. The Dow is
down 7.5% this year and 13% below its record close in October. It fell 3% in February, its fourth straight
losing month.
All 30 Dow components were down Friday, the second-worst day of the year after a 370-point drop on Feb. 5.
American International Group led the way into the ditch, sinking 6.6%. The insurance company Thursday
evening reported its worst quarterly loss ever, because of bad bets in the credit market. Financial stocks sank
again.
A UBS estimate that the banking sector's credit losses could exceed $600 billion, along with reports that a
handful of hedge funds were furiously selling municipal bonds, deepened the gloom among the financials and
throughout Wall Street.
"If credit starts coming back and spreads loosen a bit, then the market will have a nice move to the upside -
but that might take three to six months," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen & Co. "Until then,
we will see these swings."
After each round of credit-related losses and bailout talk, investors have grown optimistic that the worst was
over, only to be flattened by another shoe falling.
A week ago, hopes for an imminent rescue of bond insurer Ambac triggered the market's most recent rally,
sending the Dow up more than 400 points in four days. Steady bad news this week, including downbeat
comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, more than eroded that rally. Thursday and Friday's
losses in the Dow totaled more than 425 points.
"The market came to its senses and said, 'Why are we up? We shouldn't be,'" said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head
of equity trading at Themis Trading.
Computer maker Dell fell 4.65% Friday after it reported disappointing quarterly results Thursday evening.
That helped drag the Nasdaq Composite Index down 2.6%. The technology-heavy index lost 1.4% on the
week and 4.95% for the month, and is down 14% for the year.
The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago on Friday said its regional business-activity
index tumbled to its lowest reading since the 2001 recession. The Commerce Department reported that
consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, was flat for the second straight month in January.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.7%, or 37.05 points, to 1330.63. It lost 1.7% this week and is
down 9.4% for the year. The selling affected every sector, from the safe to the economically sensitive. More
than six times as many stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors rushed to Treasury bonds for shelter. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which moves in the
opposite direction of price, fell to 1.649% from 1.876% on Thursday.
Oil slipped 75 cents to $101.84 a barrel after gaining 11% in February. The dollar recovered a bit against the
euro but fell against the yen. Gold prices rose to $972.10 an ounce.

Safety Net Breaks Again --- Wheat-Price Bets Lead To Big MF Global Loss Despite Risk Controls

Safety Net Breaks Again --- Wheat-Price Bets Lead To Big MF Global Loss Despite Risk Controls

It took only seven hours early Wednesday for a trader at MF Global Ltd. to make bad bets on the direction of
wheat prices that cascaded into $141.5 million in losses at the brokerage firm and exposed another
breakdown in Wall Street's risk management.
Yesterday's announcement of the ill-fated trades was an embarrassment for the Bermuda-based futures and
derivatives firm, which suffered a 28% drop in its share price. It was the steepest decline since MF Global
was spun off last year from hedge-fund giant Man Group PLC, and the blowup raised questions about how
one of the largest customers on several futures exchanges could have left itself so exposed to a single
trader's bets.
MF Global identified the trader as Evan Dooley, who worked in the firm's Memphis, Tenn., office until he was
fired for having "substantially exceeded his authorized trading limit."
In an interview, the 40-year-old Mr. Dooley, who goes by his middle name, Brent, blamed the trading loss on
the computer systems he was using. That system "failed on a lot of things," he said, including problems in
"setting limits." He declined to be more specific.
MF Global insisted that the breakdowns resulting in the steep loss were isolated and have been fixed. But
Kevin Davis, the brokerage's chief executive, acknowledged that existing internal controls could have stopped
Mr. Dooley's trades from being processed -- but were turned off in a few cases to allow for speedier
transactions by brokers at the firm who traded for themselves or took customer orders by phone.
"This is an absolutely awful event, but we believe it was an aberration in our risk controls. We believe that we
have fixed it," Mr. Davis said. The firm has hired FTI Consulting Inc., of Baltimore, to review its
risk-management procedures.
Mr. Dooley, who has spent more than 15 years in the rough-and-tumble business of commodities trading, had
just one customer, and that person hadn't done any trading business with Mr. Dooley in "some time," Mr.
Davis said. But the trader was allowed to process trades for his own account through MF Global, which
collected commissions on those transactions. Such arrangements are common in futures trading, even
though the brokerage firms essentially must use their own capital if traders can't afford outsize bets that go
wrong.
Mr. Dooley, who joined the firm in November 2005, was betting that wheat prices would fall from their recent
highs, according to a person familiar with the situation. Wheat and other commodities have surged in recent
weeks because of strong demand, tight supply and a cash infusion from investors.
Mr. Dooley entered into the trades between midnight and 7 a.m. Eastern time Wednesday, according to the
company, which said he placed orders for about 15,000 to 20,000 futures contracts, including March
contracts and "a number of other contracts."
The trades weren't made from the brokerage firm's Memphis office. Mr. Dooley often traded from his home in
Olive Branch, Miss., where he lives with his wife, according to Mr. Dooley's father, Evan Dooley. "He's not a
big trader. He's not a rogue trader," said Mr. Dooley after speaking with his son several times yesterday.
"He's a day trader. If he made $1,000 a day, that was a good day."
MF Global's risk-management procedures include "buying power controls" that are supposed to flag big or
risky trades that might expose the firm to potential losses. But those internal controls were sometimes turned
off at the Memphis office and possibly other locations in order to speed trades. The surge in
commodities-trading volume has created pressure on brokerage firms to keep up.

CME Group Inc.'s Chicago Board of Trade handled Mr. Dooley's orders. By Wednesday morning, though,
wheat prices were moving sharply higher, meaning that Mr. Dooley was suffering losses that far exceeded
the balance in his own trading account. Since his account was depleted, MF Global was forced to step in and
fund the trader's losing position.
"It happened very quickly," Mr. Davis said in a conference call. Mr. Dooley didn't have the capital "to support
even a fraction of his positions."
Some said MF Global's buying binge pushed wheat prices higher and fueled heavy trading Wednesday. It
took several hours to undo Mr. Dooley's trades, but Mr. Davis played down their role in price moves. Floor
trading of futures occurs in the daytime, while electronic trading through CME is during the day and from 6
p.m. to 6 a.m. Central time.
The MF Global mess was "certainly the main thing" that caused the market to gyrate Wednesday, said Vic
Lespinasse, analyst for Illinois Grain. The most actively traded May wheat contract surged by the
CBOT-imposed limit of $1.35 a bushel.
Covering Mr. Dooley's positions cost MF Global $141.5 million in cash, or about $80 million on an after-tax
basis. That is equal to about 6% of the brokerage firm's capital -- and exceeds the company's net income in
the fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.
Some of the loss might be recovered from insurance companies or mitigated by reduced bonuses at the firm,
but getting the money from Mr. Dooley isn't likely. The trader "doesn't appear to be terribly long of assets,"
Mr. Davis said.
National Futures Association records show no prior regulatory problems for Mr. Dooley. It isn't clear if he will
face disciplinary action from regulators stemming from his wheat-futures trades. The Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which regulates U.S. futures markets, is looking into the situation. In a statement, the
CFTC said the problem "appears to be an isolated event."
Outside of work, Mr. Dooley liked to go fishing, according to his father. Richard Gunter, who lives across the
street from a brick house in Eads, Tenn., where Mr. Dooley used to live, recalls seeing the trader leave for
work around 6 a.m. or 6:30 a.m. With the rise of electronic trading, though, Mr. Dooley could trade nearly 24
hours a day.
MF Global's shares fell $8.09, or 28%, to $21.19 yesterday in 4 p.m New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. That was the steepest decline since the company went public at $30 a share.
In other commodity news:
CRUDE OIL: Futures soared to another all-time high above $102, bolstered by the dollar's slide to new lows.
Crude oil has risen in 12 of the last 15 trading days, as a weak dollar pressures oil exporters to raise prices
and draws investment funds into commodities. Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled $2.95, or 3%,
higher at $102.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
SILVER: Prices rose, supported by anticipated lower interest rates and higher oil prices. Investor interest in
silver is increasing as some in the market think gold is "overdone" and some have been selling gold to buy
silver, especially after the yellow metal broke its 1980 high, said Don Tierney, precious-metals analyst with
B&C Trading. On the Comex division of the Nymex, nearby March silver rose 43 cents, or 2.2%, to $19.6400
an ounce after reaching $19.845, the highest front-month price since November 1980. Most-active May silver
gained 37.7 cents to $19.710.

Dow's 4-Day Win Streak Ends On Concern About Banks, Oil

Dow's 4-Day Win Streak Ends On Concern About Banks, Oil

Stocks snapped a four-day winning streak amid concerns about troubled banks and tapped-out consumers,
and a jump in oil prices to more than $102 a barrel.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 112.10 points, or 0.9%, at 12582.18, off 5.1% this
year. One of the Dow's weakest components was American International Group, which slid 4% ahead of its
fourth-quarter earnings report, reflecting investors' persistent worries about the fallout to come from financial
firms' bad bets on mortgage securities.
Treasury bonds posted solid gains as investors sought safe havens. The two-year note rose 8/32, or $2.50
for each $1,000 invested, to yield 1.876%, its lowest yield in nearly four years. The 30-year bond jumped 1
17/32, $15.31 for each $1,000 invested, lowering its yield to 4.554%.
The dollar sank to another record low against the euro and gold hit its 14th record this year, at $964.50 per
troy ounce.
Wrapping up two days of congressional testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reminded
investors of possible risks remaining in the financial sector. He said some small banks could yet fail because
of the recent housing crunch.
Mr. Bernanke emphasized that major financial firms are financially sound, but that provided little comfort to
investors.
"What's the definition of a 'small' firm?" said Anthony Conroy, head trader at BNY ConvergEx Group, a New
York brokerage. Alluding to relationships Wall Street firms have as buyers and sellers in one another's credit
trades, he added: "Everyone is intertwined. If one of these things fails, it could affect someone else's balance
sheet."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which has a heavy weighting of financial stocks, tumbled 0.9%, or
12.34 points, to 1367.68, down 6.9% this year. It was hurt by a decline of 2.9% in its financial sector and a
2.6% drop in its consumer-discretionary sector, which often suffers when rising oil prices indicate that
Americans will be spending more at the pump.
Oil prices skyrocketed $2.95, or 3%, to a $102.59 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a new
record in nominal terms and just below its inflation-adjusted record of $103.76 set in 1980. News of unrest in
Nigeria raised supply concerns, while demand seemed poised to rise amid a burst of cold weather in the
Northeast. Oil futures have risen 12% just this month and 65% in the past 12 months.
Gasoline and heating-oil futures also rose.
The broader commodity sector also continued to rally, flirting with new records that kept investors mindful of
the potential for inflation. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index jumped 1.9%, or 4.015 points, to a record
216.704.
Analysts said commodity prices got a boost from a falling dollar. Whenever the greenback weakens, foreign
commodity users who need raw materials to make finished goods must spend more dollars to obtain the
same amount of raw materials.

Fannie Mae Alchemy
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Fannie Mae Alchemy

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lost lots of money last quarter and last year -- and we mean lots. If they
continue losing money at current rates, in fact, they could find themselves below their mandatory capital
requirements in another six months or so.
Fannie and Freddie think that the best way to deal with this problem is to allow them to leverage up even
further by reducing those same capital requirements. Some on Capitol Hill, notably New York Democrat
Chuck Schumer, agree. Like maxed-out consumers who were about to reach their credit limit, Fannie and
Freddie already hit up investors for a cool $13.8 billion in additional capital last quarter. But as they continue
to lose money, their capital position remains tenuous.
So now, with the help of Senator Schumer and other friends on the Hill, they're trying to get their credit limits
raised. Like political alchemists, they want to turn their losses into the gold of more profit-making
opportunities. James Lockhart, the regulator responsible for Fannie and Freddie, gave them a bit of relief this
week by eliminating caps on the size of their investment portfolios, and their stock prices jumped. Now the
pressure is also on Mr. Lockhart to lower their capital requirements, but nothing about their results suggests
that Fannie and Freddie need more risk in their lives -- or ours.
The two government-sponsored mortgage giants lost $6.1 billion between them in the fourth quarter. In both
cases, the lion's share of the reported losses came from losses on derivatives that the companies use to
hedge their huge portfolios of mortgage-backed securities, or MBSs. Supposedly, we are to take some
comfort from this. The companies contend that these are paper losses and that the price of derivatives can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter or year to year. That's true.
But bear in mind why Fan and Fred buy these derivatives in the first place. Each of them has an MBS
portfolio worth more than $700 billion on its books. These portfolios are entirely separate from their original
mandate, which was to buy mortgages from banks, package them into securities and sell them to investors
with a guarantee. Both companies still do this too, of course, and the recent turmoil in the housing market has
allowed them to greatly expand their market share in that business. But these days they make more money
(on an "operating basis," at least) by holding mortgages or MBSs for their own account, or by buying MBSs
on the open market and holding them.
To do that, they borrow. A lot. In fact, almost every dollar they invest in MBSs is a dollar they borrow by
issuing bonds. This they can do cheaply because of a market perception that, if loss comes to shove, Uncle
Sam will make their creditors whole. The two companies then make money off the spread between their
borrowing rates and the interest paid by the mortgage holder or the mortgage-backed security.
To make sure that spread stays positive, and hence profitable, they then purchase interest-rate swaps and
other derivatives to hedge their exposure to changes in interest rates. And in the fourth quarter in particular,
Fannie and Freddie saw huge declines in the value of those derivatives as interest rates fell. It may be that
those losses will never get realized or that the value of the derivatives will recover.
But in the meantime, Fannie and Freddie continue to bleed capital. In the fourth quarter, Freddie raised $6
billion and Fannie $7.8 billion in preferred-stock offerings. And it's a good thing they did, because without that
capital last quarter's losses would have put both companies below the minimum capital levels required by
their regulator. Fannie's capital base stands $3.9 billion above the minimum, while Freddie has a cushion of
$3.5 billion.
That doesn't sound too, too bad, maybe. Except that Freddie is holding $100 billion in subprime asset-backed
securities in its portfolio while Fannie has $74 billion or so. It wouldn't take too much in the way of portfolio
losses to wipe out those capital cushions. How likely are further write-downs? Well, 21% of Freddie's $100
billion in subprime assets are 60 days delinquent or more, and 40% of those securities on watch for
downgrade.

So, what in the world is Congress doing? Mr. Schumer cheered Wednesday when Mr. Lockhart lifted the
caps on the companies's portfolios. We guess he thinks that what we really need is more taxpayer exposure
to the risk of a meltdown at Fan and Fred. Meanwhile, the reform bill passed by the House last year is stalled
in the Senate Banking Committee, thanks in part to Democrats like Mr. Schumer. This is the bill that would
strengthen the regulator's power to make sure the two giants stay solvent.
What Fannie and Freddie really need is a regulator with the clout to cut up their credit cards before they get
into even deeper trouble -- and take the rest of us along with them.

The Bernanke Reflation
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Bernanke Reflation
828 words
29 February 2008
The Wall Street Journal

Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
For readers under age 30 who are wondering why they are suddenly paying $3.15 for gasoline and $2 for
milk, the answer is that this is what an inflation looks like. Those of us of a certain age remember it well, if
painfully, and judging by the noises coming from the Federal Reserve of late we had all better get used to it
again.
First, Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn declared that, while inflation was worrisome, the Fed now views
recession as the more urgent danger to fight. Then on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told
Congress that the Fed will do whatever it takes to stop the credit squeeze from becoming a recession. That's
about as close as a central banker will get to saying that he's thrown price stability to the wind. If inflation
rises -- as it now surely will -- then the Fed will worry about that later, after the economy is safely past the
credit crunch.
Right on cue, the best indicators of inflation expectations hit new highs. Oil has surged past the once
astronomical $100 mark and is now $102 a barrel; as recently as September, it was $70. Gold is nearly $975
an ounce, and the $1,000 threshold seems inevitable. The euro has broken $1.50 for the first time, while
commodity prices in general are hitting record highs. These increases will roll through the rest of the economy
and lift prices for food, energy, and countless other goods and services.
Call it the Bernanke reflation, though it's more precise to call it the Fed's second inflation gamble of the
decade. The first was Alan Greenspan's roll of the dice from 2003-2005, keeping interest rates too low for far
too long in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. That spurred the first boom in commodity prices, as well as the
subsidy for debt that led to the housing bubble and the credit mania whose collapse we are now dealing with.
Mr. Bernanke was a Fed Governor during much of that time, and he seems to have learned his lessons all
too well. He's now going all-in for round two.
Naturally, the Fed and its most vocal constituencies -- Wall Street and politicians -- see nothing much to
worry about. Wall Street sees a reflation as a way to ease its credit problems, as price increases ease debt
burdens and perhaps reflate housing values. Congress and the White House see a way to perhaps avoid a
near-term recession, which might get them past the election.
As for the Fed, its Governors are dusting off their favorite intellectual justifications. We are told that inflation
isn't as bad as it seems because "core inflation" -- which excludes food and energy prices -- isn't rising as
fast as the consumer price index. However, food and energy are what most Americans are having to spend
ever more of their paycheck to buy. Thus the Bernanke reflation is in part self-refuting even as a short-term
recession antidote, because it robs consumers of some of their discretionary income just when the economy
needs it.
Meanwhile, even the Phillips Curve is making a comeback. That's the notion -- popular before it was
discredited in the 1970s -- that there is a trade-off between inflation and economic growth. In its new version,
argued by Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin, the Phillips Curve doesn't exist in the long term but does in the
short term. Thus the Fed can afford to open the monetary flood gates now because the slower economy
could lead to lower prices later this year. Then when the economy recovers, the Fed can afford to tighten
money again.
This is a beguiling intellectual construct, but it puts a great deal of weight on Fed Governors to know when to
tighten again. They were supposed to do something similar in 2003-2005, but they were terribly wrong. Then
as now they were also dismissing such forward-looking price signals as gold and oil and instead focusing on
such misleading indicators as "core inflation" and the money supply. Mr. Mishkin may be seen as a
monetary wizard at the Fed, but to investors around the world he is beginning to look more like a high-class
inflationist.

The people who aren't being fooled by all this are the American people. They don't pay their bills with "core"
dollar bills, and they know those dollars buy less with each passing month. This explains their rising economic
anxiety -- and anger -- better than trade or job losses do, especially since the job market has remained
relatively healthy. Inflation is the great thief of the middle class, as even Americans who don't recall the
1970s are learning. With its all-in reflation bet, the Bernanke Fed is gambling with their money.

Gold Touches All-Time High --- Economic Worries And Weaker Dollar Bolster Metal's Rise

Gold Touches All-Time High --- Economic Worries And Weaker Dollar Bolster Metal's Rise

Gold and crude-oil futures touched all-time highs on economic worries and dollar weakness, but only gold
managed to retain its sparkle yesterday.
Other commodities such as copper, coffee and cocoa also rose, supported by gold's strength and investor
interest in tangible assets as a hedge against inflation.
Nearby February gold rose $12.10 to settle at $958.20 after setting a record front-month high of $960
overnight on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most-active April gold rose $12.10 to
$961 an ounce after hitting a contract high $967.70 overnight.
In addition to a weaker dollar and oil prices hovering around $100 a barrel, the yellow metal found support as
durable goods and home sales came in lower than expected, said Carlos Sanchez, precious-metals analyst
with CPM Group.
Sales of single-family homes decreased by 2.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 588,000, while
economists had forecast January sales at an annual rate of 600,000. Another report yesterday showed orders
for durable goods fell 5.3% in January to a seasonally adjusted $212.8 billion. Wall Street had expected a
smaller, 4% decrease.
Nymex crude oil established an all-time nominal intraday high of $102.08 a barrel, lifted by an influx of
investment funds concerned about a weakening dollar and rising inflation. The rally was undercut after data
from the U.S. Department of Energy showed larger-than-expected increases in crude and gasoline stockpiles
and weakening oil demand. U.S. gasoline inventories now stand at their highest level in 14 years. Light,
sweet crude for April delivery settled $1.24, or 1.2%, lower at $99.64 a barrel.
"Today, the market decided it was going to focus on its fundamentals, which have been bearish for the last
couple of weeks," said Andy Lebow, senior vice president for energy at brokerage MF Global in New York.
Some support for commodities, particularly gold, came from comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke. He delivered an economic forecast fraught with risks from housing, labor and credit markets,
suggesting policy makers remain on track to lower interest rates further next month.
Mr. Bernanke's testimony "pointing to further rate cuts" provided support for the yellow metal, said Patrick
Fearon, precious-metals analyst with A.G. Edwards.
Investor interest in commodities as a whole has risen, especially as the Fed appears more focused on
supporting a faltering U.S. economy than fighting rising prices.
Much of that demand is coming from hedge funds as well as big commodity, managed and exchange-traded
funds, says Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path Trading.
"These funds have just been buying the basket of commodities," Mr. Lesh said.
Gold's high prices themselves are also exacerbating the metal's volatility.
"Having no previous technical indicators, it's trying to find that support and resistance as gold trades at these
levels and fluctuates around," Mr. Sanchez said.

Markets on Tear: Wheat, Oil, Euro --- Stocks Hold Up Well Despite $100 Crude, Latest Housing Worry
Tuesday's Markets
Markets on Tear: Wheat, Oil, Euro --- Stocks Hold Up Well Despite $100 Crude, Latest Housing Worry

Downbeat reports about the economy sent the dollar to a record low against the euro -- even as stocks
shrugged off the bad news, and a rally in crude oil past $100 a barrel, to close higher.
The dollar's weakness came on new signs of distress in the housing market and a higher-than-expected
increase in wholesale inflation.
"The dollar is clearly feeling the brunt of a pessimistic view on the U.S. economy," said John McCarthy,
manager of currency trading at ING Financial Markets. One euro briefly fetched more than $1.50, a record,
late yesterday, after trading at $1.4966 as of the 4 p.m. close for stocks.
Stock investors remained focused on feel-good stories. The latest came from International Business
Machines, which announced a stock-buyback plan valued at as much as to $15 billion and raised its
earnings-per-share forecast accordingly.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 114.70 points, or 0.9%, to 12684.92, putting the blue-chip measure in
positive territory so far in February, up 0.3%. Among the Dow's components, IBM jumped 3.9% and helped to
fuel a technology rally. Intel rose 3.8%, and Microsoft rose 1.9%.
The tech-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.8% to 2344.99.
The gloomy U.S. economic news contrasted with Europe, where German business confidence showed an
unexpected rise earlier in the day. The divergence helped shake the dollar out of a trading range against the
euro that has been in place since late November.
Behind the currency movements are the vastly different approaches adopted by the U.S. and European
central banks over an uncertain economic outlook. European policy makers have remained focused on risks
from inflation and have held key interest rates steady. The Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates in a
bid to stimulate economic growth and seems ready to do so again.
That has increased pressure on the dollar, because lower interest rates make short-term dollar deposits less
attractive. The dollar's fate will depend partly on whether investors believe Europe will share in U.S. economic
ills -- and whether its central bank, too, will be compelled to cut interest rates. Some economists say they
believe the European Central Bank might moderate its economic growth forecasts as soon as next month.
Even as IBM's news attracted buyers to the stock market, investors overlooked several other pessimistic
developments, including a surge that took crude-oil prices back above the psychologically important
$100-a-barrel level. Crude-oil futures gained $1.65, or 1.7%, to an exchange-record $100.88 a barrel in New
York amid speculative buying and supply concerns sparked by renewed unrest in Nigeria and Iraq.
Although the market shrugged off crude's rise, most companies might suffer if the rally lasts. Consumers'
spending power might be sapped as they pay more at the pump, diverting money from purchases that
generate most companies' profits.
Another source of anxiety for U.S. consumers: falling home prices. The S&P/Case Schiller home-price index
showed home prices fell 8.9% in fourth quarter of 2007.
Analysts said the stock rally fits the pattern of the last few sessions. The Dow has now rallied for three
straight trading days, leaping 3.3%, or more than 400 points, amid a steady stream of mixed news. It is down
4.4% this year.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.7%, or 9.49 points, to 1381.29. All of its sectors gained, led by
the financial wing, which got a boost when Moody's Investors Service confirmed its top-tier credit ratings of
bond insurer MBIA. The S&P is down 5.9% in 2008.
Optimists say they are looking ahead to a potential recovery.
"If you think that we're going to have an economic pickup in the second half of the year, now is the time to be
looking for opportunities in the market," said Michael Cuggino, president and portfolio manager for Permanent
Portfolio Family of Funds in San Francisco.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said in a speech that risks to economic growth
were more of a threat than inflation and that the Fed was ready to respond to "difficult times," language that
many traders interpreted as a sign of interest-rate cuts to come.
The prospect of lower rates helped push down the greenback. Meanwhile, the economic data from Germany
"highlight the divergence with the U.S." and delay possible interest-rate cuts by the European Central Bank,
said Robert Sinche, head of global currency strategy at Bank of America.
The dollar's weakness contributed to a rise in gold. Gold futures for February delivery gained $8.50 to
$946.10 an ounce in New York, matching their recent record on Feb.21.

Fannie, Freddie
May Show
It's 'Prime' Time
Forget subprime.
As the housing market continues to fall apart, more woes are hitting mortgage loans to homeowners with
solid credit records. That has troubling implications for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which purchase and
guarantee a wide variety of home mortgages, mostly prime.
Fannie is slated to report financial results today, Freddie tomorrow. Analysts will be looking for signs of
problems in their more-credit-worthy loan portfolios. As of December, 2.2% of all prime mortgages were at
least 60 days past due, up from 1.5% a year earlier, and the highest level since 1998, according to First
American CoreLogic. More than one-fifth of subprime loans were 60 days or more past due. A check of
delinquency rates for large, high-quality mortgages shows that "credit quality is now deteriorating sharply
even for prime mortgages," Morgan Stanley analyst Kenneth Posner wrote in a recent research note
reiterating a negative outlook on Fannie. Delinquency and foreclosure rates for jumbo loans in December
were more than double the previous January.
Friedman Billings Ramsey analysts expect delinquencies on Fannie Mae's single-family credit book to rise as
high as 1.5% in the next few months from the current 0.9%, already well above historic levels.
One growing problem: More homeowners have an incentive to default as property values drop, and they owe
more on their mortgages than the home is worth. Yesterday the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed that home
prices in 10 major metropolitan areas fell 8.9% in the fourth quarter from the previous year, the biggest drop
in the index's 20-year history.
The decline in home prices leaves $1.75 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding under water, according to
Moody's Economy.com. With roughly $1 trillion in subprime mortgages outstanding, that means a large slice
of prime loans, as well as Alt-A -- a category between prime and subprime -- is mired in what economists call
"negative equity."
It adds up to a big negative for homeowners -- and for Fannie and Freddie.
Bernanke's Unenviable Spot:
Inflation, Recession, the Hill
The camera lights on Capitol Hill may feel especially hot to Ben Bernanke today.
The Federal Reserve chairman will deliver his semiannual testimony on monetary policy to the House
Financial Services Committee just as almost everything under his direct purview seems to be moving in the
wrong direction. Despite his interest-rate cuts, the economy is slowing and long-term fixed-mortgage rates
are rising.
Meanwhile, inflation fears are bubbling. Crude oil, gold and wheat are at or near record highs. The dollar is
at a record low against the euro. The Labor Department yesterday reported the biggest 12-month surge in
producer prices since October 1981. And 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities yesterday priced in
a 2.46% annual increase in the consumer-price index over the next 10 years, up from about 2.2% a month

ago and near the highest levels of 2007, according to Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller
Tabak.
Yesterday, Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn dismissed inflation concerns and said the Fed will fight
recession by any means necessary. But central bankers will now have to think long and hard before cutting
rates aggressively again.

State-Run Funds See Gold --- As Profits Increase, Investors Pour Cash Into Commodities

State-Run Funds See Gold --- As Profits Increase, Investors Pour Cash Into Commodities

LONDON -- With juicy profits from rising exports of raw materials, government-run funds in Asia and the
Middle East are now investing billions of dollars directly into crude oil, copper and other commodities in a
development that could reshape markets globally.
Total commodity investments by what are known as sovereign-wealth funds are around 1% of the funds' total
assets of nearly $3 trillion -- an average based on estimates by Morgan Stanley, Global Insight and other
analysts. That amounts to a sizable $30 billion worth of state funds in commodities, up from a fraction of that
amount five years ago.
But state-run fund investments in energy, agricultural and other commodity markets are expected to get even
bigger due to rapid economic growth in China, Saudi Arabia and other emerging markets and related high
commodity prices.
Sovereign-wealth fund commodity investments, which are also aimed at diversifying funds' investments, are
expanding trends started by U.S. and European private-equity groups, secretive hedge funds and even
pension funds, which have piled into commodities the past few years amid the run-up in raw-material prices.
A commodity favorite among a number of state-run funds has been gold, which investors have traditionally
used to defend against rising inflation and a weaker U.S. dollar.
Middle East funds have a particular appetite for gold because of rising prices and the declining value of the
dollar, to which many Gulf countries peg their currencies. Gold futures yesterday rose $8.50 per troy ounce,
or 0.9%, to $946.10 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange -- matching the recent
Comex record, hit on Feb. 21.
Total sovereign-wealth fund assets are forecast to quadruple to around $12 trillion by 2015, making the funds
the biggest grouping of investors in the world, according to U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.
"We've seen more and more investments by sovereign-wealth funds into commodities, like gold, and we're
still at an early stage," says Boris Shrayer, head of investor coverage and strategy for commodities at Morgan
Stanley.
But the financial muscle of state-run investment funds may pose new challenges for market participants and
regulators because it opens the prospect of state funds moving prices in futures markets like corn or copper,
which are much smaller relative to more capitalized markets like crude oil.
Similar to many individual and corporate investors, sovereign-wealth funds are mainly investing in
commodities through exchange-traded funds, which offer investors exposure to a commodity like gold or
wheat without accepting the delivery of products.
Commodity investments can also be a double-edged sword for state-run funds. Some countries, like China,
are big commodity producers and consumers and also fork out a lot of cash to import large quantities of
products such as coal and copper. Being too aggressive with their investments could contribute to higher
prices for a given commodity and push up a country's import bill.
In other trading yesterday:
WHEAT: Futures closed mostly higher, as the markets continue to focus on short supplies of spring wheat,
traded at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. March MGE wheat fell $1.60 to $22.40 a bushel, while
most-active May wheat gained $1.35 to close at $18.4325.

CRUDE OIL: Futures soared to a new high of $100.88 on the Nymex yesterday, up $1.65, amid continued
weakness in the U.S. dollar and growing concerns about inflation. Yesterday's surge in oil prices was also
supported by concerns that tension in Nigeria and Iraq could disrupt oil supplies.

Inflation May Be Worse Than We Think
Inflation May Be Worse Than We Think

Amid Wall Street's recession panic, the latest official inflation news has received less attention than usual.
The "headline" consumer price index (CPI) for the year ending in January was up 4.3%, the third consecutive
monthly reading above 4%. This has been easy to attribute to rising energy costs, for which the blame is
often misplaced on foreigners and oil companies. But as I've argued on this page in the past, the real problem
is the sick dollar.
The "core" CPI that excludes energy and food shows a 12-month rise of 2.5%. Though higher than the
Federal Reserve's so-called comfort zone, that's not yet dramatic enough to dominate the headlines -- or to
hold the Fed back from responding to the pain that its primary constituency, the banking community, is going
through. Reinforced by intense pressure from Congress, the banking panic has compelled the Fed to take its
eye off inflation. Rates have been reduced by more than two percentage points, and more cuts are
expected.
While the practice of excluding energy and food costs to glimpse the "underlying" rate of inflation meets a lot
of skepticism, the official consumer-price picture still keeps everyone guessing. The root of the confusion is
the fact that the prices consumers actually pay change far more quickly than the CPI.
The CPI utilizes what is, in effect, a form of historical cost accounting. Its shelter component, which carries
the greatest weight, is designed to reflect the average monthly cost to households who moved into their living
space at a wide range of times dating many years back in the past. Other components are based on price
"menus" published by retailers or fees set by public authorities, neither of which changes frequently. In the
financial markets, only prices from recent transactions would provide timely information. But government
agencies are comfortable with cheaper and backward-looking data.
The most timely figures come from the commodity markets, where prices are transparent and reflect
conditions in the immediate present. Yet commentators tend to discount volatile data like energy and food
prices when they assess the "underlying" rate of inflation. This is a big mistake.
Markets look forward, while government surveys of the cost of living are a rearview mirror. A little "indicator
analysis" shows that commodity prices, far from reverting quickly back to the mean, are early-warning
indicators of the future CPI. Last year's large increases in energy and food imply that consumer-price
inflation is going to be much closer to today's "headline" rate of 4.3% than the "core" rate of 2.5%.
Why does this matter? The accompanying graph shows how rapidly the purchasing power of income declines
from an ongoing inflation of 4%. (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ February 27, 2008) After nine years,
an income of $100,000 is worth only $70,000. After 17 years its purchasing power has been cut in half, and
after 30 years by about 70%.
The cumulative loss of purchasing power if inflation persists above 4% is an awesome prospect that is surely
going to be unacceptable. When the Fed gets its eye back on the inflation ball, a return to higher interest
rates will not be far behind.
But worse may be yet to come. While commodities like energy and food are leading indicators of the CPI,
precious metals like gold are, in turn, leading indicators of energy and food. It's sobering to note that
precious-metals prices this year are running more than 30% ahead of where they were a year ago. The
situation evokes one of Johnny Cash's songs, "Five Feet High and Rising."
Historically, CPI inflation is more closely related to prior changes in the price of gold than most people
realize. The correlation is obscured by great differences in short-term behavior -- the price of gold is
notoriously volatile, while the CPI is very slow-moving. It's therefore necessary to take account of gold-price
changes over a multi-year time frame.

--- Page 157 ---
Page 157 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
There is a remarkable parallel between annual CPI inflation and the cumulative change in the price of gold
measured from eight years before. A similar graph could be plotted for silver, and the parallel can also be
seen in cross-section by comparing countries over time with varying degrees of currency instability.
Historical CPI data in the U.S. are complicated by occasional changes in the methodology the government
uses to calculate the index. In the late 1990s, one of these changes reduced the reported inflation rate
significantly. But taken as a whole, the relationship suggests my following rule of thumb to estimate CPI
inflation at any time: Divide the percentage change in the gold price from eight years in the past by 80, and
add three. This rule of thumb has largely worked over the past several decades. In the last eight years the
price of gold has risen 225%. The rule therefore comes out with an answer that puts inflation a lot closer to
6% than 4%.
Commodity prices provide what may be the most pertinent information for anticipating how high CPI inflation
is going to get. Even if the gold boom suddenly ends, which I doubt it will, 4% inflation looks very much on
the low side. Higher ground, anyone?

Treasurys Turn Back After Morning Rally
Credit Markets
Treasurys Turn Back After Morning Rally

Treasurys were hammered in late-session trading as U.S. stocks turned around and following a hawkish
warning about inflation risks from Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher.
The selloff Friday accelerated after CNBC reported that a bailout of financial guarantor Ambac Financial
Group Inc. could be announced early next week, easing some concern about subprime-mortgage turmoil that
has haunted the markets since last summer.
As investors dumped government debt to get into equities, the two- and 10-year sectors ended the week on a
down note, giving up a rally in the morning session.
Mr. Fisher, in an interview with Bloomberg News, said he is hearing increasing expressions of concern about
inflation from executives, which has "gotten my attention." He also said the U.S. probably will see slower
economic growth rather than a deeper downturn.
Mr. Fisher, who is a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, voted against the
Fed's half-percentage-point interest-rate cut Jan. 30 due to concerns about inflation and a belief the Fed's
prior actions would be sufficient to get the economy back on its feet.
Worries over inflation have moved to the front burner after a higher-than-expected consumer price index
Wednesday, and as crude oil and gold set records. A weak dollar also added to the worries as it pushed up
import prices.
"Fisher really hit the market's nerve. His comments play into people's fear of inflation," said T.J. Marta,
fixed-income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Inflation eats into the returns on fixed-income
securities. "The Fed is basically fighting a two-front war with one weapon, and that isn't a good recipe."
Treasurys had benefited earlier as U.S. stocks initially tumbled amid worries about recession risks. That
helped bonds extend their rally Thursday after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's manufacturing
gauge signaled the economy may be contracting.
Speculation that more financial guarantors may be downgraded also added to the buying in Treasurys,
traders said. Downgrades on credit ratings of these insurers will lead to downgrades of the corporate and
municipal bonds they guarantee, which may lead to a chain reaction in the broader credit markets.
"The subprime situation is far from over. It is like a big dark cloud hanging over the markets," said Bill
Strazzullo, chief market strategist at financial advisory firm Bell Curve Trading in Freehold, N.J.
The 10-year Treasury note Friday fell 2/32 point, or 62.5 cents per $1,000 face value, at 97 20/32. Its yield
rose to 3.790% from 3.782% Thursday, as yields move inversely to prices. The 30-year bond was down
16/32 point at 96 20/32 to yield 4.583%, up from 4.552%.
CIFG Put on Watch
Moody's Investors Service Friday put small financial guarantor CIFG Guaranty on watch for a possible
downgrade because of its exposure to risky mortgages and uncertainty about the company's direction.
The review of the top-notch triple-A rating will be resolved in two weeks, Moody's said. Four financial
guarantors already have been stripped of their triple-A ratings by at least one of the three major rating firms,
and others are on review for downgrades, as securities they insure that are related to subprime mortgages
continue to lose value.

--- Page 159 ---
Page 159 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
CIFG's parent companies, French financial institutions Caisse Nationale des Caisses d'Epargne and Banque
Federale des Banques Populaires, put $1.5 billion into CIFG in December, but the firm's capital cushion has
now fallen below the benchmark for a triple-A rating, Moody's said. CIFG has insured $94.7 billion of
outstanding bonds, the bulk of which are products related to subprime mortgages.

Earnings Digest: Sale of Mine Stake May Strengthen Rio's Hand

Rio Tinto PLC said it would sell its stake in a U.S. gold mine for $1.7 billion, in a deal that could help the giant
mining conglomerate make its case that a takeover offer it faces from BHP Billiton is too low.
Barrick Gold paid well above the $600 million or so that analysts had expected Rio Tinto's 40% stake in its
Cortez Hills, Nev., operation would fetch. The outcome bodes well for Rio's efforts to dispose of a total of $10
billion of assets in 2008, and may bolster the company's case that its assets are undervalued. Rio has twice
rejected buyout offers from BHP, the latest of 3.4 BHP shares for each Rio share.
The news came on a day that included a mixed bag of earnings reports from gold producers and another
jump in gold prices. Barrick and another miner, Goldcorp, reported higher fourth-quarter net income, the
latter aided by a prior-year write-down, but Newmont Mining Corp. swung to a loss on a $1.12 billion
write-down of its reserves.
Barrick reported net income of $537 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $418 million, or 48 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue grew 42% to $1.92 billion.
Barrick's gold production fell 12% as costs per ounce rose 31%. Copper production rose 1%, while costs slid
1%. The Toronto-based company's realized price increased 28% for gold and 2.2% for copper.
The company expects 2008 gold production of 7.6 million to 8.1 million ounces, versus 2007's 8.06 million
ounces and copper production of between 380 million pounds and 400 million pounds, down from last year's
402 million pounds. Costs are expected to be higher than 2007 owing to "higher energy costs," among other
reasons.
Newmont, the world's second-largest gold miner behind Barrick, reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $289
million, or 63 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $223 million, or 49 cents a share.
The company said the $1.12 billion write-down was the result of a "new industry-developed" interpretation of
impairment analysis of "recent reserve-replacement results." Results also included a $900 million gain on the
sale of its merchant-banking unit and other assets. Revenue slipped 1% to $1.41 billion.
Newmont's gold sales fell. Copper sales were cut nearly in half to $121 million. The Denver-based
company's cost of gold production rose 19%, while realized prices rose 29%.
Canadian miner Goldcorp said net income hit US$256.6 million, or 36 cents a share, up from $66 million, or
11 cents a share, a year earlier. That period included a $174.7 million write-down on mining interests.
Revenue jumped 42% to $679.8 million.
Production rose 9% to a record 638,900 ounces of gold. The company's costs increased 22% to $195 an
ounce, primarily from the strength of the Canadian dollar.
Lightly traded but nearby February gold settled at $946.10 per troy ounce on the Comex division of the New
York Mercantile Exchange, up $11.50, or 1.2%, amid worries about inflation and even possible "stagflation."
The metal closed at its 12th record of the year. It has gained 13% so far this year. The most-active April
contract settled at $949.20 up $11.40, or 1.2%.

Precious and base metals soared, with gold and platinum touching records and copper hitting a 19-month
peak on the weakness of the dollar and a host of other factors.
Precious metals were also lifted by worries about inflation and continuing credit-market jitters. Platinum
remained underpinned by power-supply shortages in South Africa that are reducing mining output at a time
when demand is strong.
"You've got pretty good fund buying in gold, silver, platinum and palladium," said George Gero, vice
president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
Nearby February gold gained $11.50 to $946.10 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange and reached a peak of $953.40. That is a spot-month record.
Oil futures topped $100 a barrel this week before retreating yesterday, reinforcing worries about inflation, Mr.
Gero said. That supports gold because investors often buy it as a hedge against rising prices.
Several analysts cited fears of possible "stagflation," the combination of inflation and stagnant consumer
demand that occurred in the 1970s and helped send gold to the record highs in 1980 that stood until last
month.
"We're going to continue to see the Fed reducing rates because they are going to try to prevent the economy
from going into recession, if we're not already in one," said David Beahm, vice president with Blanchard & Co.
This comes as recent inflation data have been rising, along with commodity prices.
While it is "a little premature to say whether we're experiencing stagflation," Mr. Beahm said, investors are
"looking for something to grab onto" and thus are turning to precious metals.
Also, further rate cuts could portend more dollar weakness that helps gold, Mr. Beahm said. Market
participants often buy the metal as a hedge against dollar weakness. Furthermore, a weaker U.S. currency
contributes to inflation, Mr. Gero said.
April platinum rose $49.40 to $2,188.20 an ounce and hit a Nymex record high $2,194.80.
Meanwhile, copper was lifted by the soft dollar, declining inventories and ideas that emerging markets could
provide more demand than previously thought.
Nearby Comex February copper rose 10.5 cents a pound to $3.8105 a pound, peaking at $3.8125, the
highest front-month price since July 2006.
Inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses, watched as a gauge of supply tightness, fell to 135,375
metric tons from 200,975 metric tons Jan. 8.
Eric Wittenauer, an analyst with A.G. Edwards, sees growing emerging-market demand as a trend that will
continue.
"I think that generally speaking that's where the majority of demand -- and particularly demand growth -- lies,
in developing nations, particularly China," Mr. Wittenauer said.
In other markets:
COFFEE: Futures rose, supported by speculative buying and strength in London's robusta market, which
touched 11-year highs. Speculative buying and limited selling by Vietnamese coffee producers -- the world's

largest producers of robusta coffee -- have lifted prices recently. The ICE Futures U.S. March arabica coffee
contract gained 1.75 cents to $1.5635 a pound.
CRUDE OIL: Futures settled lower for the first time since Feb. 12 after the release of U.S. data showing an
increase in crude-oil and gasoline inventories last week pulled oil back from $100. On its first day trading as
the front-month contract, light, sweet crude for April delivery settled $1.47, or 1.5%, lower at $98.23 on the
Nymex.

Dow Industrials Tumble 142.96 Points

A sharp drop in oil prices hammered U.S. energy stocks and failed to provide the usual boost for other
sectors, as a dismal reading on factory activity from the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia branch renewed
investors' worries about recession.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 142.96 points, or 1.2%, at 12284.30, down 7.4% so
far this year. Exxon Mobil was off 1.3%, and Chevron fell 1.8%.
The blue-chip average was up more than 75 points early in the day. The swoon began when the Philadelphia
Fed said its business activity index, a measure of regional manufacturing, skidded to its lowest reading since
2001, below analysts' expectations. The report returned attention to the duration and severity of a possible
recession in the U.S.
"Most folks who were in denial about our being in a recession in the first place have now come over to the
dark side," said Jon Najarian, an independent trader and founder of OptionMonster.com, a Chicago research
firm. "It's just a question of what kind of recession we'll have."
Like many Wall Street pros, Mr. Najarian believes the U.S. economy will experience a relatively mild
downturn this year, lasting two or three quarters, when the stock market may be able to hold steady.
But some are looking for a more dire outcome. In a research note, Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg
warned that the Philadelphia Fed data signaled the economy could be headed into a deeper recession, akin
to the one it suffered in 1990, which continued into the following year.
Meanwhile, inflation remained a concern. Gold, benefiting from its historic role as an alternative store of
financial value when confidence is waning in paper currency, soared to its 12th record this year on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, up $11.50 a troy ounce to $946.10. Several analysts cited
fears of possible "stagflation," the combination of inflation and recession that occurred in the 1970s.
Other commodities also gained as rising recession fears hurt the dollar. Because most commodities trade in
dollars, a weaker dollar drives up prices. Silver rose to its highest level since December 1990, up 21% this
year. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index was up 0.6%, or 1.281 points, at a record 206.687.
But crude-oil futures, after fueling inflation worries with record prices topping $100 a barrel, fell $1.47 to
$98.23 a barrel on the Nymex. Traders said oil was hurt by a weekly rise in U.S. inventories and investors'
scramble to roll their bets to April futures from the recently expired March contracts. Oil is still ahead 2.3% so
far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 1.3%, or 17.50 points, at 1342.53, led by a decline of nearly
3% in its energy sector. The S&P is off 8.6% this year.
As investors sought safe havens, prices for Treasury soared. The 30-year bond leapt 1 14/32, or $14.38 per
$1,000 invested, lowering its yield to 4.552%. The two-year note gained 8/32 to yield 1.993%.

Crude Sticks Above $100 On Speculators' Activity

Crude Sticks Above $100 On Speculators' Activity

Crude-oil futures reached a record high for the second straight session, remaining above $100 a barrel.
Trading was volatile ahead of yesterday's expiration of the front-month contract for benchmark crude on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light, sweet crude for March delivery settled up 73 cents at $100.74 a barrel, while the more-heavily traded
April Nymex contract was unchanged at $99.70 a barrel.
After a two-week-long run-up fueled largely by supply concerns, prices rose as speculative money flooded the
market.
"The funds are buying into this," said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures, a commodities broker in
Huntington Beach, Calif. With the expiration of the March contract, "the market becomes extremely volatile,"
he added.
Helping propel prices was the release of Federal Reserve minutes revealing concern about economic risks.
The dollar fell on the news.
"The Fed minutes certainly implied more rate cuts, which could lead to further deterioration of the dollar and,
obviously, increased value for crude contracts," said Mike Fitzpatrick, an analyst at brokerage MF Global in
New York.
While the April contract ended unchanged, it clawed back from earlier lows, suggesting crude's recent price
strength may endure. March crude hit a record intraday high of $101.32 a barrel, which "will now provide an
upside target to April values," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of trading-advisory firm Ritterbusch and
Associates in Galena, Ill.
Yet crude's strength in the absence of new developments suggesting a tighter supply and demand balance
led some to question the rally's longevity.
In a weekly report, MasterCard Advisors LLC, a division of MasterCard Inc., revealed data showing that U.S.
gasoline demand in the week ended Feb. 15 was 4.4% below a year ago, the fourth consecutive year-to-year
decline and the biggest since the end of December.
Analysts also expect U.S. oil stockpiles to have grown for the sixth straight week in government data due out
today, which could weigh on oil prices.
The market's willingness to keep oil aloft could complicate matters for the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries when producers meet March 5.
In other commodity markets:
SILVER: Strength in crude oil and gold lifted silver prices to a life-of-contract high of $17.79 an ounce. March
silver on the Comex division of Nymex rose 25.2 cents to settle at $17.76.
ORANGE JUICE: Prices rose, rebounding after a recent sell-off, after frozen concentrated orange-juice
futures found support at key technical-chart points. ICE Futures U.S. FCOJ March futures gained 2.40 cents
to $1.2465 a pound.

Dow, up 90.04, Shrugs Off Inflation

Dow, up 90.04, Shrugs Off Inflation

Stocks recovered from early losses to end the day higher, as the market brushed aside reports of stubborn
inflation pressures that may complicate the Federal Reserve's ability to cut interest rates.
Down more than 100 points during the day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 90.04 points higher, up
0.7%, to 12427.26. The blue-chip average is down 6.3% this year.
The session began with sobering news as the Labor Department reported its consumer-price index rose by a
larger-than-expected 0.4% in January, after a similar increase in December. In addition, crude-oil prices hit
records, settling 73 cents a barrel higher at $100.74 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That is a 5% gain
so far this year and 68% higher than a year ago.
Led by oil, raw-materials prices continued their broad-based rise. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index,
which ended at a record Tuesday, rose 0.1%, or 0.152 point, to 205.406, its second straight record. Gold
prices also rose to a high, closing at $934.60, up $8.00 a troy ounce, or 0.9%.
"For a while, people were so consumed by the credit crunch that it was easy to dismiss oil as a minor
speculative bubble. Now people are paying more attention," said J.P. Morgan Chase economist James
Glassman.
Higher commodities prices have helped the stocks of many raw-materials companies in recent months. That
was the case again yesterday, when the Dow Jones basic material index rose 1.34%. That index is up 16.5%
from a low hit on January 22.
The Standard & Poor's 500 gained 0.8%, or 11.25 points, to 1360.03, down 7.4% in 2008. The
technology-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.9%, or 20.90 points, to 2327.10. The Nasdaq is down
12% year-to-date.
The inflation news prompted futures traders to scale back expectations for additional Fed rate reductions.
Before the consumer-price data, a half-point cut in the key federal funds rate at the Fed's next policy-making
meeting on March 18 had been viewed as a certainty. And traders had priced in an 80% chance for another
quarter-point cut in April. By day's end, futures contracts suggested a 92% chance for the half-point cut in
March and 60% odds for another easing in April.
The rally took hold after the Fed released the minutes of its late-January meeting, which described Fed
officials as concerned with "downside risks" to the economy even after their recent aggressive interest cuts.
That bolstered Wall Street's confidence that the central bank will cut its key interest-rate target next month to
boost U.S. economic growth, despite the more cautious stance in the market for futures tied to interest-rate
predictions. Interest-rate cuts tend to help corporate profits and boost stocks.
"The Fed has told us that it's all about growth and they are going to do whatever it takes to make sure growth
is underpinned . . . even if we come out of this with an inflation problem," said T.J. Marta, fixed income
strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
Tech stocks, meanwhile, were helped by a strong earnings report from Dow component Hewlett Packard,
which late Tuesday reported a 38% gain in fiscal first-quarter profit and forecast better earnings for the
current quarter than analysts were predicting. Hewlett Packard shares ended 7.9% higher.
Small-company stocks, typically seen as the most sensitive to the outlook for the U.S. economy, were
especially strong. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks gained 7.68 points, or 1.1%, to 710.02. It's now
up 5.7% from its lowest close this year on Jan. 22.

One factor that may be working in favor of stocks is that investors' flight to safety in Treasury securities
appears to be abating. "People are saying, 'Let's face it, yields are really low'" and putting their money to work
elsewhere, said Jim Caron, interest-rate strategist at Morgan Stanley. Prices for Treasurys fell as investors
went into stocks, sending yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.913%, its highest
since Dec. 31 and up from a four-and-a-half year low of 3.425% on Jan. 23.

Rally Killer: Crude at $100 Weighs on Dow --- Blue Chips, Oil Swap Triple-Digit Figures; Consumer Stocks Suffer

Rally Killer: Crude at $100 Weighs on Dow --- Blue Chips, Oil Swap Triple-Digit Figures; Consumer
Stocks Suffer

Crude oil surged to a record of more than $100 a barrel, quashing a daylong stock rally as investors sold
consumer stocks that may suffer as Americans spend more at the pump.
Other raw materials also rallied, and mixed profit news from two retail bellwethers further muddied the outlook
for consumer spending, which represents more than two-thirds of U.S. economic output.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 160 points early in the session and maintained a 100-point
gain well into the afternoon. It ended down 10.99 points, or 0.1%, at 12337.22 and is off 7% this year.
Dow component Wal-Mart pointed to cautious consumer spending and said it expects earnings this quarter to
come in at less than expectations. Still, the retailer's stock rose 0.4% after the company posted a 4% climb in
fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.
OfficeMax surged 5.1% after the office-supplies retailer reported a 23% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter net
income. But sales fell, and the company said it expects economic weakness to hurt future results.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.1%, or 1.21 points, to 1348.78, hurt by a 0.6% pullback in its
consumer-discretionary sector. The S&P is off 8.1% so far this year.
Investors in financial companies were sorting out the effects of Wall Street's credit bets. Credit Suisse
reduced the value of certain asset-backed securities by $2.85 billion, blaming some of the hit on
"mismarkings and pricing errors" by traders. The firm's American depositary shares fell 5.2%.
Marc Pado, U.S. strategist for brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, said he doesn't expect the broader stock market
to be able to sustain a rally until perhaps April, when first-quarter reports from financial firms likely will provide
more details about the value of complicated credit bets on their books.
Chevron and Bank of America made their debuts as Dow components. Higher oil prices helped Chevron gain
1.5%; Bank of America slipped 0.07%.
Hewlett-Packard rose 5% in after-hours trading; it reported a 38% gain in fiscal first-quarter earnings after the
close.
Concerns about supply fueled the big rise in energy prices. Traders bid up refined fuels after an explosion
Monday at Alon USA's refinery in Big Spring, Texas. Comments by Iran's oil minister spurred worries that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may cut production at its March 5 meeting. And rebels
threatened oil facilities in Nigeria.
Crude-oil futures jumped $4.51, or 4.7%, to settle at $100.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil is up 4.2% on the year. The price set an intraday record of $100.10 a barrel.
Commodity prices have generally strengthened in recent weeks in part because of confidence that demand
can remain solid in the U.S. But if demand shows signs of slipping, or if high costs begin to translate into
higher inflation readings in the months ahead, the stock market could suffer.
"This was a pretty nasty day," said strategist Al Goldman at brokerage A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "It
looks to me like the market is going to trend lower," perhaps until the fall, when the effects of Federal Reserve
rate cuts and Washington's fiscal stimulus plan may finally produce greater U.S. growth.

Treasury prices fell sharply, pushing yields higher. Government debt often sells off when investors are
worried about inflation, which eats into bondholders' returns over time. The prospect of higher inflation also
may discourage future interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index climbed 2.8%, or 5.683 points, to a record 205.254. Metals rose
strongly after more power outages in South Africa, one of the world's leading miners. Gold futures jumped
$23.80, or 2.6%, to $926.60 per ounce in New York, ending 50 cents shy of a record.
The dollar fell against the euro and the yen, and it strengthened against the British pound after the
nationalization of the faltering bank Northern Rock. The pound traded at $1.9481 compared with $1.9525 late
Monday.

Stocks in Shanghai rose, shrugging off news that Chinese inflation had risen to its highest level in more than
11 years.
Other Asian markets also gained. In Hong Kong, Bank of China surged on word it has set aside enough
money to cover its exposure to subprime-linked investments. Japanese exporters rose, in part on a weaker
yen.
European stock markets ended slightly higher, as gains for insurers and U.K. banks helped investors to look
past an unexpected $2.85 billion write-down by Credit Suisse.
Resource stocks in both regions gained on higher gold and base-metal prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining rose
6.1% in Tokyo, while Antofagasta gained 5.2% in London.
The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks yuan-denominated Class A shares and foreign-currency Class
B shares, rose 2.1% to 4664.29. The index is still down more than 11% this year.
Analysts were divided on the likely extent of the central bank's policy response to data showing consumer
prices rose 7.1% in January from a year earlier. "I think the market does expect a little bit more tightening,"
said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Brokerages in Hong Kong. "But they also realize that the
government can't control everything, because there are shortages of material that will keep inflation high for
the time being."
"If inflation in China looks like [it is] escalating, the government will take more macro measures, like
interest-rate hikes and bank-reserve requirements being increased," he said. "[But] they don't want to tighten
up too much and kill business."
Stephen Green, Standard Chartered Bank's China head of research, wrote that China faces "a serious
short-term inflationary threat," saying he expected four more rate increases as well as more increases in the
reserves banks are required to hold at the central bank.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index rose 1.5% to close at 24123.17. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index rallied 2.3% to 13942.24, encouraged by gains in Shanghai.
Bank of China surged 7.8% on news of its subprime provisions and search for a stake in a life insurer this
year.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 0.9% to 13757.91. Among exporters, Sony
gained 2.2%, Honda Motor added 3.6%, and Canon rose 4.2%.
Credit Suisse was one of Europe's worst performers, with its shares down 6.6% in ZURICH, where the Swiss
Market Index shed 0.3% to 7462.73. The company cut the valuation of certain asset-backed positions in its
structured-credit trading business by $2.85 billion after an internal review. Credit Suisse said it suspended
some traders after "errors" on pricing.
Credit Agricole shares fell 0.3% in PARIS, after analysts expressed concern that the French bank also has
further write-downs to reveal. The French CAC 40 index rose 0.5% to 4885.83
Barclays jumped 3.7% in LONDON as the bank's 3.4% drop in 2007 net profit largely matched market
expectations. A relatively small increase in write-downs and tight cost controls helped to balance a weaker
result from international banking. Overall, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index firmed 0.3% to 5966.90.

Cadbury Schweppes slid 5.4% after the British confectioner and beverage group said it won't return any
proceeds to shareholders from the separation of its Americas drinks business that makes Dr Pepper after the
unit is split off. It also posted a 65% drop in full-year net profit.
Norsk Hydro fell 4.7% in OSLO as the Norwegian metals producer reported lower-than-expected operating
results for the fourth quarter, citing lower aluminum prices, weaker markets for downstream operations, and
adverse currency moves.
Danish brewer Carlsberg gained 2.1% as it posted a 22% rise in 2007 net on strength in emerging markets
and predicted a healthy rise in this year's sales.

Politics & Economics: Party Mate's Run Shows Waning Mugabe Support --- Electoral Challenge To Zimbabwe Leader Emboldens Rivals
Politics & Economics: Party Mate's Run Shows Waning Mugabe Support --- Electoral Challenge To
Zimbabwe Leader Emboldens Rivals

A surprise electoral challenge by a respected member of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's party has
rattled the political opposition and galvanized many who have long sought to unseat Mr. Mugabe, who has
ruled for 28 years.
On Friday, Simba Makoni registered as an opposition candidate in the March 29 presidential polls. Given a
short campaign period and the country's history of vote-rigging and intimidation, few expect victory for Mr.
Makoni or for longtime opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who also registered Friday to contest the
election. But Mr. Makoni's break from Mr. Mugabe's tightly controlled ranks indicates that the president's grip
on power may be weakening.
Since announcing he would run late last month, Mr. Makoni has been unceremoniously expelled from the
ruling party and insulted and threatened by the president's supporters. He has also attracted some support
from at least one corner of Zimbabwe's established but fragmented opposition party, the Movement for
Democratic Change, which is headed by Mr. Tsvangirai.
Mr. Makoni said he has the support of several members of the ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National
Unity-Patriotic Front, or Zanu-PF. He hasn't released a list, but some prominent party members who would be
expected to publicly defend Mr. Mugabe haven't done so. That may be a sign that other party stalwarts are
wavering, says Sydney Masamvu, a Zimbabwean and senior analyst based in South Africa for the
International Crisis Group.
"You're seeing a creation of a cross-party fight against Mugabe," Mr. Masamvu says. "Mugabe is being forced
from within [Zanu-PF] and outside, and Makoni is a representation of that fight."
Mr. Mugabe has ruled from within a tight circle of supporters who remain loyal because of his patronage. But
the loss of their support, which would include elements of the army and intelligence sector, would make it
more difficult to crush the opposition or manipulate the vote, strategies that international observers say he
has employed in the past.
Zimbabwe's polls next month will be the continent's next big electoral test, coming in the wake of badly
marred elections in Kenya, which led to weeks of violence and a political stalemate that hasn't been resolved.
Nigeria's judiciary is reviewing the country's presidential vote last spring, which was riddled with violence and
irregularities and condemned by international observers as deeply flawed.
And late last year, South Africa muddled through a tense ruling-party battle that saw the country's president
lose out to a onetime ally as party leader.
Mr. Makoni spent the years of Zimbabwe's revolutionary struggle studying chemistry in the U.K., and returned
to serve in the new government in 1980. Mr. Mugabe had come to power after defeating white supremacist
rule in what was then known as Rhodesia.
Bright and well-spoken, Mr. Makoni rose to become an influential member of the Zanu-PF politburo. Younger
than most party stalwarts -- Mr. Makoni is now 57 -- he has generally been considered a moderate. He served
for a time as the executive secretary for the Southern African Development Community, a group that
coordinates economic development in the region.
In the past, Mr. Makoni has broken from the party line in criticizing government policies, including Mr.
Mugabe's contentious policy of seizing commercial farms, a move that devastated Zimbabwe's agricultural
sector. When he was appointed finance minister in 2000, Mr. Makoni recommended the government devalue
the currency to curb rising inflation. He was promptly fired.

--- Page 173 ---
Page 173 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
After Mr. Makoni announced he would contest the election, the government expelled him from the ruling
party. He will run as an independent.
In recent years, Mr. Mugabe has faced only one major opponent: the Movement for Democratic Change.
Formed by Mr. Tsvangirai, a former mine worker, trade unionist and human-rights activist, the MDC enjoys
more support in the liberal cities than in rural areas, where Mr. Mugabe is still popular. But the party has
never won an election.
International observers have blasted previous polls, citing widespread intimidation, voter fraud and bribery. In
the past, people received state-subsidized maize only if they presented a Zanu-PF registration card. Mr.
Mugabe's electoral commission has maintained that he has been fairly elected.
But the opposition's biggest challenge this year may not even be Mr. Mugabe. By failing so far to rally around
a single candidate, analysts say politicians risk splitting the opposition vote.
Already, Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC apparatus has turned its guns on Mr. Makoni. The media wing of the party has
emailed editorials slamming Mr. Makoni as a political opportunist. At the same time, the leader of a faction
within the party has moved to support Mr. Makoni.
Zimbabwe has vast platinum and gold reserves, a skilled work force, and fertile soil. Yet under Mr. Mugabe,
the economy has crumbled. Inflation has soared above 66,000%, according to the Zimbabwe government.
About 80% of the population is unemployed, and at least three million Zimbabweans, many of them
well-educated, middle-class citizens, have fled to South Africa and other neighboring countries, where they
work menial jobs.
Mr. Mugabe has blamed his country's economic crisis on Western saboteurs hoping to return the country to
white rule. Despite Mr. Mugabe's ruinous policies, many Zimbabweans and other Africans have been
reluctant to criticize the president because of their respect for him as a revolutionary hero.

Exxon Has Off Year Discovering New Oil
Exxon Has Off Year Discovering New Oil

Exxon Mobil Corp.'s success in finding new oil and natural gas is slipping.
The world's biggest publicly traded oil company by market capitalization said Friday that it replaced just 76%
of the oil and gas it produced last year, using a reserves-accounting method favored by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Using a different accounting method that Exxon says is more representative of its
business, the company said it replaced 101% of its production last year.
Either way, Exxon was less successful in 2007 than in prior years in finding new fossil fuel. Exxon said its
101% reserve-replacement number in 2007 was the company's lowest in 14 years.
Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said the company isn't worried that its 101% reserve-replacement
number in 2007 was the lowest since 1993. Last year was Exxon's "14th consecutive year of more than
replacing what we produced," he noted. "We're proud of that fact."
The lackluster reserve-replacement numbers are a symptom of the difficult operating environment Western oil
companies face. Much of the remaining oil, Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Mark Albers said this week, is
"found in complex geologic formations, in remote locations and under harsh conditions."
What's more, rising resource nationalism is making Exxon's job more difficult. A big part of the reason Exxon
had such a low reserve-replacement number was Venezuela's appropriation of Exxon assets there. Excluding
the Venezuelan appropriations, and also excluding the smaller effect of property sales, Exxon said its
reserve-replacement ratio in 2007 was 132%.
The announcement also stokes fears about whether there will be enough oil in coming years. Demand is
rising quickly, and the big Western oil companies are not raising production reliably or replacing production
with new reserves. This fear is one reason for the run-up in oil prices in the past few years. New York oil
futures Friday finished at $95.50 a barrel, up four cents for the day and 7.4% below an inflation-adjusted
high of $103.10 a barrel reached in April 1980.
Don't count Exxon out too quickly, says Michelle Michot Foss, head of the Center for Energy Economics at
the University of Texas. The Irving, Texas, company is still meeting its obligations to deliver fuel and return
heady profits. "Even though their reserves figures may be low, there are no signs that they aren't delivering to
their customers," she says.
Reserves accounting by oil companies traditionally has been a matter of interpretation. Oil companies have
calculated their "proved" reserves -- oil and gas that can be produced using standard technology and market
prices -- based on their own internal price assessments. But in the wake of a 2004 reserves-accounting
scandal at Royal Dutch Shell PLC, many oil companies began reporting their reserves according to a method
preferred by the SEC. Under that method, designed to give investors an apples-to-apples comparison among
oil companies, companies calculate their reserves based on commodity prices on a single day: Dec. 31.
Exxon now reports its annual reserve-replacement numbers both according to the SEC's guidance and
according to the company's prior practice. In releasing its numbers Friday, Exxon reiterated that calculating
reserves based on a single day's price is "not relevant to investment decisions."

Dow Comes Out on Top Despite a Tough End to Week
Friday's Markets
Dow Comes Out on Top Despite a Tough End to Week

After beginning the week with a bounce, stocks ended it with a thud, dragged down by renewed worries about
the economy and credit markets.
Stocks fought to rebound from Thursday's 175-point decline but failed, spending most of Friday in the red
after a raft of troubling economic news. The University of Michigan said its measure of consumer sentiment
plunged to the lowest level in 16 years. The New York Federal Reserve's index of regional manufacturing
activity sank into negative territory, its biggest one-month drop on record.
Together with a tepid industrial-production reading from the Fed and a Labor Department report of surging
import prices, the data sparked fresh fears that the economy's problems might be deep-rooted.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 28.77 points, or 0.2%, to 12348.21, extending the selloff that began on
Thursday. The blue-chip average is down 6.9% this year.
Still, the Dow gained 1.4% for the week after three straight days of gains through Wednesday on hopeful
news about bond insurers and a better-than-expected retail-sales report.
The headlines turned negative at the end of the week and investors, dogged by uncertainty about the
long-term outlook, followed suit.
"The market's extremely manic now, very data-dependent," said Todd Clark, director of trading at
Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. "You get data points like [Friday's], and it doesn't make you
want to take your wallet out of your hip pocket."
The approach of a three-day weekend, hedge-fund redemptions and stock-option expirations contributed to
the volatility.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.1%, or 1.13 points, to 1349.99 after spending most of the day
in negative territory. The index ended the week 1.4% higher, but is still down 8.1% for the year.
The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.5%, or 10.74 points, to 2321.80, but ended the week with a 0.7% gain.
The technology-focused index is down 12.5% for the year.
Nagging worries about the credit markets and financial sector continue to weigh on the market. Closely held
bond insurer Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. told regulators it wanted to split into two companies. Shares of
rivals MBIA and Ambac both fell about 3% Friday.
Citigroup was one of the biggest decliners among the Dow industrials, falling 1%.
Financial stocks have risen and fallen with the bond insurers' fortunes lately, fearful their woes will trigger
billions more in credit-related bank write-downs. A UBS analyst warned Friday that the global financial sector
might suffer an additional $200 billion in losses, on top of the roughly $150 billion in write-downs it has
already taken. Still, the Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. Banks Index managed a small gain on the day.
Best Buy stoked fears about consumer spending, warning that its earnings will fall short of expectations
because of weaker-than-expected January sales. Its shares fell 2.5%, and rival Circuit City Stores dropped
nearly 5%. Shares of giant retailer Wal-Mart Stores dipped 1%
Economic concerns pushed Treasury prices mostly higher Friday, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year
note sank to 3.78%. But yields were still higher for the week after a selloff sparked by mortgage-bond
investors trying to balance their portfolios on Thursday.

Security and the Falling Dollar

Every year, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is briefed by the chief of U.S. intelligence on
potential threats to the nation. The list is sobering, but usually predictable and typically includes global
terrorism, nuclear proliferation and regional conflicts.
But this year, there was a surprising potential foe: the falling dollar. In his report to Congress last week,
Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell went beyond the conventional world of spycraft. Mr.
McConnell specifically acknowledged "concerns about the financial capabilities of Russia, China, and OPEC
countries and the potential use of their market access to exert financial leverage to achieve political ends." He
noted, in particular, the impact a weak dollar can have on national security: "As the dollar has weakened this
year, some oil producers -- such as Syria, Iran, and Libya -- have asked to be paid in currencies other than
the dollar while others -- such as Kuwait -- are delinking their currency pegs to the dollar."
It's not every day a former Navy vice admiral steeped in the culture of the defense intelligence community
talks like a central banker, but Mr. McConnell clearly recognizes a threat: "Continued concerns about dollar
depreciation could tempt other major producers to follow suit."
The rest of Washington -- and every presidential contender -- needs to start paying attention to the declining
dollar before it develops into a full-blown currency crisis with damaging geopolitical consequences. What
happens if major oil-producing nations decide to abandon the dollar for measuring the value of their most
important export? What if they set up their own monetary union to serve as an alternative to a currency that is
no longer a reliable store of value?
At a time when the Pentagon is focusing on the importance of rebuilding war-torn nations -- restoring civil and
economic stability -- as a prerequisite for lasting peace, we should be emphasizing the confidence-building
aspects of sound money. The dollar's primary role in the world financial system is the most vital nonmilitary
instrument of our national power. We cannot afford to neglect the dollar and thereby give up the global
influence that comes from providing the world's key reserve currency.
It's a matter of global energy security, first and foremost. Russia makes no secret of its ambitions to elevate
the ruble to world reserve currency status. President Vladimir Putin, in a major televised speech last Friday
outlining his strategic goals for the next 12 years, stated that Russia must become "one of the world's
financial centers" -- a logical step, he asserted, given that Russia has accumulated $484 billion in gold and
foreign currency reserves. Mr. Putin earlier called for denominating transactions for Russian oil and gas
exports in rubles. When his chosen successor, Dmitry Medvedev, is inaugurated in May, we can expect a
tightening of the link between Russian energy deliveries and currency requirements imposed on recipient
countries.
A perfect storm for dollar desertion may already be brewing. In the months ahead, China is expected to
export fewer consumer goods to the U.S. with a forcibly-appreciated yuan. Meanwhile, Chinese spending for
Russian oil and gas will likely start to ramp up. Mr. Medvedev, whose duties include serving as chairman of
Gazprom, observed this past summer that the U.S. dollar was not immune to crisis of a "comprehensive,
global character." He was thinking ahead about potential opportunities. "A situation may arise where we,
China, and some other Asian countries will speak of the emergence of a regional reserve currency." The yuan
was a possibility, Mr. Medvedev conceded. "But it is in our interest that it be the ruble."
If gold and foreign currency reserves were the only prerequisite for harboring global ambitions in the
monetary arena, China could make impressive claims of its own with $1.7 trillion as of December 2007, the
world's highest level. Japan comes in second at $973 billion. If you add together the gold and foreign
currency reserves of EU member states that have adopted the euro, including those of the European Central
Bank, the total amount in the EU is $511 billion.

Russia trails not so far behind. And beyond its considerable official reserves (which increased by 57% last
year alone) and its alarming energy clout in European and Asian markets, Russia has a growing military
presence. Not that Russia's military capabilities were ever truly contained. But those capabilities have been
constrained as Russia struggled to emerge from its Communist past and join the family of democratic nations.
Political transformation and economic renewal took precedence, so it seemed, over the large demands on
funds that clinging to military superpower status would have required.
Building up a menacing force of strategic bombers, nuclear submarines and new intercontinental ballistic
missiles is a financial luxury -- one that Mr. Putin now seems eager to indulge as Russia fills its coffers. It may
be that he sees it as the essential appendage to global power needed to carry out his strategic vision.
How else to explain the incursion of a Russian warplane on Saturday into Japanese air space, a violation that
caused 22 Japanese fighter jets to scramble and elicited a strong protest to Moscow from the Japanese
foreign ministry? The TU-95 "Bear" bomber is equipped to carry cruise missiles that can deliver a nuclear
warhead.
Japanese newspapers speculate that the intrusion might have been prompted by an annual rally held two
days before in Tokyo demanding the return of four islands seized by Russia in the closing days of World War
II. Both Japan and Russia are strongly motivated to settle the long-standing dispute; Japan wants greater
access to Russian energy supplies while Russia seeks Japanese financial capital to develop its far eastern
regions.
Just last week -- only three days before the Russian warplane sortie -- Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo
Fukuda announced he had received a letter from the Russian president offering to hold talks to resolve the
dispute over the islands. Mr. Fukuda has made plans to visit Moscow in late April or early May, convinced
that working out a settlement with Mr. Putin "is essential to lift Russo-Japanese ties to higher levels." If he
waits until May 9, Mr. Fukuda can take in Mr. Medvedev's inaugural ceremonies as well as the planned
full-scale, Soviet-style military parade -- the first display of weapons on Red Square since 1990.
Not that the crude maneuvering of carrot-and-stick incentives isn't effective, but it is dangerous. Especially
when the dealmaker has shown a high propensity to rely on the stick.
A weakening U.S. currency plays directly into fears about a weakening U.S. economy and gives credence to
self-serving pronouncements about America's weakening role in the world arena. The dollar won't be
strengthened by further interest-rate cuts or more fiscal stimulation leading to inflationary consumer spending.
If the U.S. is to reclaim its position as provider of the world's most trusted currency, we must think more
boldly.
It's time to confront currency disorder. Our goal should be to put forward a new proposal for international
monetary relations on the scale of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, invoking the same sentiments that
inspired architects John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White to provide a foundation of hope for a world
all too prone to violence. A global system based on a universally-accepted monetary asset -- the U.S. has the
world's highest level of official gold reserves, followed by Germany and France -- would not only counter
Russia's offensive. It would convert a national security threat into a golden opportunity.

Your editorial "Equity and Health Care" (Feb. 4) correctly notes that President Bush's health insurance
proposal would both decrease the regressivity of the current subsidy and remove the bias favoring
employer-provided health insurance. However, you overlook an important aspect of the proposal.
Since Mr. Bush's health insurance deduction is a flat $15,000 per year regardless of the price of a medical
insurance plan, all people (not just those with "gold-plated" policies costing more than $15,000 per year) will
have an incentive to bargain for less expensive insurance. People will discover that bargaining for a policy
that costs, say, $1,000 less will result in $1,000 of savings that can be spent on other goods and services.
Unlike the existing system, the amount of the health subsidy does not increase for any spending beyond the
first dollar. Choosing a $1,000 less expensive insurance policy in the existing system leads to significantly
less than $1,000 to spend on other things. The Bush plan is a commendable step toward reducing medical
inflation by motivating consumers to bargain for less expensive medical insurance and services.

Politics & Economics: High Food Prices Stir Movement on Tariffs

BRUSSELS -- The world's scramble for affordable food is tearing at the patchwork of agricultural tariffs that
governments have long used to control trade -- and offering a glimmer of hope to those trying to kick-start a
stalled global trade deal.
Some countries are slashing import duties to attract staples like wheat, rice and cooking oil. Europe,
traditionally the world's most outspoken advocate of protected food markets, recently removed cereal-import
duties for the first time. Others -- notably China -- are raising export duties to keep domestic markets well
stocked.
So far, the situation hasn't forced a rethinking of subsidies that farmers in the developed world receive. But
some say that is an inevitable consequence of higher global food prices. "The market situation now means
there's less pressure on farmers," says Peter Mandelson, the European Union's trade commissioner.
Mr. Mandelson and other top trade officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, recently
agreed to meet in Geneva before June. It will be their first summit at the World Trade Organization's
headquarters in nearly two years.
The WTO's 151 members have been negotiating a new global treaty since 2001. The so-called Doha round of
talks aims to give developing countries full access to Western food markets in exchange for allowing
wealthier countries to sell services like banking, insurance and construction more easily across the globe.
Talks have foundered over the refusal of the EU and U.S. to cut their lavish farm subsidies.
With today's high food prices, however, "there's much less of a need for protectionism than when we started
in 2001," said Mr. Mandelson.
A global trade deal remains a long shot. The U.S. Congress is currently drafting a farm bill that doesn't
envision cuts in subsidies. And France remains a bulwark of protectionism. "We'll need to see a long period of
high prices before we reduce subsidies," Michel Barnier, the French agriculture minister, said in an interview.
In the meantime, nations are doing what they have to do in order to stay fed.
Last month, China's Ministry of Finance announced it was setting export tariffs on 57 food commodities in the
range of 5% to 25%. The decision sparked concern about China's future exports. U.S. corn futures quickly
leapt to an 11-year high.
China has traditionally been a big corn exporter. But as Chinese people consume more of their own crop,
exports dropped to 4.5 million metric tons over the first nine months of last year, from 7.1 million tons in 2005.
That number is expected to drop again this year.
India, like other developing nations, has suffered cooking-oil shortages as the budding biofuels industry uses
more palm oil. India cut its import tariff on palm oil five times last year, bringing the levy down to 45% from
88%. "It was the only way they could make cooking oil affordable," says David Laborde, an analyst at the
Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute. India last year also banned milk-powder
exports.
Food prices aren't just a problem in Asia. The United Nations' global food-inflation index found that food
prices rose 40% last year. A host of countries, including traditional food-export powerhouses Russia,
Argentina and Kazakhstan, have moved to restrict their exports by setting new export tariffs on cereals.
The WTO has no rule against export tariffs. Although the tariffs are opposed by the U.S. and EU, poorer
countries depend on them as a revenue source, taxing commodities such as gold, oil and diamonds.

Meanwhile, Western countries are dropping import barriers. A bad harvest in France and the demand for
biofuels meant Europe was short of cereal crops last year. In the first nine months of the year, it imported 2.8
million metric tons of corn from Brazil, up from 117,000 over the same time period in 2005. To increase yield,
the EU also scrapped a rule requiring farmers to set aside 10% of their land to lie fallow.
That wasn't enough. Last month, the EU took the unprecedented step of eliminating tariffs on all cereal
imports. Officially, the tariff suspension is temporary, but EU officials say they expect it to become permanent.
Prices, they believe, will remain high. "We've never been so dependent on imports," says an EU official.
The EU's open market is expected to draw a huge inflow of corn this year, to nine million tons from three
million tons last year, and sorghum, to four million tons from 400,000 tons last year.
"It's a new world, and we need free trade," says Jurjen Ronner, a buyer for De Heus Beheer, a Dutch
company that is one of the world's biggest animal-feed producers. Mr. Ronner is purchasing Thai tapioca and
U.S. sorghum to replace a decline in domestic wheat production.
Other countries, including Brazil, South Korea, Nigeria and Russia, are also cutting import tariffs. The U.S.
Agriculture Department expects South Korea to buy an additional three million tons of corn from the U.S. in
2008.
Nigeria reduced its import tariff on rice last year to 2.7% from 100%. "In some countries, the government is
acting simply to feed people adequately," says Sorin Vasloban, a broker at Paris-based cereal trader
Plantureux SAS.
The U.S., the world's biggest producer, has no import tariffs on cereals, although it does have a levy on most
ethanol imports, which it has no plans to remove.
Economists say reducing import tariffs is a better incentive for producers than erecting barriers to exports.
"Taxing exports means there's less incentive for farmers to produce more, which is what the world needs right
now," says Mr. Laborde of the food-policy institute.
Manipulating tariffs to meet market demands isn't new. In the early 1970s, the Soviet Union suffered from
shortages of soybeans, wheat and other crops. Western powers set stiff export tariffs or quotas to stop
Moscow from buying up too much production. After World War II, weakened European powers protected their
battered farm sector with import tariffs and subsidies.
If food prices fall sharply, the global shift on tariffs could reverse. The U.N. and other agencies forecast that
prices will remain high, although this year better weather is expected to boost production in Europe and
Australia.
"Trade and trade policy are adjusting to a simple fact," says Michael Mann, the EU's agricultural spokesman.
"We used to have too much food, and now we have too little."

Saying 'I Love You' With a Metal Alloy

This Valentine's Day, jewelers are latching onto a new strategy -- selling less gold.
With prices for the precious metal having jumped more than 40% since mid-August to a record $900-plus an
ounce, some jewelry stores around the country are stocking up on styles that use gold sparingly to hold down
prices. The goal is to give shoppers an alternative to the sticker shock of 14-karat or 18-karat gold.
Fortunoff is carrying more pieces that feature a mix of gold and less-expensive silver, as well as lightweight
"lacey" gold designs. Online retailer Blue Nile Inc. is promoting more silver jewelry and pieces that mix gold
with colored gemstones or pearls, as affordable alternatives. And Tiffany & Co. has been experimenting with
diamond-and-silver jewelry.
Jewelry designers started mining these techniques a couple of years ago, when gold prices started climbing.
But the trend has accelerated over the past year. Prices are expected to rise further after the Feb. 14 holiday.
Yesterday, gold closed at $900.70 an ounce.
Designer John Hardy, whose collection is carried by Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom Inc. and
other stores, recently introduced bracelets, necklaces and pendants that feature cut-out shapes -- known in
the industry as "negative space" -- to reduce the amount of gold. Designer Judith Ripka is expanding her
selection of signature styles that can be purchased in smaller sizes, which can use a third less gold and cost
half as much. And Scott Kay, whose wares are sold by Saks Fifth Avenue, Bailey Banks & Biddle and
boutique jewelers, is using more sterling silver as an alternative to gold and palladium as an alternative to
platinum, which has also soared in price. Yesterday, platinum closed at $1,819 an ounce in the April active
futures.
The six weeks leading up to Valentine's Day are crucial for jewelers. It's typically their second-busiest time of
year, after the Christmas rush, according to Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at market researcher NPD
Group. The period leading up to Valentine's Day accounts for 15% of annual sales, he says.
This year, even more is riding on Valentine's Day than usual. The 2007 Christmas season was disappointing
for many jewelry retailers. While jewelry sales overall rose almost 3% to $9.66 billion, according to Kenneth
Gassman, president of the Jewelry Industry Research Institute, some big retailers suffered. At Zale Corp.,
sales in November and December fell a total of 9% from a year earlier at stores open more than a year.
Signet Group PLC, which owns Kay Jewelers in the U.S. and H. Samuel and Ernest Jones in the United
Kingdom, saw same-store sales fall 6.8% over the Christmas period. Even upscale Tiffany felt the pinch, with
U.S. same-store sales for the holiday period falling 2%.
Finlay Enterprises Inc., which operates jewelry departments in stores such as Lord & Taylor and Macy's and
recently bought the Bailey Banks & Biddle chain, cited higher gold prices as a factor for a decline in gross
margins in its third quarter ended Nov. 3.
Some consumers are warming up to the idea of jewelry made with less gold. Bill Ditenhafer, a 38-year-old
editor of a lifestyle magazine in Nashville, Tenn., who is eyeing some pieces as a Valentine's Day gift for his
wife, is thrilled that one of his wife's favorite designers, Judith Bright, makes only gold-filled jewelry, a
technique where a layer of gold is bonded onto a cheaper base metal.
"My wife loves her designs, but I also love the fact I can buy it without breaking the bank," he says. A
gold-filled 32-inch hand-hammered necklace, for example, costs $233, roughly a sixth what it would likely
cost in 14-karat gold.
Some designers are trying to hit all price points. A Scott Kay men's gothic cross bracelet costs $1,250 in
silver and $16,000 in palladium. That's far less than the $40,000 18-karat gold or $90,000 platinum versions.

Blake Riley, a 23-year-old sales associate with a packaging company near Indianapolis, is a case in point.
When he bought an engagement ring a few months ago at local jeweler Reis-Nichols, he first asked to see a
platinum ring, then one in white gold. He wound up choosing the same ring in palladium. The cost: $7,800,
compared with $10,000 for the platinum version. "You can't really tell the difference," Mr. Riley says, adding
that he intends to buy a palladium wedding ring for his fiancee.
But some jewelers acknowledge that by offering less-expensive alternatives, they can shoot themselves in
the foot. "We don't want to trade anyone down from platinum and diamond to white gold and diamond or
silver and diamond," Tiffany Chief Executive Michael Kowalski said in a conference call with analysts in
January.
The tweaking of assortments is occurring mostly at the lower and middle range of jewelry pieces. That's partly
because the metal in an expensive piece of jewelry from a high-end retailer typically accounts for a small
percent of the total cost, when adornments such as diamonds and labor are factored in.
Cartier's Love Cuff made in 18-karat white gold, for example, has 2,649 diamonds. "On such a bracelet, the
price of gold has no impact; it is irrelevant," says Frederic de Narp, CEO of Cartier North America. "We
absorb the cost, but [a higher gold price] does not affect us as much as it does a normal jeweler."
Gold prices have risen as investors have bought the metal as a hedge against inflation and a weak U.S.
dollar. While some jewelers lock in prices months in advance and haven't yet felt the full impact of the recent
price jumps, others have seen their margins squeezed. Prices will likely continue rising, since jewelers
typically order products at least four months in advance. Signet, in fact, said recently that it expects to
"realign" prices after Valentine's Day to reflect higher commodity prices.
"The gold jewelry available now is a bargain" compared with what it will cost later this year, says John A.
Green, chairman of the Jewelers of America retail trade group and chief executive of the Lux Bond & Green
chain in the Northeast.
Zale is "taking some selective price increases due to the increase in gold," says David Sternblitz, vice
president and treasurer. But he says the company has been able to avoid across-the-board price increases
by purchasing more stones and settings separately and assembling the pieces itself.
Blue Nile, meanwhile, is working to keep prices steady. "In an environment like we have right now, every time
we negotiate the purchase of an item, we try to lock in the price for at least six months," says company CEO
Mark Vadon.

Marinating in 'Decline'

In 1788, Massachusetts playwright Mercy Otis Warren took one look at the (unratified) U.S. Constitution and
declared that "we shall soon see this country rushing into the extremes of confusion and violence." This,
roughly, is the origin of American declinism -- and it's been downhill ever since.
A couple centuries later, an international relations theorist at Yale named Paul Kennedy sought to explain the
decline of great powers in terms of a ratio between military commitments and economic resources. The
Reagan military buildup and the deficits that went with it, he warned, had brought the United States to the
point of "imperial overstretch." Not quite. Within a few years, the Soviet Union collapsed, Europe and Japan
(with no military burdens to speak of) entered a long period of economic stagnation, and the U.S.
consolidated its position as the world's only true superpower.
Declinism is again in vogue. "America's unipolar moment has inspired diplomatic and financial
countermovements to block American bullying and construct an alternate world order," writes Parag Khanna
in a recent New York Times Magazine cover story titled, cheerfully, "Who Shrank the Superpower?" In
Sunday's Los Angeles Times, Fred Kaplan observes that "the United States can no longer take obeisance for
granted." Mr. Kaplan's new book, "Daydream Believers: How a Few Grand Ideas Wrecked American Power,"
sounds just a bit derivative of Nancy Soderberg's "The Superpower Myth" (2005), Roger Burbach's "Imperial
Overstretch" (2004) and Charles Kupchan's "The End of the American Era" (2003).
American "decline" is the foreign-policy equivalent of homelessness: The media only take note of it when a
Republican is in the White House. Broadly speaking, declinists divide between those who merely accept
America's supposed diminishment as a fact of life, and those who celebrate it as long overdue. As for the
causes of decline, however, they tend to agree: declining (relative) economic muscle, due in large part to the
rise of China; an overextended military bogged down needlessly in Iraq and endlessly in Afghanistan; the
declining value of America's "brand" on account of Bush administration policies on detention, pre-emption,
terrorism, global warming -- you name it.
Yet each of these assumptions collapses on a moment's inspection. In his 2006 book "Uberpower," German
writer Josef Joffe makes the following back-of-the-envelope calculation: "Assume that the Chinese economy
keeps growing indefinitely at a rate of seven percent, the average of the past decade (for which history knows
of no example). . . . At that rate, China's GDP would double every decade, reaching parity with today's United
States ($12 trillion) in thirty years. But the U.S. economy is not frozen into immobility. By then, the United
States, growing at its long-term rate of 2.5 percent, would stand at $25 trillion."
Now take military expenditures. Yesterday, the administration released its budget proposal for 2009, which
includes $515.4 billion for the regular defense budget. In inflation-adjusted dollars, this would be the largest
defense appropriation since World War II. Yet it amounts to about 4% of GDP, as compared to 14% during
the Korean War, 9.5% during the Vietnam War and 6% in the Reagan administration. Throw in the Iraq and
Afghanistan supplementals, and total projected defense spending is still only 4.5% of GDP -- an easily
afforded sum even by Prof. Kennedy's terms.
Finally there is the issue of our allegedly squandered prestige in the world. There is no doubt America's
"popularity," as measured by various global opinion surveys, has fallen in recent years. What's striking,
however, is how little of this has mattered in terms of the domestic political choices of other countries or the
consequences for the U.S.
In the immediate aftermath of the Iraq War, nearly every government that joined President Bush's "coalition of
the willing" -- Australia, Great Britain, Denmark and Japan -- was returned to power. France's Jacques Chirac
and Germany's Gerhard Schroeder, the war's two most vocal opponents, were cashiered for two candidates
who campaigned explicitly on a pro-American agenda. The same happened in South Korea, where the
unapologetically anti-American President Roh Moo-hyun has been replaced by the unapologetically

pro-American Lee Myung-bak. Italy's equally unapologetic pro-American Silvio Berlusconi seems set to return
to office after a brief holiday.
None of this is to say that perceptions about America play a decisive role in the politics of most other
countries. It is to say that anti-Americanism, like illegal immigration, is fool's gold politics. Nicolas Sarkozy
and Angela Merkel were not installed in office principally to mend relations with Washington. But to the extent
that both seek to liberalize their economies, or strengthen NATO, or take a responsible position vis-a-vis Iran,
it brings them closer to Washington's way of thinking.
Meanwhile, McDonald's -- the icon of everything anti-Americans detest about the U.S. -- is doing a booming
business overseas even as sales in the U.S. flatlined last year. Another icon, Boeing, is having no trouble
booking orders (meeting them is another matter) for its new 787 Dreamliner to such customers as Spain's
AirEuropa and Bahrain's Gulf Air. The quintessentially American film, "National Treasure," has earned nearly
half its gross revenue -- about $160 million -- in foreign ticket sales since its release in late December. So
much for America's loss of "soft power."
Happily for Mr. Kaplan, I look forward to receiving his forthcoming book. I'll put it right up there on the shelf
with another favorite: "19-0: The Historic Championship Season of New England's Unbeatable Patriots." I'm
guessing it will fetch a price on eBay.

The best move investors can make in the current roller-coaster stock market: Hold tight.
In this column, we feature model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds. This month, we revisit some advisers to see what they are telling their clients amid
the market tumult.
The uniform response: Investors who have asset-allocation strategies based on long-term goals shouldn't
make drastic changes. If anything, they might look for buying opportunities as stocks fall.
Here are some specifics:
-- LITMAN/GREGORY ASSET MANAGEMENT LLC: Since we profiled this firm's portfolio for moderate-risk
investors last April, recommended allocations haven't changed, says Chief Investment Officer Jeremy
DeGroot. The portfolio has about 60% allocated to mutual funds focused on U.S. large-company stocks, 15%
to foreign-stock funds, 17% to high-quality U.S. bond funds, 5% to the Pimco Developing Local Markets fund
and 3% to a fund investing in commodity securities and inflation-linked bonds.
Mr. DeGroot says the Orinda, Calif., firm has been fielding calls from some clients who are concerned about a
possible U.S. recession and want to know if they should be taking a more conservative approach. In
mid-January, when markets were particularly volatile, the firm's advisers sent out a letter to clients explaining
their views: The markets can be driven in the short term by fear or greed, but the clients' well-diversified
portfolios hold them in good stead over the long haul.
January was "a good test for individuals to see if they are comfortable with the risk levels of their portfolio,"
Mr. DeGroot says. If they feel uncomfortable, they should figure out if their longer-term risk appetite is less
than they thought it was. Only in that case should they get more conservative, he says.
The portfolio's bond component acts as a stabilizer over the long run, Mr. DeGroot says. "In periods like this,
when people are worried about the economy, bonds hold their value."
The advisers are now closely watching the market to see if the volatility presents any buying opportunities.
-- KOCHIS FITZ/QUINTILE: The San Francisco firm has made no changes in the past several months in the
portfolio we profiled in October. It calls for 39% in U.S. stocks and funds, 39% in foreign stocks and funds, 5%
in a global real-estate private investment, 5% in commodities and the rest in hedge funds and other
alternative funds.
Chief Executive Tim Kochis says that just a few clients have called recently with concerns. He thinks the
number is low because his firm has in-depth conversations with new clients at the outset about their appetite
for risk. "You don't panic, and you don't change your strategy if markets go down, because they do go down
from time to time," he says. Volatility "is the price you pay in order to get the kind of superior return that equity
exposure gives you."
In an email to clients on Jan. 22, the advisers reminded investors that their portfolios are based on a
long-term strategy that is still intact.
As global markets have fallen along with the U.S., some market observers have wondered if overseas
investments are too closely linked to the U.S. Mr. Kochis says it still makes sense to invest globally over the
long haul, because there is more room for growth abroad, particularly in developing economies like China and
India.

He says this may be a bad time to add bonds to a portfolio, because he thinks the inflation rate will increase,
which would likely prompt the Federal Reserve to take action that would raise interest rates; that would hurt
the price of bonds.
-- LEGEND FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Louis Stanasolovich, founder and chief executive of the Pittsburgh firm,
seeks to avoid the extreme ups and downs of the broad stock market in his "low volatility" portfolio by
allocating half its assets to mutual funds that use hedge-fund-like strategies. These include funds that bet on
mergers and acquisitions, and funds in which managers partly make money by betting that some stocks will
fall in price. Mr. Stanasolovich says he is happy so far with results of the funds he recommends.
He invests about 15% of the portfolio in commodity-related funds. He holds one foreign-stock fund, at 7.5% of
the portfolio, and puts another 7.5% into foreign real estate. The remaining 20% is in U.S. and foreign bonds
and a money-market fund.
While 80% of the portfolio doesn't change from year to year, Mr. Stanasolovich in recent months has made
some small "opportunistic" investments, based on his view that the U.S. economy is in a recession. For
instance, he added a structured note -- a type of debt security where the return is often based on the
performance of various market sectors -- betting that U.S. small stocks will decline more than U.S. large
stocks, which is typically the case in a slowing economy.
He also added a small allocation to the Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund, which has some investments
in gold and inflation-linked securities. He also bought a global bond fund, partly because it helps provide a
hedge against a declining U.S. dollar.

Yield Rise Seen for Longer Treasurys --- Bonds of 10, 30 Years May Buck a Trend, Some Strategists Say

Yield Rise Seen for Longer Treasurys --- Bonds of 10, 30 Years May Buck a Trend, Some Strategists
Say

Bucking a trend of broadly lower Treasury yields, some Treasury-bond strategists are forecasting that yields
in the 10-year and 30-year sectors will rise between this month and May in what they described as a bearish
seasonal pattern.
Several forces are at play. Japanese investors, the largest foreign holders of Treasurys, tend to sell bond
holdings as they repatriate funds ahead of the close of their fiscal year in March.
Supply factors also kick in. The government tends to have hefty borrowing needs in the first quarter to plug
the gap until tax receipts start flowing in April. Already this week, the Treasury is slated to sell $13 billion in
10-year notes and $9 billion in 30-year bonds.
Aggressive interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, coupled with the government's economic-stimulus plan,
may fuel concern over inflation. Adding to price pressures are elevated oil and gold prices and a falling
dollar.
Unlike the two-year note, which reacts more to changes in central-bank policies, the 10-year and 30-year
sectors are more sensitive to inflation concerns. A rise in the 10-year yield will further widen its gap with that
on the two-year note, further steepening the so-called benchmark yield curve. The gap reached 1.51
percentage points Friday, the widest since October 2004.
"The setup for the bear seasonal [period] is as good as we have ever seen because of the structure of rates
and the fact that everybody is crowded into Treasury securities from all other asset classes," said William
O'Donnell, head of U.S. government-bond strategy at UBS Securities LLC in Stamford, Conn.
"The yield on the 30-year bond [Friday] only traded at [0.2 percentage point] away from the lifetime low" of
4.1% set on Jan. 23, he said. "If you look for the bear seasonal to work, you expect to see it when we are in a
period of higher prices in bond markets, or lower yields."
In a recent report, Mr. O'Donnell identified the period from Feb. 9 to May 10 as the bear seasonal period.
Crunching data for the past 20 years, he found that the 10-year yield on average climbs 0.355 percentage
point during this period.
By the end of the second quarter, he expects the 10-year yield, 3.598% on Friday, to have risen to 4.5%,
while the 30-year yield will have increased to 5%, from 4.316% Friday.
Others snubbed the idea. "I really don't pay a lot of attention to that. It is like telling me the stock markets are
always up in January. Yes, except for this year," said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at
New York-based Merrill Lynch & Co. "I pay more attention to the fundamentals, and the fundamentals are
telling us that the trend is still for lower rates in Treasurys markets."
He said the U.S. economy has transitioned into the early stage of a recession, and the Fed will keep cutting
borrowing costs, eventually bringing the federal-funds rate down to 1% over the next 12 to 18 months. Bond
yields will grind lower, and by January next year, the 10-year yield may retest and even fall below 3.07%, the
lowest point in at least four decades.

Slowdown? MasterCard Is Feelin' No Pain

Forget about gold and platinum. One part of the credit-card industry is dazzling investors with Teflon.
A huge profit jump reported by MasterCard Inc. yesterday showed how much the slowdown in consumer
spending is dividing credit-card companies into haves and have-nots. While card issuers like banks face
deepening trouble from customers who can't pay their bills, MasterCard and rivals that process electronic
transactions still are raking in blockbuster profits from the global shift to plastic and away from cash and
checks.
"Consumers are pulling out their debit or credit cards with increasing frequency," MasterCard President and
Chief Executive Robert Selander said in an interview. Even though some recession-fearing consumers are
curbing spending on discretionary items like furniture and jewelry, most consumers will keep paying with
plastic "regardless of what happens" with the economy, he said.
And since an estimated 75% of the Purchase, N.Y., company's revenue comes from flat payment-processing
fees that are paid by merchants and card issuers, leery consumers don't hurt MasterCard as long as they
keep buying staples such as gas and groceries.
"For MasterCard, the incremental profit for a steak purchase versus bologna is not that material," Tien-tsin
Huang, a J.P. Morgan analyst told clients in a research note this week. MasterCard said yesterday that gross
dollar volume, a measurement representing the amount of money spent using cards with the MasterCard
logo, rose 15% to $634 billion in the latest quarter from a year earlier. The company processed 5.2 billion
transactions, up 17% from 2006's fourth quarter.
"We continue to stress MasterCard as an unusual combination of growth and safety as the secular global
payment trends trump U.S. consumer concerns by a large margin," UBS analyst Adam Frisch wrote in a
report issued after MasterCard's surprisingly strong earnings report.
MasterCard shares rose 9.5%, or $18, to $207 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After
slipping recently because of concerns about the economy, the stock has rebounded to within 6% of its
all-time high, reached in December. MasterCard went public at $39 a share in May 2006.
The results bode well for larger payment processor Visa Inc.'s pending initial public offering, expected to be
one of the largest in U.S. history. The San Francisco company hasn't set a date or price yet, but it is widely
expected to take place by the end of March. Visa now operates as a cooperative that is owned by thousands
of financial institutions.
MasterCard and Visa own their respective card brands and the networks that zap credit- and debit-card
transactions. Banks and other financial institutions set interest rates on the cards, collect late fees and bear
the brunt of cardholders who fall behind.
For card issuers, fourth-quarter results were ominous. After years of unusually pristine credit quality, many
financial institutions now are setting aside ballooning reserves for card balances that are unlikely to be repaid.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the second-largest U.S. bank in stock-market value behind Bank of America Corp.
and one of the biggest card issuers, expects defaults to rise to 4.5% of total outstanding card loans by
mid-2008. Washington Mutual Inc. said it expects losses on its credit cards to rise to 8.5% to 9.5%.
American Express Co. and Discover Financial Services Co. also operate proprietary processing networks for
their cards and those issued by other banks. Last week, AmEx reported a 26% jump in net income for its
card-processing unit during the fourth quarter. But a significant decline in December spending and more
money set aside for loan losses on the cards it issues resulted in a 9.9% overall profit decrease.
The Commerce Department yesterday confirmed the dour climate facing card issuers, reporting that
consumer spending rose just 0.2% in December after climbing a revised 1% in November.

MasterCard's fourth-quarter profit increased to $304.2 million, or $2.26 a share, in the latest quarter, from
$40.9 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a $185 million gain, or $1.37 a share,
from the previously announced sale of its stake in Redecard SA, a card processor in Brazil. Revenue jumped
28% to $1.07 billion.
The company also is generating big profits from cross-border transactions, collecting bigger fees when a card
issued in one country is used in another country than when the card is used in the same country where it was
issued. Mr. Selander predicted that "overall growth in cross-border activity will remain quite robust."
While revenue growth is expected to slow, Mr. Selander said it still is likely to increase by a double-digit
percentage this year. He reminded analysts that MasterCard posted transaction growth during the economic
downturn of 2001. Since then, the pace of card acceptance among merchants has grown, particularly among
fast-food restaurants.

Renewed concerns about electricity supply to South African mines boosted platinum prices.
Most-active April platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $50, or 3%, to settle at $1,737.40 a
troy ounce, after hitting a contract high of $1,742.60. In after-hours trading, the contract hit $1,744.40.
Another round of rolling blackouts hit South Africa yesterday as state-owned Eskom Holdings Ltd. -- the
nation's primary power company -- struggled to meet demand and won't ramp up the supply of electricity to
mines and other large industrial users by the end of this week as planned.
"We had a brief restart, and now that has proven to be very short-lived," said Bill O'Neill, a principal with
consulting firm Logic Advisors LLC. "It's an emergency situation over there that doesn't look like it's going to
be improved for some time."
The sector's vulnerability has put the spotlight on platinum, and investors are "jumping on" as fabricators also
seek to lock in price agreements before the metal goes any higher, said Carlos Sanchez, precious-metals
analyst with CPM Group.
In other commodity markets:
SILVER and GOLD: Silver futures rose 1.4%, as the metal benefited from rising equities and ideas that a
boost in the stock market will bode well for industrial demand. Comex silver on the Nymex for March delivery
rose 23.5 cents a troy ounce to $16.995. Gold futures rose slightly as traders digested news of Wednesday's
Fed interest-rate cut but later ran into technical resistance to limit the gains. February Comex gold gained
$2.10 a troy ounce, or 0.2%, to $922.70.
NATURAL GAS: Futures ended slightly higher, as a late burst of bargain hunting reversed earlier losses. The
contract also was supported by data showing U.S. storage volumes declined last week by 274 billion cubic
feet, the largest weekly draw ever recorded. Natural gas for March delivery rose 2.9 cents, or 0.4%, to $8.074
a million British thermal units on the Nymex.

Fed Moves to Curb Risk of Recession --- Investors Flock to Gold As Metal Hits New High; Fans in the Mainstream
Fed Moves to Curb Risk of Recession --- Investors Flock to Gold As Metal Hits New High; Fans in the

The new gold rush is on.
As inflation has picked up and the stock market has tumbled, investors seeking a safe haven have piled into
gold, driving the metal to all-time highs.
Since mid-August, New York gold futures have risen more than 42%. After finishing down at the
early-afternoon close yesterday, they shot above Monday's record of $927.10 in later electronic trading. The
peak occurred after the Federal Reserve cut its target lending rates, which sent the dollar -- gold's big
competitor -- lower.
Historically, the world's most enthusiastic buyers of the metal have been catastrophe-fearing "gold bugs" in
places like India, where banks aren't always trusted and currencies can be unstable.
Today, a different class entirely is powering gold's rise: mainstream investors and money managers who
once shunned it. They hope adding gold to their portfolios will help soften the blows of inflation, possible
recession, the sagging dollar and gyrating stock prices.
"What we have seen in the last few years is a fundamental shift in attitudes toward the gold markets" by
Western investors, says Paul Walker, chief executive at London precious-metals research firm GFMS.
Investors from Wall Street to Main Street are betting on what had long been a losing investment. After hitting
$847 an ounce in January 1980, gold futures fell for almost 20 years, grinding down to $253 in August 1999,
a 70% drop. Gold remained dull until 2001. Prices have more than tripled since then, but didn't exceed the
1980 record until this year.
The precious metal has been a horrible hedge against inflation. To keep pace with inflation going back to
1980, gold futures would need to be above $2,228 today. Believers see that as a sign that gold has a lot of
room to rise, and predict it will surpass the $1,000 mark this year.
Gold's renewed luster shows the extent to which unease has replaced optimism since 2000. The 1990s
marked a period of hope about the information-technology revolution, declining inflation and easier global
money flows -- all in a peaceful, U.S.-dominated world.
Today, optimism is clouded by terrorism, war, declining U.S. prestige, a technology-stock bubble followed by
a real-estate bubble and the emergence of China and India as economic juggernauts. Investors' affection for
gold perhaps reflects their shaken faith in the U.S. financial system and a strong dollar -- historically bedrock
beliefs -- as the housing debacle spreads.
One advantage of gold, says Marc Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a New York institution
that oversees $52 billion for wealthy families, is that it isn't regulated by any central banker who might be
tempted to print money and thus debase its value. "Gold doesn't have a policy, gold doesn't have a central
banker, gold doesn't have a printing press," he says, adding, "It is a form of insurance."
There's also talk about gold prices benefiting from the difficulty of finding new metal deposits, and the
likelihood that demand in developing countries will increase as their populations become wealthier.
Gold's backers are believed to include government-run investment pools called sovereign-wealth funds in
China, Russia and the Middle East, seeking to diversify away from dollars and weather the market storm.
U.S. money managers think they can track gold's latest surge with some precision. They point to Aug. 17,
when credit markets were seizing up amid defaulting low-quality mortgages. That is the day the Federal
Reserve stopped signaling a desire to hold the line on interest rates, announcing the first cuts in the base

--- Page 199 ---
Page 199 of 212 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
rates it uses to regulate whether money is cheap or expensive. It cut the discount rate, the rate at which
banks can borrow money from the Fed.
Some investors rightly concluded that the Fed would lower rates much more in later months, causing worry
that the dollar would keep falling, adding to inflation pressures. Investor reaction was swift: On Aug. 17, gold
began its latest sharp leg up.
That same day, a trio of managers at the mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed huddled. The Overland Park,
Kan., firm oversees about $63 billion, mainly for individual U.S. investors. Soon, Michael Avery, Dan Vrabac
and Ryan Caldwell, the three men who manage the $13.6 billion Asset Strategy Fund, Waddell's largest
investment pool, were buying more gold.
"Dan, Mike and I got together and said, there has been a clear change in Fed policy," Mr. Caldwell recalls. "It
was around the time of the flip-flop from the Fed that we decided we needed to get the bullion holdings up."
At the end of June, the fund held 2% gold. Disappointing profit reports from major banks and brokerage firms
then led the managers to boost gold holdings to 3%. After the Fed's August decision, they began buying
more bullion -- in the form of hundred-ounce gold bars stored at a bank in New York -- and exchange-traded
funds that track gold's price. By autumn, the fund was 10% gold. The fund today holds $1.51 billion in gold.
Its defensive approach has been attracting new money. Since early December, Mr. Caldwell says, the fund
has taken in $2.3 billion, 10% of which it poured into bullion and gold exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.
It wasn't just the Fed that made the Waddell managers move more heavily into gold. They also point to
troubled credit markets, developing-world prosperity and U.S. public and private debt that weighs on the
dollar. They have made other bets against the dollar, investing in the currencies of China, Russia and the
United Arab Emirates. They are tilted toward Asian stocks over U.S. stocks.
The managers had been as much as 20% invested in gold in 2003, but cut that back heavily around a year
ago. They noticed that, after the creation of ETFs made it easy to invest in gold, the metal became more
closely correlated with stock movements, which wasn't what they wanted. As the credit crunch deepened last
summer, the correlation faded, which boosted their interest in gold again.
The long bear market for stocks from early 2000 to October 2002 made many investors change their
approach. They began looking for what they call "noncorrelated assets" -- investments that wouldn't track
stocks and bonds but would show independent strength. They put money into things like real estate, timber,
private-equity investment pools, hedge funds, industrial commodities -- and gold.
ETFs and other instruments that track gold's value have made it easy for money managers to invest in a
commodity that was once cumbersome to own. In the past, investors had to buy bars, coins, futures or shares
in gold-mining companies. Now, they can buy gold as simply as shares of stock.
Doubters view gold's failure to keep pace with inflation as evidence of its risk. While gold is used in jewelry,
dentistry and electronics, the main reason for its recent rise is speculation and fear. Unlike companies, loans
or land, gold bars owned by investors produce nothing. They don't pay dividends. They sit in bank vaults
collecting dust. Their owners rarely visit, and must pay for storage. They can be melted down to make
jewelry, but lately, gold has become so expensive that many consumers are looking for cheaper ways to
adorn themselves.
It is highly unusual for traditional investors such as mutual funds and trust companies to invest so much in a
commodity they once viewed as a nonproductive asset. Until recent years, central banks around the world
were selling their gold holdings, at prices far below today's prices. Now some central banks are buying.
Three years ago, Bessemer Trust had no money invested in gold. It has about $300 million today, due partly
to new purchases and partly to investment gains, and plans to buy 10% more over the next few weeks. Its
managers say they believe the firm's gold stockpile is the greatest in its 100-year history, in either dollar or
percentage terms. That period includes the Great Depression, two world wars and the 1970s oil crisis.
Mr. Stern, Bessemer's chief investment officer, says his firm's burgeoning gold purse dates from a decision
three years ago to create a portfolio dedicated to hard assets that will do well even if inflation surges. He
recognizes that gold won't necessarily be a good investment forever, and can foresee a day when Bessemer
would cut back. But not now.
Bessemer's hard-asset fund includes energy investments, industrial materials, agricultural grains, commercial
real estate, inflation-protected Treasury bonds and precious metals. Precious metals, mainly gold, have
been growing as a percentage of that fund.

--- Page 200 ---

Bessemer isn't projecting a deep recession. Mr. Stern isn't too worried about inflation right now either,
figuring that global competition will keep overall inflation in check. But he believes lower interest rates mean
a lower return from bonds and a weaker dollar, which should help gold. And, he says, "You just need to look
at the cost of production, the [small] number of new mines coming on, the difficulties meeting demand, and
the varied sources of demand."
Other gold investors are unhappy with central-bank policy.
"I am not a fan of what central banks have been doing," says Brett Gallagher, who helps oversee about $63
billion in international investments as deputy chief investment officer at Julius Baer Investment Management,
a New York subsidiary of Zurich's Julius Baer Holdings. "Central banks have created rolling bubbles from
technology to housing" by providing too much money to the financial system over the years, Mr. Gallagher
says.
Because of the Fed's easy-money policies, "global investors in general are saying, 'We don't feel the dollar is
a good store of value,'" and they are diversifying into other assets, he says. His fund holds gold-related
stocks as well as other commodities-related shares that he thinks will benefit from a weak dollar. "Our interest
in tangible assets such as gold increased in the fourth quarter" of 2007, he says.
There are signs that ordinary investors are following the suits. OppenheimerFunds has a $2.2 billion fund
called the Gold and Special Minerals Fund that is 85% invested in gold-related stocks, notably mining
companies. Its manager, Shanquan Li, believes that dollar weakness, tight supplies and world-wide demand
could push gold to $1,100 or more this year, although he predicts the average 2008 price to be around $900.
That isn't too optimistic, given that gold is above $900. But his caution isn't holding back the fund's investors,
almost all of whom are ordinary individuals. In 2005, his fund had less than $40 million in net inflows. In 2006,
net inflows were above $250 million and in 2007, more than $600 million.
What could tarnish the gold bet? Waddell's Mr. Caldwell thinks the biggest short-term threat would be a
coordinated international push to lower interest rates world-wide. "That would help the dollar against other
major currencies," he says, and could hurt gold.

Big Oil's Not-So-Big Growth Plans --- With New Reserves Harder to Snag, Western Firms Could Opt for Smaller Role

Big Oil's Not-So-Big Growth Plans --- With New Reserves Harder to Snag, Western Firms Could Opt
for Smaller Role

Big oil companies, benefiting from oil's recent rise toward $100 a barrel, are expected to report more flush
earnings in coming weeks.
But fat results aren't likely to impress investors, many of whom are focused on more worrying long-term
trends. By several other key measures, Big Oil is shrinking.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC, the second-largest Western oil company by market capitalization, reports
fourth-quarter results today, followed in coming days by No. 1 Exxon Mobil Corp., then No. 4 Chevron Corp.,
No. 3 BP PLC and No. 5 Total SA. and No. 5 Exxon Mobil could set another record for annual corporate
profit. Investment bank Credit Suisse estimates last year's earnings from producing oil and natural gas, the
companies' most profitable segment, rose 43% from a year earlier to a combined $106.7 billion.
Individual company results will depend on how much the oil-production business offsets a profit decline in
their other operations, which have suffered from tough comparisons and declining margins. Profits for the
business of refining and selling fuels are expected to have fallen 37% to a combined $28.4 billion, according
to Credit Suisse.
Still, investors have their eyes on other figures. Beginning with Shell today, the oil companies' results will
provide a glimpse of how much their profitability is being blunted by rising costs for everything from drill bits to
engineers.
And in coming weeks, the companies will disclose their capital-spending plans for this year. Those plans will
show whether the companies will make a play to add to their supplies of oil and gas in the ground and keep
their traditional industry heft, or whether they will wait on the sidelines and continue to shovel cash to their
shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.
At least one midsized U.S. company is ready to step up its spending to produce more oil and petroleum
products. Marathon Oil Corp. said yesterday it would increase its capital budget by 67% to $8 billion this year.
For the most part, oil companies have been pouring their extra cash into dividends and share purchases.
While final 2007 figures aren't yet available, the top five Western oil companies are expected to have spent
$178.9 billion snapping up their own shares over the past four years, according to energy consultant John S.
Herold Inc. That is more than the market capitalization of blue-chip U.S. stalwarts such as IBM or Coca-Cola.
Amy Myers Jaffe, associate director of the Rice University energy program, argues that the large increases in
dividends and share buybacks are beginning to look like "partial liquidation," as the companies are "accepting
a smaller role in the future energy world in return for larger cash payouts now," she says.
Western oil majors are having trouble delivering on promises to raise production growth and find enough new
sources of crude to replace what they are pumping out of the ground -- a measure referred to as the reserve
replacement rate. Credit Suisse estimates production volumes of oil and natural gas fell 2% in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier. The companies face rising nationalism in oil-rich places like Russia and
Venezuela, restrictions in the Middle East and growing competition rising from state-owned oil companies.
One company expected to report a decline in output is Shell, which was forced last year to shut in some of its
Nigerian production due to unrest. Meanwhile, its reserve replacement rate, which it announces in the spring,
will likely be hit hard by its loss of half of its stake in Russia's huge Sakhalin II oil-and-gas venture.
Between 2004 and 2006, only Exxon Mobil has managed a better-than-100% replacement rate on its own. As
a group, the companies managed a 75% rate outside of growth through acquisitions, meaning that for every
four barrels they pumped out and sent to market they found only three new barrels in the ground.

"None of these companies are interested in shrinking, but that is effectively what they are doing," says
Charles Swanson, managing partner in the Houston office of accounting firm Ernst & Young. In the past, high
oil prices translated into higher investment as the majors poured money into new exploration. Now, though,
capital spending on new projects isn't increasing as fast as some think it should.
"They simply don't have enough lucrative opportunities to invest," says Fatih Birol, chief economist of the
Paris-based International Energy Agency. "They're investing more to slow down the decline in their existing
fields than in new production."
Oil companies contend that chasing growth at the expense of profits is foolish. Exxon Mobil spokesman Gantt
Walton says the company aims for consistency. "It goes back to using your cash wisely and not going crazy
in the good times, but not cutting back during the bad times," he says. "We consider capital discipline one of
the hallmarks of the company."
"We are not in the game of simply chasing volumes at the expense of profitability," Shell's chief finance
officer, Peter Voser, told analysts in November.
Indeed, Exxon's annual capital budget has barely budged, growing at a 1% annual rate since 2003. Other
companies have seen double-digit annual growth in expenditures. Spending on exploration or production
capabilities rose 10% to $270 billion in 2007, but most of that reflected inflation in the cost of rigs, labor and
oil-field services, according to an estimate by HSBC. Spending in real terms was flat.
Some analysts expect the majors to spend more this year. Lehman Brothers forecasts the European majors
like BP, Shell, Total and others will lift capital expenditures by an average of 14%, or by $17 billion, globally.
BP, it predicts, will raise capital expenditure this year to $21.5 billion from $18 billion in 2007; Shell to $28.8
billion from roughly $25 billion; and Total to $20 billion from $16 billion.
Some of that increase represents greater confidence that oil prices will remain high and greater efforts to
unlock resources. But BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward last year estimated oil-patch-cost inflation is
running at a 10% rate, meaning generous portions of those increases are going merely toward higher
expenses.

Crude-oil futures rose following another U.S. interest-rate cut.
The Federal Reserve's efforts to avert a recession may keep energy demand buoyant, traders said.
Light, sweet crude for March delivery rose 69 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $92.33 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. This is the fifth consecutive rise for the front-month contract.
Crude's rally began Jan. 24, two days after the Fed orchestrated an emergency three-quarter
percentage-point reduction in its benchmark interest rate in the face of a troubling U.S. economic outlook. In
cutting its federal funds target rate by another half-percentage point to 3% yesterday, the U.S. central bank
signaled it is willing to trim more as necessary.
"The language is all positive," said Tom Bentz, a broker and analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in
New York. "It's just adding to the upside potential of the oil markets right now."
Amid concerns an economic slowdown would chill oil demand, Nymex oil futures have eased back from their
$100 highs earlier this month. The Fed's moves in the last two weeks have since raised hopes that the U.S.
may steer clear of a recession.
"The view is if lower interest rates can help boost the economy in any way, it's going to be reflected in more
energy demand," Mr. Bentz said.
Oil markets rose despite U.S. data released earlier yesterday showing crude and gasoline stockpiles grew
more than expected last week.
U.S. and global oil inventories are likely to figure into discussions among Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries delegates when they meet in Vienna tomorrow. OPEC President Chakib Khelil said the group
would make the right output decision based on a weakening global economy and second-quarter demand, as
well as healthy oil stockpiles.
"Right now, stocks are at a good level and second-quarter demand is going to be lower and the economy is
not doing so well so I think OPEC is going to make the appropriate decision," Mr. Khelil said.
The oil minister of Saudi Arabia, Ali Naimi, called current global oil market fundamental forces "sound,"
offering little indication that the OPEC will alter production tomorrow.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of Nymex fell during regular-hours trading, before the Fed rate-cut
news. But then they rallied on the rate news in the thinly traded after-hours session, setting a record in
electronic trade. Nearby February gold rose in that session to an all-time high of $936.30 an ounce, erasing
the losses sustained during the day-only session, when February gold had settled at $920.60, down $4.50.
Most-active April also fell $4.50 to $926.30.
COPPER: Futures remained weaker despite the interest-rate cut by the FOMC, but moved off of the losses
established during the day-session. Copper was down during the day session on profit-taking ahead of the
meeting. Nearby February copper on the Comex fell 7.65 cents to $3.2160 a pound. At one point in
late-afternoon thinly trade after-hours session, February copper was down 2.85 cents to $3.2640.

Now we know what happens when Wall Street and the political class criticize Ben Bernanke for being "behind
the curve." He gets in his race car and accelerates right through the curve. With yesterday's 50 basis point
interest rate cut, following last week's 75 point emergency reduction, we are certainly off to the monetary
races.
Readers of these columns know we prefer more careful driving by the Fed, and judging from yesterday so do
the markets. The long bond fell more than a percentage point, while every other economic indicator that
signals a weaker dollar and higher inflation also rose. Gold hit $942 an ounce, and the dollar fell ever closer
to 1.5 euros. But the most intriguing reaction came in equities, which typically cheer a Fed rate cut, but this
time sold off on the Fed news.
Perhaps they were reacting to the Fed's statement that accompanied the rate cut, which suggested the
central bankers stood ready to ease even further if events require. Or perhaps they noticed the jolting
inflation numbers in yesterday's fourth-quarter GDP report, which had the core price deflator (not counting
food or energy) rising by 2.7%, which is well above the 1% to 2% level that the Fed says is (or at least was)
its comfort zone.
No worries, added the Fed statement, because, "The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming
quarters." We hope it's not impolite to point out that this is precisely what the Fed was saying a year ago.
Perhaps we need to recheck the definition of "moderate."
The Fed is trying to forestall a recession, and what it fears would be the cascading impact of job losses on
top of the credit crunch on top of the housing crash. And we'll admit Mr. Bernanke is in a fix, partly of the
Fed's own making. Yesterday's report of 0.6% fourth quarter growth was disappointing, though some of the
decline was attributable to inventory drawdowns that could be made up this year. In other words, a recession
is far from a sure bet.
Mr. Bernanke's calculation seems to be that by easing now he can help the financial system ride out the
current storm, and then the Fed can pull back on the throttle later this year if growth re-accelerates -- with no
harm done. We hope he knows what he's doing, but our advice is that everyone bring a crash helmet in case
he misses a turn.

Fed Moves to Curb Risk of Recession --- Central Bank Lowers Target Rate by Half Point, Open to Further Cuts
Fed Moves to Curb Risk of Recession --- Central Bank Lowers Target Rate by Half Point, Open to
Further Cuts

Seeking to nip an incipient recession in the bud, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time
in nine days, in one of its most aggressive campaigns in decades to boost the nation's economy.
The Fed lowered its target for short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3% yesterday, and left the
door open to further cuts.
In its statement accompanying the move, the Fed said "downside risks to growth remain," and that the
central bank would "act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks." Investors widely expect the
Fed to lower its benchmark rate again in March by 0.25 percentage point to 2.75%.
Yesterday's rate cut comes as the latest news suggests the economy continues to skirt recession despite a
steep slump in housing and the continuing credit crunch, but financial markets remain fragile.
Stocks rose on news of the cut, which some investors had expected to be smaller, but the market tumbled
late in the day after a downgrade of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. by Fitch Ratings intensified worries
about the credit ratings of bond insurers, which insure about $2.4 trillion of debt. Such downgrades could
leave banks exposed to additional losses on the mortgage-backed debt they hold, further eroding their capital
and limiting their ability to lend.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up as much as 201 points after the Fed announcement, ended the day
down 37.47 points at 12442.83.
The government reported yesterday that the economy grew at a slower-than-expected 0.6% annual rate in
the fourth quarter of 2007. Most of the weakness stemmed from companies trimming inventories, which
makes future production cuts less likely. Consumer spending slowed, though to a still-respectable pace.
A private payroll survey also found employment jumped in January. That led some economists to expect the
Labor Department tomorrow to report robust job growth for the month, after a slump in December.
Last week, on the heels of a global stock selloff, the Fed made a surprise 0.75-percentage-point cut in its
target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks. That it went ahead with
yesterday's rate cut despite some encouraging economic data underlines its worries that slumping housing
prices and associated losses on mortgages could yet drag the entire economy down. The Fed's 2.25
percentage points in rate reductions since September roughly equal the initial pace of cuts in early 2001 --
following the bursting of the tech bubble -- as the most rapid in two decades.
The big question now facing the Fed is whether it has done enough. Officials yesterday signaled continuing
concerns about growth.
"Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses
and households," the Fed said in its statement. "Recent information indicates a deepening of the housing
contraction as well as some softening in labor markets," it added, echoing previous comments. But
yesterday's statement also dialed back the sense of urgency, dropping the "appreciable" from what it said last
Tuesday were "appreciable downside risks to growth."
The latest statement included a reminder of how much the Fed has done to date: "Today's policy action,
combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the
risks to economic activity."
Some analysts took that to mean the Fed doesn't expect to cut rates as low as 2.25%, as markets currently
anticipate. "While the Fed certainly left the door open for further action, the policy assessment did seem to tilt

toward reining in expectations of significant additional action," Morgan Stanley economist Dave Greenlaw
said in a note to clients.
But Tom Gallagher, an analyst at brokerage ISI Group, said, "You can't be confident the Fed is done until you
feel the market has a good handle on the extent of the financial crisis," which it clearly hasn't yet.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who celebrates his second anniversary in the job tomorrow, now faces a
delicate challenge. If his policy is successful, the economy will escape recession, few additional rate cuts will
be needed and, paradoxically, his actions to date may end up looking excessive.
"If we end up worrying about inflation later this year that could well be the good outcome for the Fed
because odds are it will mean that the economy has stabilized," said Peter Fisher, a former Fed official who is
now co-head of fixed income for money manager BlackRock Inc. "It may end up looking like the pre-emptive
easing was unnecessary . . . but that's the point of taking out insurance against the downside."
If so, that would require the Fed to quickly reverse some of its rate cuts. "They acted aggressively on the way
down; that suggests they'll act as aggressively on the way up," said Vincent Reinhart, a former top Fed staffer
now at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank.
But the Fed, like most of Wall Street, has already been fooled by several false dawns since the current credit
crisis began in August. That means it's unlikely to sound the all-clear while financial markets remain jittery
and credit markets remain tight. Yesterday's statement, while less dire than last Tuesday's, made it clear the
next Fed move is far likelier to be a rate cut than an increase.
Until this month, the Fed had expected the troubles in housing and mortgage markets wouldn't spill over to
the broader economy, and that inflation pressures would continue to percolate. That led it to release
statements that continued to play up the risks of inflation, implying that rates might not fall much more.
That changed in January with news that consumer spending, employment and manufacturing activity had all
downshifted. Concerns in the financial markets grew, as signified by the sharp drop in stocks at the start of
the year.
The possibility that falling house prices will lead to more defaults and foreclosures, loss of bank capital, tighter
lending and yet further declines in prices is now Mr. Bernanke's dominant concern. Yesterday afternoon,
rating firm Standard & Poor's downgraded or threatened to downgrade more than 8,000 mortgage
investments.
Mortgage rates have dropped in the past month, and that has enabled many borrowers with adjustable-rate
mortgages either to refinance into fixed-rate mortgages or see their current mortgages adjust to rates one to
two percentage points lower than would have been the case several months ago, says Doug Duncan, chief
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. He said while that means foreclosures may be less than
expected, the drop in home prices means many borrowers will be unable to take advantage of lower rates,
limiting the benefit.
If home prices fall 10%, a mortgage that was originally 95% of the home's value is now about 105%, and "you
may be required to bring some equity to the table in order to refinance," Mr. Duncan said.
Yesterday, many commercial banks responded to the Fed's action by lowering their prime rate, a benchmark
for many consumer and business loans, to 6% from 6.5%. But long-term bond yields rose in anticipation that
the rate cut would boost growth and the risk of inflation. That could lead to higher, rather than lower,
mortgage rates in coming weeks.
Both last week's and yesterday's Fed statements played down concerns about inflation. The Fed "expects
inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation
developments carefully."
That view isn't universally shared at the Fed. Nine of the Federal Open Market Committee's 10 voting
members approved yesterday's rate cut; Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher dissented,
arguing for no cut. Three of the Fed's 12 reserve banks didn't ask for a corresponding half-point reduction in
the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to banks, to 3.5%.
Indeed, in the past few weeks, expectations for inflation a few years from now, as measured by the behavior
of Treasury-protected bonds, have risen by a quarter percentage point.
While Mr. Bernanke won't welcome that, he will likely conclude that the weaker economy he now expects,
together with stable to lower energy prices, will help suppress those inflation pressures.

South Africa Firm
To Boost Electricity
South Africa's state power company promised to increase electricity supplies this week to mines crippled by
outages but warned it would soon have to start rationing electricity. Power cuts have halted most mining in
the major producer of gold and the world's top platinum miner, driving precious-metals prices to historic highs
and shaking confidence in the continent's biggest economy.

U.K. Group Calls
For Quick Rate Cut
The U.K.'s leading business lobby called for a quick cut in official interest rates, a plea that coincided with
news of a sagging retail economy and growing debt-repayment problems in British households. "We would be
very pleased to see [a quarter of a percentage point] interest-rate cut in February," said Ian McCafferty, the
Confederation of British Industry's chief economic adviser.
India's Central Bank
Holds Rates Steady
India's central bank kept its key interest rates unchanged, with an eye to controlling inflation in one of the
world's fastest-growing major economies. The Reserve Bank of India in its quarterly monetary policy review
kept its closely watched repo rate -- the rate at which banks borrow money -- at 7.75%. Some have predicted
a cut to make up for the impact of a slowing U.S. economy.
