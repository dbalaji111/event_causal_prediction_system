Corrections & Amplifications
A program of outward investment from China is named QDII, for qualified domestic institutional investor. An
article Wednesday incorrectly said the program's name stands for qualified domestic international investor.
(WSJ February 1, 2008)
(END)
Shanghai -- As China's stock market slumps from its recent dizzying heights, investors in the world's most
populous nation increasingly have the option to move money into shares traded overseas, including the U.S.
Even so, don't expect them to inflate the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a China-style bubble soon.
In the latest move to give Chinese investors access to the U.S. market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is expected to sign a memorandum of understanding in the next several days with the China
Banking Regulatory Commission that will allow banks in China to develop U.S.-stock mutual funds for their
clients, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The move is noteworthy because while mutual-fund companies in China can already offer their clients access
to the U.S. markets, banks cannot yet develop their own funds.
The banking agreement is part of a trend in the past 18 months: The door has swung open for ordinary
Chinese people to invest more of their $2.4 trillion in savings overseas. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
has been urging China to ease its capital controls and permit the outward flows. Plans for Chinese money to
hit U.S. markets were hatched during meetings this past May and December of the Strategic Economic
Dialogue, a bilateral forum that Mr. Paulson helped to launch.
Ethiopis Tafara, director of SEC's office of International Affairs, confirmed the agreement, saying "CBRC and
SEC staff have agreed in principle to exchange letters in the near future on information-sharing in connection
with the cross-border activity of financial institutions licensed by either the CBRC or the SEC."
A Chinese bank-regulatory spokesman in Beijing referred to past statements the agency has made that it
already has similar agreements with counterparts in Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom, and will
set them soon with the U.S., Germany and Japan.
Already, brokerages, banks and fund companies in China are pitching to the country's investors a
fast-expanding array of mutual funds and other products that invest in, or reflect values of, world-wide stock
and bond markets. Dubbed QDII, for qualified domestic international investor, the program marks the first
legal channel for China's investors to put money in foreign financial markets.
Until about mid-2006, tough capital controls made it almost impossible for individuals in China to convert yuan
into U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies, much less invest in overseas stock and bond markets. Now,
individuals can convert yuan worth as much as $50,000 a year, reflecting how Beijing is eager to offset
continued inflows into China by sanctioning more outflows.
HSBC Holdings PLC estimates QDII products worth more than $50 billion have already been approved -- not
far off the roughly $66 billion earmarked for overseas allocation by Beijing's much-watched sovereign fund
China Investment Corp., which last year bought into Blackstone Group Ltd. and Morgan Stanley., which last
year bought into Blackstone Group Ltd. and

"You are talking about real international access for retail investors in China," says Peter Alexander, principal
of Z-Ben Advisors Ltd., a Shanghai consultancy on China's fund-management industry.
The pending U.S.-China agreement for banks moderately expands the existing channels for foreign
investment. Under it, banks in China will be permitted to design their own U.S. stock funds -- instead of selling
products on behalf of other firms like mutual-fund companies. Banks are important because their branches
are the primary platform for distributing financial products in China.
One hitch is frustrating the QDII industry: Individual Chinese don't yet show much enthusiasm for global
investing -- in the U.S. or anywhere else. Almost all of the products introduced so far have been
undersubscribed, and many have declined in value.
Quite simply, investors in China don't think the rest of the world looks very attractive right now. The caution
reflects the kind of worries about a U.S. recession that have caused global market turmoil. Plus, confidence
hasn't completely evaporated from the local stock market -- even with the Shanghai Composite Index into
bear-market territory with a 27% loss since October's peak.
But a particular obstacle to faster development of the QDII program is China's currency, and specifically the
expectations that the yuan will strengthen more in 2008 than the 7% it gained against the U.S. dollar last
year. Chinese investors are deciding they would be better off with their money in simple bank accounts at
home than holding a stock or bond denominated in U.S. dollars.
Chinese regulators recently announced QDII funds also will be able to hold part of their investment in
domestic markets, which is meant to offset some of the currency risk.
Most of the QDII equity investment has so far been targeted at Hong Kong, which has been unappealing to
Chinese investors, as the city's market has been hit hard in the past six months by the U.S.
subprime-mortgage concerns.
The U.S. also is starting to see QDII cash, along with markets such as Mexico, Sweden and the U.K. A $3.7
billion pan-Asia fund co-managed by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. in Shanghai, for instance, reported that about
$357 million, or 9.7%, of its stock investment on Dec. 31 was in the U.S. That was largely U.S.-traded
American depositary receipts, including those of Icici Bank Ltd. and Reliance Industries Ltd., both of India,
plus Posco of South Korea.
Despite his long-term optimism for the trend, Mr. Alexander of Z-Ben Advisors says it is natural to expect
China's investors to move cautiously into overseas investing. "You could say the same thing about the U.S.,"
says Mr. Alexander. "It's called home bias."
Global Markets Climb
Ahead of Fed News
Stock markets around the globe mostly rose, as investors reassessed the scope of the year's declines and,
more important, on expectations of a further cut in U.S. interest rates at today's meeting.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 1.8% to 324.31. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index is off
11% for the year, but it has managed to claw back around 5% since Thursday.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index advanced 1.7% to 5885.20. Shares of mining firms advanced, as gold
futures stayed near recent records. Anglo American gained 5.8%.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 3% to 13478.86. Financials led the gains.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group rose 4.6%, and Mizuho Financial Group advanced 4.8%.
In MEXICO CITY, the IPC index surged 1.8% to 28263.95. Cemex, one of the world's largest cement makers,
was a top gainer, after it reported a 43% rise in fourth-quarter net profit and maintained its forecast for 2008.
Its shares jumped 4.7%.

Asia, Europe Shares Slide on U.S. Worries

Asia, Europe Shares Slide on U.S. Worries
A WSJ News Roundup

Continued worry that the beleaguered U.S. economy will slow global growth hurt shares in both Asia and
Europe yesterday.
Shanghai took the biggest hit. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 7.2%, as winter storms threatened to
exacerbate national energy shortages and accelerate already-high inflation. The loss halted a three-day
winning streak and left the index down 16% this month.
In Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul, the decline in share prices ranged from 3.8% to 4.3%.
In Europe, the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index declined 1.1% to 318.70, bringing its loss for the
month to nearly 13%. That leaves the index on track to record its second-steepest monthly decline ever, after
a 14% plunge in September 2002.
"Earnings-revisions trends remain crucial to the outlook for equities," said Gareth Williams, an equity
strategist at ING. "Fourth-quarter results from 2007, first-quarter outlooks for 2008 and the prospect of
recession means consensus earnings are now adjusting."
But at least one strategist said European stocks have priced in a significant amount of bad news. "We still
believe that unless we get a serious U.S. recession, European markets will be up, not down, for 2008," said
Karen Olney at Merrill Lynch.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies fell 4% to 13087.91. Nippon Steel sagged 7.7% after
the steel giant said net profit in the October-December quarter skidded 13% as weakness in U.S. demand
and higher-than-forecast price increases for raw materials exacerbated the effect of a slump in Japan's
construction sector.
Analysts said Nippon Steel's earnings were a warning that a U.S. slowdown is about to be felt in Asia. Many
of the region's biggest companies depend on sales in the U.S. and other developed economies to spur
growth. Some economies are doubly exposed because they sell both directly to the U.S. and to other Asian
economies that later export to the U.S.
In HONG KONG, shares slumped 4.3%, as investors hurried to exit shares ahead of any additional bad news
out of the U.S., including a possible decision by the central bank not to lower interest rates again after last
week's surprise federal-funds-rate cut. China Mobile, the index's biggest constituent by market capitalization,
fell 4.8%.
Meanwhile, two more initial public offerings have been called off in Hong Kong, essentially drying up the
pipeline amid market turmoil.
While Chinese solar-wafer maker Solargiga Energy Holdings Ltd. and civil-engineering firm SFK Construction
Holdings Ltd. aren't coming to market now, bankers said IPO activity will pick up later in the quarter as the
global economic outlook becomes clearer.
"While the markets today are challenging, the majority of equity markets are very liquid, providing some
stability," said Marshall Nicholson, head of equity capital markets at BOC International.
More offerings are expected after the New Year, with market watchers saying the real test for IPOs lies in
state infrastructure firm China Railway Construction Corp.'s US$4 billion offer in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
In MUMBAI, the bellwether Sensex fell 1.1%. Real-estate giant DLF dropped 5.6%, outsourcer Infosys
Technologies was down 4.9%, and telecommunications giant Bharti Airtel fell 4.9%.

In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index fell 1.4% to 5788.90, its third decline in four sessions. Mining stocks
tumbled on worries about global economic growth. Anglo American fell 4.8%.
In PARIS, the CAC 40 index dropped 0.6% to 4848.30. Societe Generale fell an additional 3.8% as details
continue to emerge on how one trader could have cost the bank $7.2 billion in unauthorized trades.
Other banks lost ground as worries about write-offs persisted. Erste Bank fell 6.3% in Vienna, Natixis shed
3.2% in Paris, and HSBC Holdings lost 2% in London.
But Dutch-Belgian banking group Fortis, which was hammered Friday on worries about a write-down, gained
8.3%, making up most of that loss. Munich Re climbed 1.4% after the reinsurer's chief executive told a
German newspaper that management is no longer concerned about the firm's exposure to subprime-related
investments.
In MEXICO CITY, stocks closed higher, as investors bet on further rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve
later in the week following a worse-than-expected U.S. housing report.
The IPC index of 35 most-traded issues rose 1.4%, or 379.01 points, to close at 27758.93.
"People are waiting for [U.S.] consumer data [Tuesday]. There is some optimism it could come in positive," a
Mexico City trader said.
The IPC rose 2.5% last week after the Fed cut interest rates. U.S. markets, which influence the IPC, also
closed firmly in the black on Monday as investors bid stocks higher on expectations the Fed will cut rates at
its regularly scheduled meeting following another poor housing report.
Among local issues, the L shares of telecommunications bellwether America Movil rose 3.1%; shares of
fixed-line telephone company Telefonos de Mexico closed 2.8% higher and the V shares of the country's top
retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico rose 1%.
The B shares of airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, or Asur, fell 3.5% as UBS Investment
Research Monday downgraded its recommendation to neutral from buy, citing an "overextended" valuation.
In TORONTO, stocks closed slightly higher as shell-shocked investors awaited the latest move from the U.S.
Federal Reserve. Trading activity was relatively muted in comparison with last week's volatility
The S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 92.08 points, or 0.71%, to 12986.91.
"Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until the Fed meets. That is going to be key," said Gareth Watson,
Canadian equity adviser at ScotiaMcLeod.
The materials index was the best performer Monday, rising 2.1%. Yamana Gold gained 76 Canadian cents to
C$16.46 while Goldcorp added 0.32 to 38.44. Barrick Gold rose 1.28 to 53.77 and diversified miner Teck
Cominco gained 0.13 to 32.79.

Speculators Rush to Buy Gold
Commodities Report
Speculators Rush to Buy Gold

Gold futures set highs yesterday on support from a weaker dollar, stronger crude and equities, supply
disruptions and options-related buying, market watchers said.
Platinum and silver also rose.
Nearby January gold rose $16.60 to settle at $927.10, setting a front-month high on the Comex division of
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Most-active April gold jumped $16.60 to $932.80 after reaching a
contract high of $935.40.
Speculators were buying gold as equities and oil mounted a comeback, the dollar weakened and power
disruptions affecting South African mines continued to support the market, said Andrew Montano, director of
precious metals at Scotia Mocatta.
Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path Trading, said electricity problems in South Africa
weren't as much of a factor as the dollar's weakness and oil's recovery.
Options-related buying also boosted gold as participants bought back previously sold positions and entered
into new long trades. Options are the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying future.
February gold options expiration prompted the buying as some foreign miners were trying to cover options
trades, said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
But Mr. Gero cautioned that the gold market was waiting for central bank actions, and "continued strength
may weaken after first-notice day."
First-notice day, or the first day when futures contract holders can be notified of an obligation to take delivery
of a commodity, for February gold futures is Thursday.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: After starting the trading day with losses, futures closed slightly higher, supported by a stronger
U.S. equities market and expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will leave oil
output steady at a Feb. 1 meeting. Light, sweet crude for March delivery settled 28 cents, or 0.3%, higher at
$90.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
WHEAT: Prices rose to their day exchange-imposed trading limit of 30 cents a bushel as grain market prices
are rising in an effort to lure farmers to plant either corn, wheat or soybeans this spring in the U.S. Chicago
Board of Trade March wheat futures gained 30 cents a bushel to $9.63.

WellCare, Newmont, Nymex Rise
Abreast of the Market
WellCare, Newmont, Nymex Rise

Stocks rose as the latest in a long line of dismal housing reports raised hopes of an aggressive rate cut from
the Federal Reserve, a boon for banks like Citigroup and gold miners such as Newmont Mining.
There was give-and-take in the deal market, with Nymex Holdings a major winner and Alliance Data Systems
a major loser.
New-home sales fell to the lowest mark in 12 years in December and prices also slid. Spurred by that data,
fed-funds futures, a prediction market for rate changes, reflected increased odds of a half-percentage-point
cut tomorrow. That sparked a rally among stocks that benefit from lower interest rates. Citigroup added
$1.01, or 3.8%, to $27.65, and home builder Toll Brothers rose 91 cents, or 4.2%, to 22.37.
"We may see 125 basis points [1.25 percentage points] of cuts" in the space of little over a week, said Steven
Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Co. When interest rates come down sharply, "it usually bodes
well for the stock market in general."
Generally, "leadership tends to emerge when the Fed becomes aggressive -- financial stocks tend to
outperform the broad market, followed by retailers, followed by home builders." Until the most recent rate cut,
those leadership groups continued to be "trashed," Mr. Goldman said, but they may finally be gaining traction.
Commodities futures, principally priced in dollars, rallied on the expectation of loosened monetary policy.
Newmont Mining rose 1.96, or 3.7%, to 55.22 as gold prices set record highs. Gold's move reflected rate-cut
anticipation and also the idling of South African mines because of a power shortage. American depositary
receipts of AngloGold Ashanti fell 1.26, or 2.9%, to 41.75 while Harmony Gold Mining shed 59 cents, or
5.4%, to 10.28.
Nymex Holdings, surged 9.34, or 8.7%, to 116.50 after a report the operator of the New York Mercantile
Exchange has talked with Chicago peer CME Group about a potential $11 billion buyout.
Alliance Data Systems plunged 23.12, or 35%, to 42.48 after Blackstone Group said it probably wouldn't
complete its leveraged buyout of the payment and credit-card processor because of onerous approval
conditions set by a regulator. Alliance Data disputed Blackstone's position that those conditions were a deal
breaker. Blackstone fell 21 cents, or 1.1%, to 19.15.
SLM, better known as Sallie Mae, rose 57 cents, or 2.9%, to 20.45 after the student lender refinanced a $30
billion credit line and ended its dispute with private-equity firm J.C. Flowers, which pulled out of a buyout deal.
New York Times rose 1.41, or 9.6%, to 16.07 after two hedge funds indicated they were seeking seats on the
board of the newspaper publisher, possibly the first move in a push toward a sale.
Black & Decker slipped 10 cents to 69.88 after the maker of power drills and lawnmowers warned that
deterioration in its business may continue without a housing-market recovery.
Verizon Communications rose 35 cents to 38.11 after the telecommunications company posted growth in its
wireless business.
Personnel moves affected some shares, too.
Sears Holdings (Nasdaq) rose 1.28, or 1.3%, to 100.28. Controlling shareholder Edward Lampert reshuffled
the leadership of the department-store chain, installing Bruce Johnson as an interim replacement for Chief
Executive Aylwin Lewis.

WellCare Health Plans rose 4.96, or 12%, to 48.08 after three top executives quit the manager of Medicaid
and Medicare health-care plans. Those departures came as WellCare disclosed that a federal inquiry is
focused on relationships between various plans and units involved with Florida behavioral-health operations.
Corning rose 73 cents, or 3.3%, to 23.10 after the maker of glass and optical fiber projected first-quarter profit
surpassing the Wall Street estimate, helped by demand for flat-panel televisions screens.
Among energy issues, Halliburton tacked on 46 cents, or 1.4%, to 33.55 after the oil-field services company
posted quarterly profit growth, helped by Asian demand.
General Electric rose 72 cents, or 2.1%, to 34.72 after the conglomerate agreed to buy a manufacturer of
oil-services equipment, part of steel-tube maker Tenaris, for $1.115 billion. American depositary receipts of
Tenaris rose 1.64, or 4.3%, to 39.62.

How to Survive The New Gold Rush --- Investors Race Into the Hot Commodity, Even as Advisers
Warn That Gains May Have Peaked; Beware the Tax Hit

Gold has been riding its reputation as a safe haven to new highs. But it also carries substantial risks for
investors.
With fears of a U.S. recession prompting investors to abandon stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is
down 6.6% so far this year. Gold, meanwhile, has been hitting new records. The precious metal has gained
11% this year, to $927.10 an ounce, and has soared 46% since the end of 2006. As the dollar weakens and
the economy and markets appear increasingly unstable, some market watchers believe the metal is now
headed to $1,000 an ounce.
Investors, for their part, poured a net $6.1 billion into precious-metals mutual funds and exchange-traded
funds, or ETFs, last year, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc. Many investors are getting
access to gold through exchange-traded products like streetTracks Gold Shares, which is designed to track
the price performance of gold bullion, minus fees. ETFs resemble traditional mutual funds but trade
throughout the day like stocks.
Gold can help investors diversify and reduce their overall portfolio risk, financial advisers say, since it tends
to behave differently than stocks. But at current levels, investors may be paying a high price for that
diversification. Though many investors consider gold a hedge against inflation, it hasn't always lived up to
that reputation. The metal's price can be extremely volatile, and many gold investments come with significant
tax consequences.
While the streetTracks Gold and iShares Comex Gold ETFs are popular among small investors seeking easy
exposure to gold, the Internal Revenue Service treats them like collectibles, taxing long-term gains at a
maximum rate of 28%. That compares unfavorably with the maximum 15% rate on long-term capital gains on
securities and qualified dividends.
Financial advisers also warn that since gold is considered a haven in times of crisis -- and is less in demand
for practical uses than other commodities such as copper and oil -- it tends to attract emotional, speculative
investors who can amplify its price gyrations. Gold "is too narrow, it's too volatile, and historically it hasn't
made that much money for people," says Randy Carver, president of Carver Financial Services in Mentor,
Ohio.
Some also see risks to gold investors in the current market. The dollar's long decline may be near an end,
some market watchers say, and if it rebounds, that's likely to hurt gold.
Indeed, some advisers who have recently used gold in their clients' portfolios are now backing off. Don
Martin, a financial planner in Los Altos, Calif., told clients to buy gold last summer. But "now it's burned itself
out," he says. "Gold and other precious metals are too high-priced to be a safe haven."
Investors should avoid rushing into the metal in times of crisis, advisers say. A recent study by researchers at
Trinity College in Dublin found that, while gold generally holds up well when stocks decline substantially, that
effect is short-lived. "Most of the safe-haven effect comes in the first couple of days" after a stock decline,
says Brian Lucey, associate professor of finance at Trinity College and co-author of the study. Individual
investors who try to buy in a few days after a stock slide are likely to miss many of the benefits of holding
gold, he says.
Advisers say that for most investors, a broad commodities fund with a small allocation to gold is a better bet
than a pure play on the precious metal. Fund companies have rolled out a number of such products in recent
years, including some that offer broad diversification at low cost.
Gold has continued to climb this year as the Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to further cut interest
rates. Last week, the Fed cut the federal-funds target rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, and is

widely expected to cut it further when it meets today and tomorrow. Rate cuts, which tend to weigh the dollar
down, generally help the price of gold. An increasingly cloudy financial and economic picture and geopolitical
tensions have also helped to spur gold to new highs.
Yet gold doesn't produce earnings or pay dividends, and its returns over the long haul often look less
enticing. From 1969 to 2007, gold was more volatile than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and
produced substantially lower returns, according to Gerstein Fisher, a New York financial-advisory firm. A
dollar invested in gold at the beginning of 1969 would have grown to less than $20 by the end of last year,
compared with nearly $50 for the S&P 500, according to the firm.
What's more, gold has failed to keep pace with inflation in recent decades. The average 1980 price of gold
inflated to 2007 dollars would be $1,563 an ounce, well above today's price, says Brad Zigler, managing
editor of Hardassetsinvestor.com.
Advisers say investors should opt for diversified funds that include gold-related holdings -- and hold on to
them for the long term. One option: precious-metals funds, which generally buy the stocks of mining,
processing and distribution companies. American Century Global Gold focuses on gold-related companies,
while funds like Oppenheimer Gold and Special Minerals and Franklin Gold and Precious Metals invest more
broadly in precious-metals stocks.
But since they hold stocks instead of bullion, such funds can be buffeted by the same winds as the broader
stock market, diminishing the diversification benefits of a gold investment. They also tend to invest heavily in
overseas companies, so investors considering them should keep a close eye on their overall foreign-stock
allocation, advisers say.
A 5% to 10% allocation to a broadly diversified commodities fund is a better way to include gold in a portfolio,
many advisers say. These funds often track indexes that include oil, wheat, copper and other commodities,
as well as gold. Like gold alone, such funds will generally behave much differently than stocks -- and they
can reduce risk by spreading investors' bets among many hard assets.
Investors should pay close attention to the commodity index tracked by such funds, seeking the broadest
basket possible, says Morningstar analyst Sonya Morris. Some indexes are far more diversified than others.
While offering broad diversification, commodities funds can be complicated vehicles for small investors. Many
use futures contracts to track commodity prices. Typically, 60% of the gains on these contracts are taxed at
long-term capital gains rates, while 40% are taxed at short-term rates, creating a maximum blended tax rate
of 23%. Relative to the collectible tax rate, that's "a good outcome for individuals," says Robert Gordon,
president of Twenty-First Securities Corp.
Many new products are structured as "exchange-traded notes." Since many of the notes essentially represent
the issuer's promise to give investors the return of an index, minus fees, they eliminate the risk of tracking
error. But they also saddle investors with the risk that the issuer will default.
The IRS has also asked for comment on the appropriate tax treatment of exchange-traded notes. Given the
uncertainty, it makes sense for tax-sensitive investors "to house these in tax-sheltered accounts," says
Morningstar's Ms. Morris.

Golden Years
Gold has lately been hitting record highs, but it comes with substantial
risks for small investors.
Pure-play gold investments can be extremely volatile.
Though it's seen as a hedge against rising prices, gold hasn't always kept
up with inflation -- and it can wreak havoc on your tax bill.
Broadly diversified funds that hold a wide range of commodities, including
gold, may be a better bet for investors, advisers say.

The Economy Is Fine (Really)
The Economy Is Fine (Really)

It is hard to imagine any time in history when such rampant pessimism about the economy has existed with
so little evidence of serious trouble.
True, retail sales fell 0.4% in December and fourth quarter real GDP probably grew at only a 1.5% annual
rate. It is also true that in the past six months manufacturing production has been flat, new orders for durable
goods have fallen at a 0.8% annual rate, and unemployment blipped up to 5%. Soft data for sure, but
nowhere near the end of the world.
It is most likely that this recent weakness is a payback for previous strength. Real GDP surged at a 4.9%
annual rate in the third quarter, while retail sales jumped 1.1% in November. A one-month drop in retail sales
is not unusual. In each of the past five years, retail sales have reported at least three negative months. These
declines are part of the normal volatility of the data, caused by wild swings in oil prices, seasonal
adjustments, or weather. Over-reacting is a mistake.
A year ago, most economic data looked much worse than they do today. Industrial production fell 1.1% during
the six months ending February 2007, while new orders for durable goods fell 3.9% at an annual rate during
the six months ending in November 2006. Real GDP grew just 0.6% in the first quarter of 2007 and retail
sales fell in January and again in April. But the economy came back and roared in the middle of the year --
real GDP expanded 4.4% at an annual rate between April and September.
With housing so weak, the recent softness in production and durable goods orders is understandable. But
housing is now a small share of GDP (4.5%). And it has fallen so much already that it is highly unlikely to
drive the economy into recession all by itself. Exports are 12% of the economy, and are growing at a 13.6%
rate. The boom in exports is overwhelming the loss from housing.
Personal income is up 6.1% during the year ending in November, while small-business income accelerated in
October and November, during the height of the credit crisis. In fact, after subtracting income taxes, rent,
mortgages, car leases and loans, debt service on credit cards and property taxes, incomes rose 3.9% faster
than inflation in the year through September. Commercial paper issuance is rising again, as are mortgage
applications.
Some large companies outside of finance and home building are reporting lower profits, but the over-reaction
to very spotty negative news is astounding. For example, Intel's earnings disappointed, creating a great deal
of fear about technology. Lost in the pessimism is the fact that 20 out of 24 S&P 500 technology companies
that have reported earnings so far have beaten Wall Street estimates.
Models based on recent monetary and tax policy suggest real GDP will grow at a 3% to 3.5% rate in 2008,
while the probability of recession this year is 10%. This was true before recent rate cuts and stimulus
packages. Now that the Fed has cut interest rates by 175 basis points, the odds of a huge surge in growth
later in 2008 have grown. The biggest threat to the economy is still inflation, not recession.
Yet many believe that a recession has already begun because credit markets have seized up. This
pessimistic view argues that losses from the subprime arena are the tip of the iceberg. An economic
downturn, combined with a weakened financial system, will result in a perfect storm for the multi-trillion dollar
derivatives market. It is feared that cascading problems with inter-connected counterparty risk, swaps and
excessive leverage will cause the entire "house of cards," otherwise known as the U.S. financial system, to
collapse. At a minimum, they fear credit will contract, causing a major economic slowdown.
For many, this catastrophic outlook brings back memories of the Great Depression, when bank failures begot
more bank failures, money was scarce, credit was impossible to obtain, and economic problems spread like
wildfire.

--- Page 18 ---
Page 18 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
This outlook is both perplexing and worrisome. Perplexing, because it is hard to see how a campfire of a
problem can spread to burn down the entire forest. What Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently
estimated as a $100 billion loss on subprime loans would represent only 0.1% of the $100 trillion in combined
assets of all U.S. households and U.S. non-farm, non-financial corporations. Even if losses ballooned to $300
billion, it would represent less than 0.3% of total U.S. assets.
Beneath every dollar of counterparty risk, and every swap, derivative, or leveraged loan, is a real economic
asset. The only way credit troubles could spread to take down the entire system is if the economy completely
fell apart. And that only happens when government policy goes wildly off track.
In the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to collapse by 25%, which caused a
dangerous deflation. In turn, this deflation caused massive bank failures. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of
1930, Herbert Hoover's tax hike passed in 1932, and then FDR's alphabet soup of new agencies, regulations
and anticapitalist government activity provided the coup de grace. No wonder thousands of banks failed and
unemployment ballooned to 20%.
But in the U.S. today, the Federal Reserve is extremely accommodative. Not only is the federal funds rate
well below the trend in nominal GDP growth, but real interest rates are low and getting lower. In addition,
gold prices have almost quadrupled during the past six years, while the consumer price index rose more than
4% last year.
These monetary conditions are not conducive to a collapse of credit markets and financial institutions. Any
financial institution that goes under does so because of its own mistakes, not because money was too tight.
Trade protectionism has not become a reality, and while tax hikes have been proposed, Congress has been
unable to push one through.
Which brings up an interesting thought: If the U.S. financial system is really as fragile as many people say,
why should we go to such lengths to save it? If a $100 billion, or even $300 billion, loss in the subprime loan
world can cause the entire system to collapse, maybe we should be working hard to build a better system that
is stronger and more reliable.
Pumping massive amounts of liquidity into the economy and pumping up government spending by giving
money away through rebates may create more problems than it helps to solve. Kicking the can down the road
is not a positive policy.
The irony is almost too much to take. Yesterday everyone was worried about excessive consumer spending,
a lack of saving, exploding debt levels, and federal budget deficits. Today, our government is doing just about
everything in its power to help consumers borrow more at low rates, while it is running up the budget deficit to
get people to spend more. This is the tyranny of the urgent in an election year and it's the development that
investors should really worry about. It reads just like the 1970s.
The good news is that the U.S. financial system is not as fragile as many pundits suggest. Nor is the
economy showing anything other than normal signs of stress. Assuming a 1.5% annualized growth rate in the
fourth quarter, real GDP will have grown by 2.8% in the year ending in December 2007 and 3.2% in the
second half during the height of the so-called credit crunch. Initial unemployment claims, a very consistent
canary in the coal mine for recessions, are nowhere near a level of concern.
Because all debt rests on a foundation of real economic activity, and the real economy is still resilient, the
current red alert about a crashing house of cards looks like another false alarm. Warren Buffett, Wilbur Ross
and Bank of America are buying, and there is still $1.1 trillion in corporate cash on the books. The bench of
potential buyers on the sidelines is deep and strong. Dow 15,000 looks much more likely than Dow 10,000.
Keep the faith and stay invested. It's a wonderful buying opportunity.

Speculation that two more European financial firms will issue profit warnings dragged down the Continent's
banks a day after Societe Generale unveiled $7.2 billion in losses tied to unauthorized trades.
But Asian banks, and Asian markets, posted hefty gains Friday to cap a roller-coaster week, as investors
welcomed details of a tax rebate for U.S. consumers. The extra cash could boost demand for goods from
Asia. The U.S. is the region's largest export market.
In Europe, Belgian-Dutch banking group Fortis slumped 11% and ING Groep dropped 5.2%, both in
Amsterdam, on talk they would be the next victims of the global credit crunch. Both firms declined to
comment.
"Balance sheets of the Benelux stocks may be hit by large losses on subprime assets and lower equity and
real-estate prices, while margins should come down," said Jaap Meijer, banking analyst at Dresdner
Kleinwort.
However, the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index ended the day flat at 322.23, aided by gains in
technology and mining stocks. Overall, it fell 1.6% during a volatile week, its seventh straight weekly decline.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index slipped 0.1%, or 6.80 points, to 5869. Miners jumped after power problems
halted production for many South African miners, sending gold futures soaring. Vedanta Resources surged
7.2%.
In PARIS, the CAC-40 Index shed 0.8%, or 37.17 points, to 4878.12. Societe Generale fell for the third
straight day. Friday's loss of 2.6% means it has lost 21% since speculation of a large write-down first
emerged just over a week ago.
In TOKYO, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies rose 4.1%, or 536.38 points, its largest one-day
percentage gain in nearly six years, to 13629.16, as a weaker yen aided exporters. Honda Motor rose 6.5%.
Financial stocks also were big winners; Mizuho Financial Group added 11%.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index rose 6.7%, or 1583.10 points, to 25122.37, leaving the index down
0.3% on the week. Property developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) climbed 7.5% on hopes that falling interest
rates would further boost demand for residential properties.
In MUMBAI, the 30-stock Sensitive Index jumped 6.6%, or 1139.92 points, its largest one-day percentage
gain since June 15, 2006, to 18361.66.
In SYDNEY, the S&P/ASX 200 climbed 5%, or 279.90 points, its largest one-day percentage gain in more
than a decade, to 5860.30. The index, which snapped a 12-session losing streak earlier in the week, climbed
2% for the week, the first time it has gained in four weeks. It still is down 7.6% this month.

Gold at Another Comex High --- Inflation Concerns Help Lift the Metal To Record $905.50

Gold at Another Comex High --- Inflation Concerns Help Lift the Metal To Record $905.50

A midweek bounce in stocks cleared the way for gold to soar yesterday as investors bought the metal as a
hedge against inflation and a weak U.S. dollar, analysts said.
January-delivery gold gained $23 to $905.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange -- the eighth Comex-record close of the year. Most-active February rose $22.70 to $905.80.
Stocks' weakness early in the week put gold on the defensive as funds sold metals holdings to cover losses
on shares. But this selling was alleviated when the Dow Jones Industrial Average staged a sharp turn higher
Wednesday and also rose yesterday.
"Now that the stock market is stabilizing, [speculators] are probably re-establishing some of those long
positions in gold and silver," said Michael Gross, an analyst at OptionsSellers.com.
Otherwise, gold is underpinned by a Federal Reserve rate cut Tuesday and expectations for another at next
week's Fed meeting. That has put the dollar on the defensive and added to inflation fears, said George
Gero, a vice president at RBC Capital Markets Global Futures. Momentum-based buying was triggered.
Analysts said this week they anticipate buying of gold not only as a "safe haven" against uncertainty in the
credit markets, but because of building inflation worries. Cost pressures may increase, in particular, as
stocks rise, which would hint at improved economic sentiment that encourages banks to lend and consumers
to buy.
"Silver and gold have done a good job of holding together as the stock indices fell apart," said Ira Epstein,
chief executive with Ira Epstein & Co. Futures. "They'll do a phenomenal job to the upside once they believe
the economy is on better footing. The rational for that is all these rate cuts will lead to inflation."
Energy prices are already historically high, and so are many food commodities, in part because of demand for
plant-based biofuels.
"The Fed figures it has a green light to not be too concerned about the inflation story at the moment, so the
Fed is going to feel comfortable with a weaker dollar and stronger metals prices as long as the stock market
goes up," said Ralph Preston, analyst at Heritage West Financial.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices on Nymex rose after the Bush administration and congressional leaders agreed on a
stimulus package designed to avoid a major slowdown in the economy. The stimulus plan outweighed builds
in gasoline and crude-oil stockpiles, as well as a sharp drop in gasoline demand, reported by the Energy
Department in weekly inventory data. March crude settled $2.42 higher at $89.41 a barrel.
NATURAL GAS: Prices ended higher, reversing seven straight sessions of losses as a cold weather forecast
and a government plan to stimulate the economy prompted traders to buy gas on the prospect of increased
demand. Nymex February natural gas rose 18.1 cents to $7.802 per million British thermal units.

Day in the Life of Volatility --- Rally or Just a Bounce? Traders Debate It As Dow Jumps 298.98
Wednesday's Markets
Day in the Life of Volatility --- Rally or Just a Bounce? Traders Debate It As Dow Jumps 298.98

Another day of neck-snapping volatility left the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 298.98 points -- ending five
days of declines and leaving traders debating whether this is a lasting rally or a temporary bounce.
Down 326.38 points at midday, the blue-chip average rebounded amid reports that New York insurance
regulators met with banks to look for ways to support troubled bond insurers with additional capital.
That, together with talk in Washington of creating a fund to buy troubled mortgages, as well as continuing
reaction to Tuesday's Federal Reserve interest-rate cut and hopes for more cuts when the Fed meets next
week, combined to send the Dow industrials up 2.50% by day's end, to 12270.17. It was the best one-day
percentage gain since November.
Trading volume for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange was 7.38 billion shares, a record and more
than twice the average volume in 2007. Nasdaq also saw a record with 3.59 billion shares changing hands.
Traders reported pandemonium on trading floors as investors rushed to change their bets during the day. The
631.86-point, 5% swing from low to high was the biggest such intraday swing since 2002 -- and stocks have
featured big swings for several days now.
"Our phones started to ring more, and suddenly people were speaking with a new sense of urgency," said
Stephen Sachs, director of trading at mutual-fund group Rydex Investments in Rockville, Md. "We listen in to
trading in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures pits on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and you could hear the
volume go up."
On Tuesday, the Dow was down 15.5% from its October record close, closing in on the 20% decline that
would signal a bear market. It was even closer to a bear before the midday rebound yesterday. It finished the
day 13.4% off the record.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which like other major indexes also finished with a strong gain, was in
bear-market territory during the day, but finished 19% below its recent high, short of a bear.
The big question is whether Tuesday's strong finish will mark the end of the current downdraft, or just a pause
before the declines resume. Many traders were skeptical that the selling is over.
"I still think the risks are to the downside," said Mr. Sachs of Rydex, noting that "ripping rallies" of this sort are
common during bear markets. "Ultimately I think these are bear-market rallies, bear traps," he said.
This rally was fueled in part by short sellers, investors who try to profit from falling markets by borrowing stock
and selling it in hopes of buying it back cheaper after it declines. They take profits by buying shares back after
they fall and returning them to brokerage firms. This can help fuel rallies, especially in declining markets.
Traders said some of the buying was technical. Technical analysts had identified 1270 on the Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index as a support-point for stocks, based on past trading. Some short-term traders started
buying when the S&P 500 neared that level, and 1270.05 proved the index's low for the day. The S&P 500
finished ahead 2.14%, or 28.10 points, at 1338.60, 14.5% off its October record.
The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.05%, or 24.14 points, to 2316.41, weighed down by disappointing
forecasts late Tuesday from Apple. Technology stocks were mixed on the day due to some disappointing
quarterly results, and Apple itself finished down more than 10%. Microsoft fell slightly and Intel rose more
than 7%.
The Dow Jones Transportation Average, which already had fallen into a bear market, rebounded 7%, its
biggest percentage gain since 1989.

Commodity futures, including oil, gasoline, gold and copper, declined, but Treasury-bond prices rose.
Among the day's big stock gainers were banks and other financial companies, which benefit most directly
from Fed rate cuts that reduce their cost of obtaining funds from depositors and other sources. Banks already
had risen Tuesday following the Fed rate cut, bucking that day's overall market decline. Yesterday, Citigroup
was up 8% and J.P. Morgan Chase rose 11.9%. Banks remained well off their highs, however.
Other beaten-down stocks also surged, including homebuilders and bond insurers. Bond-insurer Ambac
jumped 71.9% while MBIA, also an insurer, rose 32.6%.
Investors had feared the bond insurers would be further downgraded by credit-rating firms, reducing their
ability to insure bonds and possibly forcing bond holders to sell more. If they are shored up, said Todd Clark,
director of stock trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco, it would remove "one of the big
uncertainties surrounding things. That would be good, and we can rally," he said, adding that he was
impressed by the day's trading volume and strength of the market's upturn.
Some investors took a "show me" attitude. "One hour, one day does not make a new rally or a new trend,"
said Steven Wolf, managing director for investments at Source Capital Group in Westport, Conn.
But others were more hopeful. "This market has become focused, almost to the hypnotic sense, on the Fed,"
said Steven Grasso of brokerage firm Stuart Frankel, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He said
expectations in the market -- where he believes selloffs have been overdone -- are for a half-percentage-point
cut of the Fed's target short-term lending rate at its policy-making meeting next week.
James Maguire Jr., vice president at Christopher J. Forbes LLC on the NYSE floor, was forecasting a lift for
the market in the morning, before the rally began. But he added, "The broader issues that are troubling this
market are going to be with us."

Citigroup and Bank of America Surge --- Apple, Motorola Fall On Weak Forecasts; Brinker Jumps 22%
Abreast of the Market
Citigroup and Bank of America Surge --- Apple, Motorola Fall On Weak Forecasts; Brinker Jumps 22%

A late-afternoon surge propelled stocks sharply higher as Citigroup and other financials jumped, but Apple
and Motorola were beaten down after disappointing forecasts.
A big boost for the bond insurers and the broad stock market was news that regulators at the New York
Insurance Department met yesterday with banks that are parties to contracts with bond insurers to discuss
ways of stabilizing the business and bringing in additional capital and capacity. Bond insurers are key to other
parts of the financial market like municipal bonds and bank stocks.
"You have to realize the market is extremely oversold," said Bruce Brittles, chief investment strategist at RW
Baird. "We had a big cut by the Federal Reserve and they are likely to cut rates again when they meet." He
said the fact that the beaten-down financial and retail stocks were able to move higher over the past two days
encouraged short covering elsewhere.
Some of the worst-performing stocks of the past year, like bond insurers, banks, home builders and
consumer-discretionary firms surged yesterday. While Tuesday's rate cut by the Federal Reserve failed to
shore up the market in the first half of the day, the major indexes recovered late afternoon amid a recovery in
transportation stocks and a ratings upgrade for the banks from Bear Stearns.
Apple (Nasdaq) fell $16.57, or 11%, to $139.07. The company posted a jump in fiscal-first-quarter net
income, helped by strong sales of Macintosh computers and wider margins. But the iPod maker's
second-quarter outlook fell well short of Wall Street's expectations.
Banking stocks rallied for the second straight day, continuing to benefit from hopes the Fed's rate cut will help
pad profits. An analyst at Bear Stearns, upgraded his rating on large-cap banks to "market overweight" from
"market underweight" yesterday. Wachovia jumped 3.39, or 11%, to 35.30; Bank of America rose 3.18, or
8.5%, to 40.57; J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. gained 4.86, or 12%, to 45.72 and Citigroup added 1.96, or 8%, to
26.36.
Motorola plunged 2.31, or 19%, to 10.01. The company exceeded estimates for fourth-quarter profit but said
a steep drop in sales of its mobile phones will contribute to an expected loss for the current quarter.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 4.22, or 5%, to 77.30. The mining company's fourth-quarter net
income fell 2.8% amid charges, including those related to the company's purchase of Phelps Dodge.
General Motors rose 2.05, or 8.7%, to 25.70, helping to prop up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Beaten-down retail and housing stocks also gained. Home Depot rose 1.75, or 6.2%, to 29.95, and Toll
Brothers added 2.47, or 14%, to 20.56.
Brinker International rose 3.31, or 22%, to 18.63. The restaurant company's fiscal-second-quarter net income
rose 23% on divestiture gains, despite same-store sales numbers that continue to flag.
Tyco International rose 2.68, or 7.9%, to 36.40. The manufacturing and services company issued preliminary
fiscal-first-quarter results and boosted its fiscal-year expectations.
PetSmart (Nasdaq) fell 29 cents, or 1.3%, to 22.76. The pet-food and supplies company lowered its earnings
forecast to a range of 57 cents to 61 cents a share from 70 cents to 74 cents.
Ciena (Nasdaq) lost 3.34, or 13%, to 22.83. The telecommunications-equipment maker agreed to buy
privately held World Wide Packets for about $200 million in cash and 3.4 million shares of Ciena stock.

Oil, at $86.99 a Barrel, Hits Three-Month Low

Oil, at $86.99 a Barrel, Hits Three-Month Low

Crude-oil futures slumped 2.5% to their lowest close in three months as traders foresaw a weaker U.S.
economy cooling oil demand growth.
Light, sweet crude for March delivery closed $2.22 lower to settle at $86.99 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
Crude prices fell a day after the Federal Reserve announced an emergency three-quarter percentage-point
cut in interest rates. Traders took that move more as evidence of economic weakness in the world's most
voracious energy consumer than a sign Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will be able to forestall a recession.
Oil markets moved in tandem with equities for much of the day, though the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
pared most of its losses by the Nymex's 2:30 p.m. EST settlement time and closed almost 299 points higher.
Though stocks and commodities don't necessarily track one another, crude traders said they took the stock
market's early tumble as bad news for the economy.
The Nymex close was the lowest for a front-month contract since Oct. 23, when the New York contract settled
at $85.27 a barrel. Oil prices soared after that, peaking briefly at $100.09 a barrel, as the market reacted to
threats to supplies, a weaker dollar and strong demand growth in Asia and the Mideast.
But mounting signs the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession have shifted focus toward threats to
demand. A new report from MasterCard Advisors LLC showing that U.S. gasoline demand declined last week
reinforced concerns that consumers may be easing on purchases of oil products.
"Energy prices are much more a barometer of economic sentiment and capital-market conditions than a
mirror image of overall supply conditions," said Mike Fitzpatrick, an analyst at brokerage MF Global, wrote to
clients. "The price descent may prove brutally swift."
The economic impact of higher oil prices adds pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to raise output quotas at its meeting in Vienna next Friday. But crude's recent pullback, financial
market volatility and typically lower demand in the second quarter of the year make an increase unlikely,
many analysts say.
In other commodity markets:
COPPER: Prices slid as market participants remained focused on the slowing of the U.S. economy. Copper is
used in industrial applications, so concerns over a recession would hurt the red metal's demand. January
copper on the Comex division of the Nymex fell 12.55 cents per pound to $3.0635.
GOLD: Futures fell as traders continued to liquidate metals positions to raise money during the stock market
selloff. January Comex gold slid $7.10 per troy ounce to $882.50.

Stocks Show Classic Bear Signals, And This Time, Impact Is Global
Stocks Show Classic Bear Signals, And This Time, Impact Is Global

A classic bear market starts with a period of exuberance. Then a downturn hits one part of the market, and
gradually, the losses spread even to strong companies. A prolonged grind begins.
It happened in the 1970s, when an oil embargo helped puncture the "nifty fifty" big-company stocks, and
again in 2001, when the bursting of the Internet bubble caused a broad decline. Now, investors shaken by
two days of severe volatility fear another bear market -- only this time, it would fully span the globe.
Even as some world-wide markets recovered yesterday on the back of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate
cut, the losses have put some markets already in bear territory by the traditional definition of a 20% drop from
a high.
The Russell 2000 small-stock index, bank-stock indexes and the Dow Jones Transportation Average already
are down more than 20% from last year's highs. So are benchmark indexes from Switzerland to Taiwan to
Chile.
The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.04% yesterday and now is 19.8% off last year's high. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average is 15.5% below last October's record. Indexes in India and China are getting close to the
20% mark.
Some investors don't think a lengthy bear market is upon us. They believe the worst may be over as the Fed
moves aggressively to prop up the U.S. economy. Yesterday, markets around the world bounced back, with
London rising 2.9% and Brazil 4.5%. Tokyo shares were up more than 3% in trading this morning. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average recovered significantly from big losses shortly after the opening bell, though it still
finished the day down a little more than 1%.
Bears see a much longer working-out of the distortions that developed this decade as the U.S., along with
many other nations, went through a burst of housing exuberance. Home prices surged far beyond historic
levels relative to income. Stocks in home builders, mortgage companies and financial institutions cashing in
on the boom all benefited.
Confident U.S. consumers fed -- and were fed by -- a broader boom abroad, particularly in developing
markets such as China and India. Exports from Asian countries excluding Japan grew to 55% of their total
economic output in 2005 from 45% in 2001, according to the Asian Development Bank. The lion's share of
those exports -- about 60% -- end up in the U.S., Europe and Japan.
"We are all still tied together one way or another, either psychologically or through trade," said Hans Utsch,
who manages the $10.5 billion Federated Kaufmann Fund, which focuses on U.S. midcap stocks but also has
15% of its portfolio in Indian shares. "Only if you're living in a dream world do you say, 'I'm immune.'"
The current market looks a lot like the beginning of past bear markets, said Paul Desmond, president of
market-research firm Lowry's Reports in North Palm Beach, Fla. First, the most troubled stocks decline --
home builders and financial stocks in the current case -- and then others gradually get hit, including small
stocks, retailers and technology stocks. Finally even stocks of strong companies are affected.
Japanese companies, for example, are historically cheap relative to profits, which are rising for a sixth
consecutive year. Yet Toyota Motor Co., the world's most profitable car maker, plunged 7.2% yesterday.
"There's a crisis of confidence at the moment," said Khiem Do, portfolio manager at Baring Asset
Management, which manages about $13 billion in Asia. "In fact, good stocks with strong fundamentals are
getting routed because people want to lock in profits."
As a bear market develops, Mr. Desmond says, trading volume and price movement get heavier and heavier
for stocks that are declining, and lighter and lighter on the buying side, as more investors look for a way out.

--- Page 31 ---
Page 31 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
When the selling reaches a climax, the bear market is nearing an end, but Mr. Desmond says he doesn't see
any sign of a climax yet.
"We feel we have been in a bear market since July. Everything that we have seen since then has just been a
progression, almost like a disease that you are monitoring and the disease is spreading," he says. "We are
still a long way from a major bottom."
He is watching for a sign of panic selling, but says it hasn't gotten to that point yet. "Everything we are seeing
looks like a typical bear market," he says.
Yesterday, even commodities including oil and copper declined, amid concerns about slower world growth.
Investors put money into refuges including gold and Treasury bonds, pushing their prices higher.
The Fed's move yesterday was hastened by the world-wide market plunge on Monday, when U.S. markets
were closed. While some investors thought the Fed's move looked panicky, others liked it because rate cuts
reinforce the Fed's willingness to support the economy despite inflation risks.
One silver lining to the links among world markets: If the Fed rate cuts do blunt the credit crisis and support
growth, that should benefit markets world-wide. The U.S. is still by far the biggest, strongest economy in the
world. If Americans begin spending and borrowing again, then economies and markets around the world will
benefit.
Investors around the world had their eyes on the Fed yesterday. After the Fed news hit, "everyone was trying
to buy and our order screens were full. Then within minutes, that euphoria evaporated," said Martin Slaney,
head of derivatives at GFT Global Markets in London. European markets continued to gyrate, although they
recovered from the day's lows and many finished with gains for the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 464.48 points, or 3.84%, shortly after the opening bell. It
finished down 128.11 points, or 1.06%, at 11971.19, the first finish below 12000 in more than a year. Total
trading in New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks hit 6.42 billion shares, the second-heaviest day ever, after
last Aug. 16.
Some more-optimistic investors were beginning to buy already, and others were looking for buying
opportunities.
Uri Landesman, a senior portfolio manager at ING Investment Management in New York, said he slept fitfully
Monday night, with some of his international stocks showing double-digit declines. Yesterday, he went
through all of his holdings and came up with seven potential stocks to sell and to buy, but decided to do
nothing -- for now. "Anything I want to sell is already oversold," he says. As for buying, he's waiting to see if
markets steady.
Investment strategist Thomas McManus of Banc of America Securities, who last year had urged clients to pull
back from stocks, recommended that they buy beaten-down shares, boosting their stock holdings by 5%.
U.S. banking stocks, which have been among the hardest-hit in the selloff, staged a recovery yesterday, in
part on hopes the rate cut will improve their profit margins.

Managing a Panic
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Managing a Panic

Yesterday's emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve seems to have stalled a global selloff in equity
markets, and for that we can be grateful. We'd have preferred a narrower pledge of liquidity for all comers
through the discount window, but then riding shotgun in a stampede can sometimes call for improvisation.
And such a panic is unfortunately what we have. The Fed explained its 75-basis-point move a week before its
regular meeting "in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth."
The central bankers are especially worried that struggling regional banks have stopped lending to small and
medium-sized businesses, which are the U.S. economy's chief job creators. The job market has been the last
bastion of growth amid the housing recession and credit crunch, so the Fed's concern is understandable.
The rate cut will reduce the cost of borrowing by lowering mortgage and other benchmark interest rates. In
the best case, the lower cost of capital will give banks more confidence to lend, and in the process increase
the demand for money, which might ease any inflationary pressures from monetary easing. As we say, this is
the best case.
The worst part of yesterday's decision is that it looked like more Fed appeasement of banks and equity
traders, suggesting even a hint of panic by the Fed itself. Chairman Ben Bernanke had already signaled that
the Fed would cut rates sharply at its regular meeting next week, and in retrospect that candor only invited
more Wall Street agitation to speed it up. Mr. Bernanke's interest in more Fed transparency is admirable, but
we'd prefer if he saved his explanations for when he acts.
Yesterday's move might also have had more credibility if it had been coordinated with the European Central
Bank. It speaks volumes that ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has so far declined to follow the Fed's
rate-cutting lead. Either Mr. Trichet doesn't think Europe's credit problems are all that serious, or perhaps he
thinks the Fed's policy is misguided. This has given the Fed less protection against a further reduction in the
dollar's value against the euro, and could yet inspire more trade tensions. Mr. Bernanke's dollar diplomacy
could stand improvement.
The larger risk is that these rate cuts will contribute to a further flight from the dollar, along with more inflation
down the road. Gold jumped yesterday, but on the other hand oil fell, perhaps on expectations of lower
demand from slower global growth. Commodity prices and foreign-exchange markets bear watching in the
coming weeks, and if they spike we'll know that investors expect the Fed will keep bowing to political
pressure.
Futures markets are already pricing in further rate cuts deep into 2008. This is hardly a vote of confidence in
the Fed, and our advice would be that if Mr. Bernanke wants to cut further he do so fast and be done with it.
This would shift market expectations that still-lower borrowing costs aren't coming, and would itself help to
revive lending.
Above all, Mr. Bernanke needs to be clear with everyone -- Congress, Wall Street, investors -- that easier
money is not some magic elixir for the underlying problem of bank insolvency. The credit and real estate
losses are real and have to be dealt with. This requires slow and steady workouts, raising new capital, and in
some cases regulatory action to arrange mergers and rescue institutions whose failure could lead to
problems in the larger banking system.
This is the advantage that the discount window provides, both providing liquidity to those in need and giving
the Fed information about which institutions are in trouble and why. Unlike rate cuts, this is not glamorous
work. But it is the best way to deal with insolvency while running the fewest systemic risks.
It would also help if President Bush and Congress both took a hint from the market selloff following their
"stimulus" announcements late last week. Investors clearly view the tax rebates and new spending as useless
in promoting growth. The White House signaled yesterday that Mr. Bush may be open to a larger package

--- Page 34 ---
Page 34 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
than his $150 billion proposal, but size isn't the issue. The problem is his reliance on "temporary" Keynesian
nostrums that won't increase incentives to invest and take risks. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's defense
of the package yesterday was, well, let's be kind and call it uninformed.
If Mr. Bush really wants to change the terms of the economic debate, he'd use his State of the Union address
to make the case for a tax cut stimulus that is marginal, immediate and permanent. No doubt Members of
Congress are saying that can't pass, and some in the White House want to be able to point to a legislative
"stimulus" victory in an election year. But if the economy stays weak, Democrats will still blame the White
House.
None of this is making life any easier for Mr. Bernanke. But sooner or later he has to make clear that
managing a panic requires as much discipline as liquidity.

Corrections & Amplifications
Howard Schwab became a co-manager of the Driehaus Emerging Markets Growth Fund in August 2007, and
became its lead manager at the start of this year. An article Wednesday about fund managers' investing
strategies incorrectly implied that he was the lead manager of the fund last year.
(WSJ Jan. 25, 2008)
(END)
The market turmoil is forcing money managers across the spectrum to re-examine their holdings as they look
for an edge.
Here are the views of five mutual-fund managers with specialties in specific sectors:
Emerging-Market Worries
Emerging markets were the belle of the investing ball in 2007. Now the music has stopped.
Howard Schwab, who heads Driehaus Emerging Markets Growth Fund, piloted the portfolio to a 42% gain in
2007. As of yesterday it was down about 17% for the year.
Mr. Schwab doesn't expect these markets to bounce back right away. "This is more of a trend change," he
says, rather than a short-lived correction.
Mr. Schwab recently unloaded holdings, such as a Chinese milk company, amid worries that it wouldn't be
able to pass along rapidly rising costs to customers.
At the same time, he is increasing his stake in firms that are in good position to weather the global
environment, but which still got punished. One such firm: India's Reliance Communications Ltd., a
telecommunications company whose shares fell more than 20% in two days.
Mr. Schwab says markets such as China, which did exceptionally well last year, look less attractive now.
Instead, he is looking at places such as Taiwan and Thailand, last year's laggards.
-- Joanna Slater
Technology Shocks
Tech stocks have taken a beating, but Bob Turner, lead manager of Turner Core Growth Fund, still thinks
there is potential this year.
While the tech-stock-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down more than 10% this year, Mr. Turner points to many
companies trading at attractive prices when compared to their earnings growth rates. In particular, stocks
such as Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., Nokia Corp. and International Business Machines
Corp. can be appealing "even if U.S. economic growth slows," given many such firms garner half their sales
abroad.
One challenge: earnings. Disappointing earnings from Intel Corp. last week, for instance, has pressured the
stock, which is down about 30% so far this year. Yesterday, Apple Inc.'s stock fell in after-hours trading
despite a 57% rise in fiscal first-quarter net income since the company's second-quarter forecast fell below
expectations.

--- Page 36 ---
Page 36 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Such market-sensitivity and other issues could mean it is best to stay focused on larger, rather than small or
midsize, tech stocks in coming months, Mr. Turner says.
-- Diya Gullapalli
Recession Protection
Jeff Tyler, a portfolio manager for American Century Investments, predicts a "modest recession" for the first
half. So he is shopping for companies that sell essentials.
"Drug companies, for instance," he says. "You need your heart medication. Just because the stock market is
off doesn't mean you don't need it. If anything, you need it more."
Mr. Tyler is manager of the Kansas City company's asset-allocation mutual funds, which attempt to manage
returns by using different asset-allocation strategies depending on economic conditions. His American
Century Strategic Allocation Fund/Moderate Investor returned 4.05% in the past 12 months, six percentage
points ahead of the market, says fund watcher Morningstar Inc.
This year his strategy had been to go light on stocks (he has cut holdings to 54% from 60%) keeping the rest
in cash and bonds with high credit ratings. But yesterday's market called for a shift back to more stocks, he
says. "The markets historically do pretty well in the three-month and one-year horizons following a surprise
Fed move."
-- Jennifer Levitz
The Commodity Boom
Amid the historic commodity boom of recent years, the recent market turmoil is creating a few opportunities,
says money manager Evan Smith.
Mr. Smith co-manages the $1.6-billion U.S. Global Investors' Global Resources Fund, which invests in stocks
of companies involved in producing and mining oil, gold and other and materials. The fund was up 40% last
year, but is down 13% this year.
He says the selloff in the commodity-company stocks is "exaggerated" given that the price of oil and gold is
still near records.
The Texas-based manager says in the long term he remains bullish on prospects for oil, gold and commodity
companies in the agriculture and fertilizer businesses, given that demand from China and other developing
countries should remain strong.
"Overall, there's a good buying opportunity for longer-term investors," says Mr. Smith.
Last year's run-up made stocks like these very expensive to buy, but that's changing slightly. For instance,
Chinese energy company PetroChina Co.'s stock nearly doubled between August and October last year, but
has since come down significantly. Mr. Smith says he is now looking to buy.
-- Shefali Anand
Time to Bond?
When asked yesterday where bond investors should focus right now given the turmoil in markets and the
Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut, Robert Auwaerter, head of fixed income at Vanguard Group, offered two
main answers: high-quality corporate and municipal bonds.
Often in a volatile market, safe Treasury bonds can seem like the best bet. However, these days nervous
investors have already been flocking to Treasurys, which pushes their prices higher (and yields down).
Two-year Treasury notes are offering about 2% yields, a multiyear low.
Mr. Auwaerter says a better choice could be investment-grade debt in industries that can withstand a
recession. This includes electric-utility companies or conglomerates such as General Electric Co. One recent
new issuance of DuPont Co. bonds that come due in early 2013, for instance, offered a juicy 5% coupon.
Top-quality municipal bonds are similarly offering generous yields compared with Treasurys.

Silver Rises, Still Plays Second Fiddle --- Metal Is Also-Ran As the Price of Gold Surges to New Highs

Silver Rises, Still Plays Second Fiddle --- Metal Is Also-Ran As the Price of Gold Surges to New Highs

Silver often is in the shadow of gold when it comes to precious metals, and its also-ran status over the past
year has continued as gold prices race to highs.
That isn't to say that silver prices haven't strengthened in the commodity markets' recent rally. Silver has
moved up since the end of 2006, but its gains are lagging behind those of gold.
At last week's record listed by one price vendor as $914.40 an ounce, spot gold was up 44% from the end of
2006. Meanwhile, silver's recent 28-year high of $16.60 was up 29%. Friday, nearby January silver rose 20.8
cents to $16.138 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Nearby but lightly traded
January gold futures settled up $1.30 at $880.80 an ounce.
Gold and other precious metals have been aided by a weak dollar undercut by Federal Reserve rate cuts,
fears of inflation, global tensions and haven buying owing to worries about the credit markets.
U.S. markets were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Prices of both metals fell in
London along with a broad selloff in financial markets.
Bill O'Neill, principal with Logic Advisors, said much of the rally in gold has been from a "flight to quality"
during subprime concerns and a plunge in the dollar. Silver tends to draw less buying based on this, he said.
"Gold should in fact outperform," Mr. O'Neill said. Silver tends to draw more speculators, while gold tends to
draw more of an investment element, he added.
The gold/silver ratio -- determined by dividing the per-ounce price of gold by the price of silver -- has
increased to 55 from around 49 at the end of 2006, meaning gold outperformed. The average since 1970 has
been 54, said Gijsbert Groenewegen, managing partner of Gold Arrow Capital Management.
"To be honest, [the ratio has] been balancing out the movements we saw the year before," said James
Moore, analyst with TheBullionDesk.com.
Silver prices rose more than 40% in 2006, helped in large part by the launch of the first major silver
exchange-traded fund by Barclays Capital. Investors can buy iShares that trade similarly to a stock but are
backed by metal stored in vaults, thereby increasing actual physical demand. The gold/silver ratio fell from
around 58 at the end of 2005 to 49 at the end of 2006.
In the past two months, open interest for gold futures on the Comex division of the Nymex has risen more
than silver's, said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures. Open interest is the
number of outstanding positions in a contract at the end of the day's trade.
"People are saying, 'If silver is poor man's gold, we might as well buy the gold,'" Mr. Gero said.
Silver could do better, though. "My view is that silver is still the underdog of the two metals," Mr. Moore said.

Credit Scare Spreads in U.S., Abroad --- Fears of a Recession Spark a Global Selloff; New Pressure on the Fed
Credit Scare Spreads in U.S., Abroad --- Fears of a Recession Spark a Global Selloff; New Pressure on
the Fed

A world-wide stock selloff suggested that recession fears are spreading beyond the U.S., and that the
downturn in U.S. markets is dragging down share prices abroad.
While U.S. markets were closed yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, major indexes fell 7.2% in
Germany, 7.4% in India and 5.5% in Britain.
That follows what has been a bad run for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which on Friday finished at
12099.30, 15% off its record close of 14164.53 in October. The Dow is now uncomfortably near the 20%
decline analysts commonly consider the mark of a bear market. Futures on the blue-chip average fell 4.3%
yesterday in London trading.
American investors have shifted billions of dollars abroad in hopes that booming economies in Asia and Latin
America would shake off economic woes in the U.S. and keep the world out of recession. But the drop in
foreign markets is stoking worries that no stock market will be spared. This morning in Asia, major markets
opened broadly lower.
The unraveling markets are boosting the pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to slash
interest rates to counter the threat of recession in the U.S. Fed policy makers meet next week, and it
appears almost certain they will cut the central bank's short-term rate target, now at 4.25%, by at least a half
percentage point. Officials will likely give close consideration to a three-quarters-point cut.
A cut before then isn't considered likely, but can't be ruled out if markets suffer badly. A rate cut just a week
ahead of the Fed's meeting would deliver only a modest additional boost to the economy and could risk
looking panicked.
For many months, flows of U.S. investment money to mutual funds investing abroad have dwarfed flows to
U.S. stock funds. In November, the latest month for which figures are available, funds investing overseas took
in a net $4.46 billion, while funds investing in the U.S. saw an outflow of $15.34 billion, according to the
Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund trade group.
That trend is now reversing. U.S. and European investors, seeking to preserve their gains, are repatriating
money they invested in the developing world, helping drive those markets lower, analysts say. Andrew Freris,
chief Asian economist at BNP Paribas, said much of yesterday's 5.5% plunge in Hong Kong-listed stocks
probably was triggered by funds based in the U.S. and Europe retreating from what is one of Asia's deepest
and most liquid markets.
Turmoil in overseas markets potentially tarnishes one bright spot for the U.S. economy: its relatively strong
exports. But Fed officials seem likely to conclude this turmoil overstates the actual risks those countries'
economies face, leaving the Fed unlikely to alter its own forecast materially. Fed officials' greater concern
remains the domestic economy and the threat of a self-perpetuating cycle of tighter lending, reduced
spending and employment, lower home prices and increased loan defaults.
Skeptics have warned for months that developing-country stocks looked like a bubble waiting to burst. When
Russell Indexes searched its global stock database for last year's best-performing shares in dollar terms, 48
of the top 100 stocks were from India, China, Brazil or Russia -- with 41 from India alone. Only six U.S.-based
stocks made the list.
The benchmark indexes of India, Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia all climbed more than 40% last year. In China,
a speculative frenzy helped push the Shanghai Composite Index 97% in 2007, even though the market is
largely closed to foreign investors.

Many analysts believe the 30-stock Dow average is overdue for at least a temporary rebound, but so far there
has been little sign of strength. U.S. stocks remain under serious pressure as once-bullish investors sell
shares and shift money to cash, Treasury bonds and gold, seeking safety. Futures on U.S. stock
benchmarks such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and on the largest stocks in the Nasdaq
Composite Index fell heavily in London yesterday.
"It does feel like there is panic out there, and there is little sense that it is bottoming out," said Lucy
MacDonald, chief investment officer of global equities at RCM Ltd. in London. Ms. MacDonald, like many
market participants, believes that the declines probably will continue through at least the end of this week,
and that U.S. and European interest-rate cuts will be needed to pick markets up.
But foreign markets and futures trading historically have been unreliable predictors of U.S. stock action.
Foreign markets typically react to developments in the U.S., rather than the other way around. In the year
through October 2007, Brazilian stocks moved in the same direction as the S&P 500 more than 90% of the
time, according to data from Citigroup. For Indian stocks, it was 70%.
Today's U.S. trading is likely to be influenced by a new batch of profit and economic reports. Ambac Financial
Group Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Bank of America Corp., DuPont Co., Johnson & Johnson and Wachovia
Corp. all are scheduled to post quarterly results today. If U.S. stocks rebound, foreign markets could well
follow.
Strategists at Morgan Stanley told clients yesterday, however, to stay in cash. "We expect flat but volatile
markets just as in the 1989-92 period -- a real whipsaw environment for the market," the Morgan Stanley
report said.
Stock indexes in Britain, Germany and France suffered their heaviest percentage declines since Sept. 11,
2001, and in Hong Kong, the largest since Sept. 12, 2001. Indexes yesterday fell 3.9% in Japan, 5.1% in
China and 6.6% in Brazil. Hong Kong-listed shares in Chinese companies fell more than 7%.
The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index, which has fallen for six consecutive weeks, dropped an
additional 5.7% to 308.77.
The dollar, in decline for years, rebounded 1.2% against the euro yesterday amid growing concerns that the
European Central Bank would be forced to cut interest rates to support local economies. The dollar fell
against the yen.
Fears that emerging markets might not be strong enough to keep the world out of recession knocked down a
variety of industrial commodities tied to global growth. Copper was trading around 5% lower on the London
Metal Exchange, while oil fell $1.97 a barrel to $88.60 in late-day electronic trading.
The dollar's strength in Europe supported it against gold, and gold, which has been pulling back as investors
cashed in winnings after it surpassed $900 a troy ounce early this month, fell $8.30 to $872.50 in late-day
electronic trading, the lowest in about two weeks.
Mining shares also fell. Vedanta Resources PLC dropped 12.1% and Rio Tinto PLC shed 10%.
Leading European financial companies were among the day's big losers, amid fears that they haven't finished
taking write-offs. France's Societe Generale fell 7.8%, on top of a decline of almost 8% Friday; BNP Paribas
was down 8.5%. WestLB of Germany added to concerns by saying it would have a loss of about $1.5 billion
this year and take a write-off of similar size.
The head of France's central bank, Christian Noyer, said that French banks "clearly, like all banks in the
world still [are] in the process of marking down assets."
Fears spread that bond-insurance companies could suffer further credit downgrades, hurting banks' ability to
collect on battered securities. Bond insurers insure about $2.4 trillion of debt, including $100 billion of
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime loans, and further downgrades and the forced sales of
bonds that would follow are a serious risk to credit markets, said UniCredit strategist Jochen Felsenheimer.
The Markit iTraxx Europe index, a widely followed benchmark that measures the cost of protecting bonds
against default, rose to a record yesterday.
Some sectors that had been refuges for investors suffered in the selloff, including high-dividend stocks.
"Some of the defensive stocks, such as utilities, are starting to crack now," as people lock in recent profits,
said Bruno Berry, a fund manager at Morley Fund Management in London. "It is difficult to find a safe
haven."
Among the rare gainers were government bonds, as investors fled to them for shelter.

Once sought-after markets in developing countries were among yesterday's hardest hit. Analysts said those
markets could extend their losses if investors who poured money into Latin America, Asia and Central Europe
in recent years grow increasingly averse to betting on the historically volatile regions.
Brazil has been an investor favorite because of its soaring sales to China. Investors betting on the export
boom helped push Brazilian stocks up more than sixfold since 2002. The exports could slow if China's
economic expansion cools in a global slowdown.
In Mexico, which gets nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product from exports to the U.S. and has the
greatest exposure to a U.S. recession, stocks already are down more than 20% from their October high.
Some investors think Latin America's economies will weather the global shake-out better than in the past,
when the region was plagued by financial crises and debt defaults. Countries such as Brazil, Mexico and
Chile have boosted currency reserves, reduced their foreign-debt burdens and tamed inflation in recent
years, improving their economic vigor.
Investors abroad shrugged off President Bush's economic stimulus package announced Friday and focused
instead on their own failure to see the trouble brewing. "Global negative cues were ignored for quite some
time, and now it caught up," said Ketan Karani, vice president for research at Kotak Securities in Mumbai,
India.
Compounding the downward pressure in India was the launch of new initial public offerings. Many investors
cashed out of stocks in the major market indexes to divert funds to those offerings, particularly that of
Reliance Power Ltd., which allocated $3 billion in shares to investors last week in India's largest-ever IPO.
Elaine Chu, an analyst with Citi Investment Research in Hong Kong, noted in a report to investors yesterday
that institutional funds were still flowing out of Asia and that these outflows "have not peaked," despite five
consecutive weeks of net redemptions from offshore Asian funds. If that pessimism persists, she said,
redemptions could exceed $8 billion in coming weeks as global investors seek safer bets.

The World Melts for Gold --- Futures in China, an ETF in India Are Part of the Frenzy
The World Melts for Gold --- Futures in China, an ETF in India Are Part of the Frenzy

Gold-bug fever is spreading.
From China to the Middle East, new ways to invest in gold are rapidly popping up in developing countries. It's
transforming the market for one of mankind's most venerable ways to sock away wealth.
The door is opening to a new class of investors who previously wouldn't have had access to gold futures
and other tools. Their rush to invest has helped fuel soaring prices -- gold crossed $900 an ounce for a time
in the past week, and there are some calls for $1,000 -- while adding volatile new dynamics to the market.
On Jan. 9, thousands of Chinese investors jumped into the bullion market when the country's first
gold-futures contract launched. Futures are agreements to buy or sell something at an agreed-upon price in
the future, and are traditionally the domain of the pros, not individuals. So far, it's been a bumpy road: The
most active June contract soared 6.3% on its debut day, then tumbled 3.7% on Day 2.
A slew of other new investments like these are planned in markets from Dubai to Mumbai. In India, the top
lender, State Bank of India, plans this year to launch an exchange-traded fund that focuses on gold --
enabling investors to trade gold much like a regular stock. The World Gold Council, a London-based
gold-mining industry group, says it is seeking to roll out its first gold ETF in Dubai this year, pending
regulatory approval.
Last August, the Osaka Securities Exchange in Japan rolled out a gold-linked bond aimed at smaller
investors. And in the past few days, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. said it plans to list gold-related
investment products and ETFs on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Another sign of the shifting power centers in world gold markets: Last year, China became the world's No. 1
producer of gold, pushing South Africa into second place for the first time in more than a century, according
to GFMS Ltd., a precious-metals consulting firm in London.
The democratization of gold speculation outside traditional Western financial centers has the potential to
magnify the already strong appeal of gold as a hedge against global recession, inflation or just general
uncertainty.
Investors world-wide shifted billions of dollars into new gold investments last year, fueling a 31% increase in
the price of bullion on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's most important
gold market. The anticipation that greater Chinese participation could be bullish for the market over the long
term helped keep Comex gold above the psychological hurdle of $900 earlier in the week.
Uncertainty over future U.S. interest-rate cuts, among other factors, has since pulled the Comex benchmark
back to $880.80..
Individuals in India and other Asian countries have stockpiled gold jewelry and bars. In China -- a nation with
a rich history of economic upheaval -- gold has long been a particularly popular savings tool. Various colorful
frauds have flourished, too. In January, a man named Ka Yulong, who ran a gold-trading firm in Western
China's Gansu province, was sentenced to 15 years for swindling investors by selling them gold-plated silver
bullion.
Last August, a swindler in Hebei province was convicted of scamming an investor out of $21,000 by
spreading gold dust on stones that he pretended were samples from his mine.
In one of the largest recent scandals, a Shanghai trading firm, Liantai Gold Products Co., managed to find a
way to trade gold-futures contracts overseas -- circumventing Chinese law -- only to lose millions of dollars
of its clients' money in the process. Liantai's total trading volume once reached a remarkable 11.9 billion yuan
($1.64 billion), according to court documents. The case is pending.

Until recently, most buying and selling of gold in China required lugging the metal between brokers and
haggling over prices. As recently as a decade or so ago, when Chinese tourists were first permitted to travel
to Hong Kong in significant numbers, they often descended first on gold shops in the former British colony to
stock up.
Only in 2002 did investors in China get the ability to trade physical gold on the Shanghai Gold Exchange,
though individuals couldn't invest in actual bullion until 2005. Even then, the opening was limited.
Today, however, some of the new products emerging in China and elsewhere can be traded over the Internet
like stocks.
The Shanghai Futures Exchange has warned that the product is primarily meant for big trading firms or gold
consumers and producers, such as the nation's expanding gold-mining and electronics industries. Yuan
Lianbo, who heads the gold-trading desk at Shandong Gold Group, one of the country's biggest gold miners,
said his company has already started trading the Shanghai futures contract to hedge its price risks.
Just before trading began, the exchange tried to limit speculation by individuals by more than tripling the size
of a single futures contract to one kilogram of gold from 300 grams. It also increased the amount of margin,
or collateral, that investors must post, to 9% from 7% of the value of the contract.
Still, while those moves lifted the minimum investment to about $2,700, analysts say gold futures are still
affordable to many Chinese investors.
Among those clients signing up to trade the gold contract through brokerage China International Futures Co.,
"about 90% are individual investors, most of whom were moving assets from stocks after turning bearish on
the stock markets," said Lei Hongjun, deputy manager of the firm's Ningbo branch. China's stock market shot
up 97% in 2007, but recently has tumbled 13% from its peak hit in October.
Of course, the new ability to trade gold in China won't automatically result in higher prices, analysts say. But
the new contract's movement will give the rest of the world a better idea of China's appetite for gold, which
will be a key factor for gold prices.
Since 2003, Western investors have poured billions of dollars into a related investment, the gold
exchange-traded fund. Gold ETFs are pegged to the price of gold, but trade like stocks.
The most active gold ETF, a Big Board-listed fund called streetTracks Gold Shares, now holds more of the
precious metal than the European Central Bank or China's central bank. (ETF shares typically represent a
chunk of physical gold.)
Similar funds have been launched in Australia, the United Kingdom, the U.S., South Africa, Mexico,
Singapore and various European countries.
Gold, often in the form of jewelry, holds a special place in many Asian and Middle Eastern investors'
portfolios. Increased wealth in these regions means more people can afford to buy on impulse.
Chinese officials have suggested their country's growing demand for commodities is a reason that its three
commodity-futures exchanges should play a greater role in global pricing. Sun Zhaoxue, chairman of China
Gold Association, was quoted on the Shanghai Futures Exchange's Web site as saying the new gold
contract will "improve China's influence on the global metals market and pave the way for China to set the
prices in the market."
Already, a copper-cathode contract traded at the Shanghai Futures Exchange since 1999 rivals the
importance of the main copper benchmark on the 130-year-old London Metal Exchange. However,
commodity benchmarks are tough to create from scratch, when most global investors have the option of
using the heavily traded New York and London commodity markets.

World Rides to Wall Street's Rescue --- Broad Market Still Worried; Dow Falls 2%

The market's message: The worst isn't over.
Fears about the resilience of U.S. consumers and worries about Citigroup Inc.'s mounting losses sent stocks
sharply lower yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 277.04, or 2.17%, to 12501.11. It's now
down 5.8% this year. All 30 of its component stocks were down yesterday, led by Citigroup, which tumbled
7.3%. Chip maker Intel Corp., which reported disappointing results after the close, seems likely to open
sharply lower today.
Investors overall were flocking to safe havens as a new wave of risk-aversion swept through the market. U.S.
Treasury securities and the Japanese yen -- both barometers of risk-taking sentiment -- rose sharply. In late
New York trading, the dollar was changing hands at 106.83 yen, down 1.3% from the day before and around
its lowest level against the yen since June 2005. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes dropped to 3.701%, the
lowest level in nearly four years.
Tuesday's selloff demonstrates that the housing turmoil and credit woes have morphed into a threat to the
broader economy. Banks such as Citigroup have absorbed many of the losses previously lurking off their
balance sheets and shown that they can attract billions of dollars in fresh investment from Asia and the
Middle East, but that isn't enough to reassure markets.
Disappointing data on unemployment and manufacturing point to increasing odds of a U.S. recession.
Yesterday, retail-sales data added to the gloom, with December sales falling 0.4% over the previous month,
worse than economists expected. For all of 2007, retail sales rose 4.2%, the softest annual gain in five years.
When credit markets first shuddered last summer, many investors saw the problem as one mainly affecting
the liquidity of financial institutions. The Dow even set a record high in early October, and banks tried to put
their troubles behind them by recording big write-downs in the third quarter of 2007. But the third-quarter
problem soon extended to the fourth quarter, and it now appears likely to last well into this year.
Many parts of the economy -- including retailers and tech companies -- are feeling the pain. Electronics
retailer Best Buy Co. said last week that its U.S. same-store sales rose just 0.3% in the five weeks ending
Jan. 5., while rival Circuit City Stores Inc. saw same-store sales fall 11% in December.
"The real economy will ultimately tell the story," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS
Greenwich Capital. "The U.S. consumer has been a bulwark against riskier times, and if the consumer is
turning over, that has massive repercussions."
The economy has proved surprisingly resilient in recent years to shocks including 9/11, and it might still
muddle through with slower growth rather than tipping into recession. That would be good news for stocks.
Even amid investors' disappointment yesterday about Intel, which reported strong earnings but not enough to
meet expectations, Stacy Smith, the company's chief financial officer, said it hasn't experienced any
significant weakening of its business.
Still, worries about a possible U.S. recession rippled across the globe. Markets in Japan, Hong Kong, China,
India, and Korea all fell Tuesday. In Europe, the FTSE 100 tumbled 3.1%, its largest percentage decline since
last August.
In another sign that investors are concerned about repercussions of slower U.S. growth, crude oil futures on
the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $2.30 to $91.90 a barrel. A recession could mean reduced demand
for energy.
Doug Cliggott, chief investment officer at Dover Management, a Connecticut investment firm, said the
government-linked investors pouring money into U.S. financial institutions have to put their big dollar holdings

--- Page 46 ---
Page 46 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
to work someplace. These white-knight investments are one way to do that, but not necessarily a sign that
markets are hitting bottom, he said.
"I'd be paying a lot more attention if it was Warren Buffett pouring all of his money into these firms," he said.
Yesterday's selloff, which erased all of the gains from a rally Monday, extended the stock market's dismal run
recently. The S&P 500 index is now down 6% this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 8.8%. And the
Russell 2000, which tracks small stocks, is down 18.5% from its July peak -- close to the 20% fall that marks
the traditional definition of a bear market.
"You do see some good values out there in the market," said Kim Caughey, senior investment analyst at Fort
Pitt Capital Group, a Pittsburgh portfolio-management firm. "But then you think, ugh, I don't know what's
going to happen to the economy."
Other markets signaled that investors' appetite for risk is flagging. The yen has become a proxy for investors'
willingness to take chances with their money. If investors get worried, the yen often strengthens.
The yen's unique role is tied to Japan's remarkably low interest rates. In a maneuver known as a "carry
trade," risk-taking investors are enticed to borrow cheaply in yen, then invest the borrowed money in other
countries where returns can be higher. When investors get risk-averse, they tend to undo these bets and pay
back their yen borrowing, making it stronger.
The yen "now is totally being driven by notions of risk aversion," said Jerome Abernathy, chief investment
officer of Stonebrook Capital Management, a New York currency manager. He says he doesn't expect to
re-enter carry trades until stock markets stabilize somewhat.
That could happen if the Federal Reserve delivers a much-anticipated interest-rate cut of a half percentage
point or even three-quarters of a percentage point when its policy-making committee meets at the end of this
month. Such a move "is like using a defibrillator on the market," said Mr. Abernathy. "You'll get a pulse back
for a while."
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated last week that he had the defibrillator ready when he said the Fed
could take "substantive" new actions to provide insurance against a recession.
Gold prices slipped yesterday, but remained around $900 an ounce, a sign of investors' desire for alternative
assets that are seen as stable.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Volatility Index -- the market's so-called "fear" gauge -- jumped 2%
to a reading of 23.34. The index uses listed derivatives prices to gauge investors' expectations of big
stock-market swings.
Despite today's jump, the index remains well below the levels the index hit in mid-August, when fears about
subprime mortgages led to a meltdown of some credit markets.
"It's clear to me that this market is still in a downtrend," said Steve Wolf, managing director at
asset-management firm Source Capital Group in Westport, Conn. "Things are bad today, but you would
expect to see more gripping fear," if the selling were about to run its course, he said.

Oil Hits a Three-Week Low --- Weak Retail Sales Lead to Concerns Of Slowing Demand

Oil Hits a Three-Week Low --- Weak Retail Sales Lead to Concerns Of Slowing Demand

Crude-oil prices slumped to a three-week low yesterday after U.S. retail sales came in weaker than expected,
sparking more concern about slowing oil demand.
The poor sales figures exacerbated worries that the U.S., the world's biggest energy consumer, is headed for
recession, and led to the seventh fall in oil prices in the nine sessions since Jan. 2, when prices first touched
$100 a barrel.
Light, sweet crude for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $2.30, or 2.4%, to $91.90
a barrel, the lowest settlement for a front-month contract since Dec. 20. Prices hit an intraday record $100.09
a barrel Jan. 3.
December retail sales fell by 0.4%, said the Commerce Department, which also released downward revisions
to sales figures from October and November. The December figures compared with expectations of a 0.1%
drop, according to a Dow Jones Newswires survey of analysts. The results suggest the housing slump and
higher energy prices caught up with consumers during the critical holiday shopping season.
The oil market's reaction yesterday to weak economic data represented a shift from its behavior in late 2007,
when traders would often bid crude higher on the increased chance of further U.S. rate cuts, which weaken
the dollar and are also seen as positive for crude demand.
"The retail sales data spells more bad news for the economy and is outweighing the weaker dollar" and
chances of further interest-rate cuts, said Tom Bentz, an analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New
York.
Also yesterday, President Bush, who is visiting Riyadh, told reporters that he hopes "OPEC nations put more
supply on the market" and warned of high energy prices damaging consuming economies. The statements
were made before a meeting with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah.
Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, responded by saying the kingdom, which is the world's biggest oil
exporter and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' de facto leader, would raise production
when the market justifies it.
While this represents no change in OPEC's usual line, the cartel is due to meet Feb. 1 in Vienna, and Bush's
three-day visit to Saudi Arabia could put pressure on the kingdom.
"Bush's public call for more OPEC oil raised the possibility of increased supply," said Tim Evans, an analyst
at Citigroup in New York.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices settled weaker as profit-taking weighed on prices after a recent rally on safe-haven buying as
investors seek a stable investment in times of economic uncertainty. January gold on the Comex division of
Nymex fell 60 cents to $901 an ounce.
COPPER: Bearish economic data pressured futures, as did profit taking and weaker crude-oil prices. Nearby
January Comex copper fell 9.7 cents per pound to $3.22.

Gold, Breaking $900, Benefits From Tension

Gold, Breaking $900, Benefits From Tension

New York gold futures hit record highs in a market expecting further Federal Reserve rate cuts that may
mean more dollar weakness. It was the metal's first settlement above $900 and was underpinned by inflation
fears and global tensions, analysts said.
Nearby January gold gained $5.50 to $901.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile
Exchange, rising as high as $907.30, a spot-month record. Most-active February gold rose $5.70 to $903.40,
hitting a contract high of $915.90.
"There is dollar weakness and follow-through buying in gold, with a technical-chart breakout," said John
Person, president of NationalFutures.com. "There are fears of a recession and economic meltdown as the
Fed lowers interest rates, which is perceived to devalue the dollar even further and is causing investors to
flee to the precious-metals arena."
The euro rose to $1.4871. Investors often buy gold as a hedge against dollar weakness and inflation as it is
seen as a haven that retains value.
Charles Nedoss, metals analyst with Peak Trading Group, also cited stronger crude oil and the escalation in
U.S.-Iran tensions as supportive influences.
New York gold futures began rising during the overnight trade as speculators -- such as hedge funds and
exchange-traded funds -- based overseas started buying, said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital
Markets Global Futures. "Risk-averse investors jumped on the bandwagon as $900 resistance was
surpassed," he said.
Analysts last month called for gold to test $900, but it broke above this "a lot faster" than many expected, Mr.
Nedoss said. Now, he said, many traders look for gold to next target $950, then $1,000. However, Mr.
Person anticipates gold first could run into some profit-taking pressure around $920 to $940.
Much may hinge on how a heavy slate of U.S. economic data during the rest of the week influences the
dollar, observers said. The main reports include retail sales, industrial production, housing starts and
inflation at the wholesale and consumer levels.
"I don't think it will be a single one [dictating gold direction], but the combination of everything will have a
snowball effect on the outlook for what is going on in the U.S. economy," said Carlos Sanchez,
precious-metals analyst with CPM Group.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures made their first gain in four sessions as frigid temperatures were anticipated in the
Northeast, the dollar weakened and tensions rose in Nigeria and Iran. Light, sweet crude for February
delivery settled $1.51, or 1.6%, higher at $94.20 a barrel on the NYME.
CORN: Prices rose sharply, adding to gains established Friday. March Chicago Board of Trade corn rose
18.75 cents to $5.3475 a bushel.

Greater Chances of Rate Cut Aid Stocks, Gold, Hurt Dollar

Greater Chances of Rate Cut Aid Stocks, Gold, Hurt Dollar

Investors saw increasing chances of steep interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and pushed stocks
higher, the dollar lower, and gold to a record of more than $900 an ounce.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 171.85 points, or 1.4%, at 12778.15. It is still down 3.7% on the
year. The strongest component was International Business Machines, which rallied 5.4% after issuing
preliminary fourth-quarter results that trounced analysts' expectations.
IBM benefited from the dollar's weakness in late 2007. The soft currency meant its substantial overseas
revenues translated into more dollars when booked back home.
The dollar weakened further against major foreign currencies, spurred along by last week's comments by Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said "substantive" interest-rate actions could be coming. Traders interpreted
that as a harbinger of a steep interest-rate cut at the Fed's Jan. 29-30 meeting, which would spur U.S.
economic growth.
"Now would be the time to cut early, because there are so many concerns, so many people wondering about
the risks from [bad mortgage bets at] the banks and whether the Fed has gotten things wrong so far," said
currency strategist Ashraf Laidi, of CMC Markets, a New York brokerage.
The Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate stands at 4.25%. Prices for 10-year Treasury notes rose
yesterday, pushing the yield down to 3.793%.
Futures traders in Chicago placed the chance of a half percentage-point rate cut, rather than the quarter-point
move favored by the Fed at previous meetings, at 56% yesterday. Gold, a traditional haven for investors at
times of economic uncertainty and to some an inflation hedge, ended $5.50 higher, up 0.6%, at a record
$901.60 an ounce in New York, up 8% this year.
The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.6%, or 38.36 points, at 2478.30, down 6.6% on the year. The
Standard & Poor's 500 was up 1.1%, or 15.23 points, to 1416.25, down 3.5% on the year.

Politics & Economics: Davos Event to Reflect Shift in Power
Politics & Economics: Davos Event to Reflect Shift in Power

When the elite of global business gather in Davos, Switzerland, for their annual retreat next week, the mood
will be dramatically darker than just a year ago.
Since the World Economic Forum last met in Davos, fallout from the global credit crunch has transformed the
outlook for the U.S. and global economies for the worse. Power and wealth have shifted from West to East,
from major oil companies to petro-governments, and from U.S. banks and hedge funds to the state-controlled
investment funds of the Middle East and Asia.
The turnaround promises to create a whole new A-list of stars this year in Davos, including once obscure
sovereign-wealth-fund managers, formerly boring central bankers and previously ignored bearish economists.
"There is a sea change going through business," said Nigel Doughty, chairman of British private-equity firm
Doughty Hanson & Co. and a Davos veteran. "The whole landscape has changed, not least because of the
decline in influence of Western nation states."
Few saw it coming. When Citigroup Inc.'s then chief executive officer, Charles Prince, predicted a "benign"
year for the global economy and financial markets last January in Davos, he was in good company. U.S. and
European bankers, industry chiefs and political leaders bubbled with confidence as they clinked glasses in
the tony ski resort.
Mr. Prince lost his job in the fallout from the subprime-lending crisis that hit in the summer. Citigroup needed
a $7.5 billion cash infusion from a Middle Eastern sovereign-wealth fund. Other household names of banking
are also looking to the East for cash, leaving Western governments to worry about the political implications.
Western stock markets have turned jittery. The price of oil has risen by half, gold has soared, and the dollar
has slumped as investors run for safety.
This year's Davos gathering will search for answers to a new set of far more gloomy questions, such as: Will
the U.S. economic downturn become a full-blown recession? Will Europe follow? Can Asia and other
emerging regions go on booming if exports to Western markets stall?
Mr. Prince won't be back to give his view this year, while some returning financial stars may be keeping their
heads down. Some CEOs from firms that sustained losses have been unwilling to join the discussion panels
on the credit crisis, according to people familiar with the process.
"I doubt we'll be the stars of the show this year, which I think is appropriate and healthy. I'd like to go back to
the obscurity we richly deserve," said Glenn Hutchins, a founder and co-chief executive of private-equity firm
Silver Lake, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and New York. "Everyone who wanted to talk about private equity
last year will want to talk about sovereign-wealth funds this year."
Central bankers, including the European Central Bank's Jean-Claude Trichet and the U.S. Federal Reserve's
Ben Bernanke, are also likely to get a more careful hearing this year, as panels discuss how to rework the
global financial system's rules and plumbing to avoid a repeat of the contagion from defaults on subprime
mortgages in the U.S.
Mr. Trichet is likely to remind regulation-wary Davos financiers of what he believes are the credit crisis's
lessons. Among them: the need to reduce markets' reliance on credit-rating firms and a need for scrutiny of
the bank-affiliated funds that played a central role in the subprime turmoil.
The most important debate in Davos will be about "the appropriate monetary and fiscal policies to get us out
of this mess." said Nouriel Roubini, a New York University economics professor and chairman of research
firm Roubini Global Economics. Mr. Roubini recalls becoming the butt of jokes at Davos last year because of
his bearish views on the economy.

--- Page 55 ---
Page 55 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
One Wall Street boss who can walk tall in Davos is Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., whose traders got the firm out of the subprime quicksand just in time. He is due to speak on a
panel with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on the need for a new concert of powers to secure
global stability.
Doughty Hanson's Mr. Doughty, however, plans to spend time in Davos seeking out "the people from those
parts of the world that are really experiencing dramatic growth, where there may be an opportunity for
products and services we could provide them with," he said. Those include emerging economies such as
China, Russia and Brazil, as well as Middle East oil producers.
One sign of rising interest in the Middle East beyond oil: A high-powered group of executives, including Cisco
Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers and Daniel Vasella, chairman of Swiss pharmaceutical group
Novartis AG, are attending an international conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, en route to Davos. Some will
miss the Swiss meeting's first day as a result.
Delegates from the Middle East, China, India and other rising regions will convey a message of strength at
the Swiss resort, many regular participants believe. The growing trade and investment linkages among the
emerging economies are bolstering confidence that those countries can continue to grow despite the
downturn taking hold in the U.S. and Europe. That in turn could help to limit the depth of the downturn in
developed economies.
This "decoupling" is likely to be a big topic at Davos. Skeptics say the idea that emerging markets no longer
depend on exporting goods to industrialized economies for growth could prove to be the next big illusion.
"Asia doesn't have enough domestic demand to compensate for a recession in the U.S.," said Stephen
Roach, Asia chairman at Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Roach's indefatigable warnings about U.S. credit and property bubbles bursting made him a marginal
voice amid the overconfidence of Davos meetings in recent years. But with the odds of a U.S. recession
rising, he and other bears who called 2007 right could get a wide hearing this year.

High-End Cards Fall From Grace --- Rising Delinquencies on Charges Lead Banks To Curb Generous Terms as Profits Look Shaky
High-End Cards Fall From Grace --- Rising Delinquencies on Charges Lead Banks To Curb Generous
Terms as Profits Look Shaky

The luster on all those silver, gold and platinum credit cards is getting tarnished.
For the past few years, banks that issue credit cards have aggressively wooed affluent customers with lavish
perks and fat credit lines. Now, that high-end strategy is coming back to bite the banks: There are growing
signs that some of those consumers are having a hard time paying their bills.
It is the latest in a series of woes for U.S. financial institutions, which are struggling to contain a series of
credit-related problems after years of strong profits. Banks have lost billions of dollars from soured home
loans and mortgage-related investments. And defaults on commercial and industrial loans could rise later this
year if the economy weakens further.
Investors and analysts will get an in-depth look at the credit-card problem this week when Citigroup Inc. and
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. -- two of the biggest U.S. issuers of plastic -- report fourth-quarter results. Both are
expected to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars to cover mounting losses on credit cards and other
consumer loans.
Bank of America Corp., which bought card company MBNA Corp. a few years ago, is scheduled to report
results next week.
Bank profits have been pumped up in recent years by historically low levels in credit-card delinquencies and
write-offs. Those levels had widely been expected to rise with the economic slowdown. The concerns
intensified Thursday, when American Express Co. said it had experienced a sudden and broad-based rise in
delinquencies in December.
Although Capital One Financial Corp. had also warned about growing problem loans, the AmEx development
was viewed as even worse news for the industry because AmEx is well-regarded widely for its creditworthy
customer base and sophisticated risk-management capabilities.
"This isn't an AmEx issue, it's an industry issue. We have started to see a spillover from the mortgage market
and the weaker economy into credit cards," said Christopher Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in
Baltimore.
A slowdown in overall credit-card growth during the past few years sent banks chasing high-end customers.
The upscale cards -- which offer amenities such as concierge services and access to popular events -- pump
up profits in good times because they carry higher fees for customers as well as merchants who pay banks a
percentage on each transaction.
In recent months, banks have scaled back some of their promotional offers on less-attractive customers. For
example, they reined in 0% balance-transfer gimmicks by adding on fees and shortening the time frame
associated with them.
At the same time, however, they are flooding the mailboxes of their best clients with offers for higher credit
lines and lower interest rates.
They are going after good customers such as Megan Bramlette (who is, coincidentally, a credit-card
consultant), who says she received two letters from Bank of America reminding her that she hasn't been
using her Chicago Cubs credit card -- and then raised her credit line 20%. "It's an aggressive strategy for a
dormant card," said Ms. Bramlette, who works for Auriemma Consulting Group and recently moved to London
from New York.

--- Page 57 ---
Page 57 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Industry analysts say card issuers are likely to start scaling back these types of offers. Banks have more
flexibility to reduce credit lines to troubled credit-card borrowers, and to take other actions, than they do with
mortgage customers who are locked into their loans.
Still, the rising delinquencies and charge-offs are likely to crimp bank profits at a time when they are under
pressure. Card losses at Bank of America are expected to rise to 6% in 2008 from 4.9% in the third quarter,
representing more than $500 million in incremental losses, or 12 cents a share, according to a report issued
Friday by Goldman Sachs banking analyst Lori Appelbaum.
The bank reports fourth-quarter results Jan. 22.
For Citigroup, which reports results tomorrow, the card business will take a back seat to mortgage-related
write-downs. The bank previously said it was expecting to see write-downs of $8 billion to $11 billion, but
analysts now expect that number to be far higher.
Citigroup is seeking additional capital from investors and is likely to soon announce big layoffs.
The credit-card business may attract more attention at J.P. Morgan, which has less exposure to the
mortgage-related securities problems than some other firms. Investors will be paying close attention to the
firm's investment-banking results. J.P. Morgan reports results on Wednesday.
The banks could find themselves under more pressure in their credit-card businesses later this year,
especially if December's unexpected rise in unemployment is the start of a trend. The Labor Department said
this month that the December unemployment rate jumped to 5% from 4.7%.
"The higher the unemployment rate goes, the more areas of potential loan losses come to the banks," said
John Augustine, chief investment strategist in Fifth Third Bancorp's private bank. He says it could take six
months for rising joblessness to sting banks with higher defaults, meaning that the coming earnings
announcements likely won't reflect the economy's true condition.

Markets and the Dollar

High-profile foreign investments in U.S. financial institutions have been making headlines recently. But those
capital injections are a trickle when compared to the outward flood of dollars from U.S. companies seeking to
increase assets and earnings in some currency other than the sinking dollar.
To fight financial market turbulence and a slowing economy, the Fed has injected extra liquidity, cut the
discount rate, and cut the fed funds rate a full percent. As it prepares to hit the rate-cut panic button harder,
the Fed should also try using its most powerful tool, a stronger dollar, to draw liquidity into credit markets,
reduce oil prices, and restart economic growth.
At 4.25%, the fed funds rate is now below both the 4.3% consumer price inflation rate and the 4.9%
third-quarter real growth rate. That's a more proactive interest rate stance than any previous pre-recession
environment. The Fed is trying to make the best of a bad monetary situation. Most of the damage was done
once the fed-funds rate was forced down to 1% in 2003 and held artificially low as the value of the dollar
evaporated and housing bubbled through 2005.
The Fed's late-December policy innovation -- auctioning funds through the discount window -- will gradually
shift as much as 7% of the Fed's $900 billion in assets from Treasury bills to collateralized bank loans. This is
constructive medicine. It should help deposit-taking banks finance mortgages, and also leave sought-after
Treasury bills in the market.
While some worry that central banks are losing their power due to the size and complexity of global markets,
the more likely problem is too much power. Central banks cause wide swings in interest rates and the value
of their currencies. With a delay, the swings penetrate the price level as inflation and deflation. Central banks
are the only institutions that have a literally unlimited balance sheet -- in the case of the Fed, the ability to
instantaneously create and inject into the economy as many billions of dollars as it determines useful (by
buying Treasury bills or acquiring temporary control of mortgage-related securities).
The elephant in the living room -- the topic Washington won't broach -- is the dollar itself as a powerful but
unused monetary policy tool. The Fed didn't mention the dollar in its Dec. 11 rate-decision communique, nor
in its November economic forecasts. In his recent 500-page memoir, and his Dec. 12 opinion piece on this
page, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan barely mentions the wide swings in the value of the dollar --
probably the most important economic and investing variable in the last decade -- and their causal connection
to first deflation and now inflation.
President Bush showed no embarrassment over dollar weakness in a November interview with Fox Business
News. He was asked: "Even if the economy is weak, shouldn't the dollar be strong?" Rather than a simple
"yes," the president said: "All I can tell you is the policy of this government is a strong dollar. We believe the
marketplace is the best place to set the exchange rates." Pressed if he was satisfied with where the
exchange rates are now, he replied: "Well, I am satisfied with the fact that we have a strong-dollar policy and
know that the market ought to be setting the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies."
Current U.S. dollar policy leaves only "the market" responsible for the dollar's collapse. Not known for deep
thinking, the currency markets tend to sell currencies issued by countries which make markets responsible for
currency values. The euro found this out the hard way in 2000 when Wim Duisenberg, then head of the
European Central Bank, invited markets to set the value of the euro based on Europe's economic
fundamentals. Look out below. The free fall didn't stop until Jean-Claude Trichet took over and installed
policies to preserve the euro's value regardless of the market's view of economic fundamentals.
There's no reason to think markets set currency values based on economic fundamentals anyway. In the
early 1990s, Japan's yen was super-strong through 1995 even though it pushed Japan into a decade-long
deflation spiral. Currency markets are famous for going to extremes, distorting economies and people's lives
without any qualm of conscience or reference to value.

--- Page 59 ---
Page 59 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
One of the Fed's main explanations for its hope that inflation could moderate despite dollar weakness -- the
same explanation it used in the late 1990s for claiming that dollar strength wouldn't cause deflation -- is its
research showing that the "trade-weighted" value of the dollar is not well-correlated to U.S. inflation. The
obvious problem with this approach is that the trade-weighted dollar mixes together changes in the dollar's
value with changes in the value of foreign currencies.
The dollar's trade-weighted value can be down due to foreign currency appreciation, and vice versa, with little
impact on U.S. inflation. In contrast, the connection between gold-measured changes in the value of the
dollar and the U.S. inflation rate is too clear to keep ignoring.
The relationship between currency values and inflation or deflation is equally strong in other countries. China
is suffering high inflation now because the gold-measured value of the yuan is weak (even though the
trade-weighted yuan is strong due to dollar and yen weakness). Yen strength in the late 1980s and early '90s
drove Japan into a deflation spiral, the same process that struck the U.S. in the late '90s.
By saying they want a stronger dollar, the Fed, the president or the Treasury could make it happen.
Government policy makers have almost absolute control over perceptions of the future scarcity of dollars.
This controls the demand for dollars almost as much as it does the supply, setting its value as much or more
than rates do.
But world markets expect a dovish Fed now and in the future. This is driving capital away from the dollar.
Washington can easily change this perception by linking a stronger dollar to its much-needed fight against
inflation. Coordinated currency interventions are a helpful and decisive signal of a monetary policy change,
but aren't required. The necessary policy change is a top-down U.S. policy decision in favor of a stronger,
more stable dollar as a core U.S. growth policy.
As a next step in addressing financial-market turbulence, the Fed and the administration should say they
want the dollar to strengthen in order to attract capital, spur U.S. growth and slow the inflation rate. There's
still time. Jobless claims are not yet at recession levels, stock prices are high, and exports are booming. The
weak dollar doesn't seem to be at a tipping point -- it's more of a constant drag on the economy, like
American litigiousness and the anti-growth tax code.
But the harder the economy works to repair the weak-dollar damage from the bottomless liquidity punch bowl
of 2004, the deeper the urge for the "hair of the dog" medicine of more rate cuts. Those may weaken the
dollar more, adding to inflation. The clear alternative is to strengthen the dollar first.

Grains Rally, Gold Ends Near $900

Grains Rally, Gold Ends Near $900

Bullish crop reports issued Friday by the Agriculture Department reverberated from grains markets into other
commodities as the high prices sparked concerns about growing inflationary pressures, analysts said.
U.S. grain and soybean futures directly affected by the reports rallied on smaller-than-expected estimates for
corn supplies and total winter wheat plantings.
Gold and cotton futures, meanwhile, felt spillover support amid concerns about rising inflation and limited
acreage, analysts said. Gold crept toward $900 an ounce, settling less than $4 below it. Livestock futures fell
as costs to feed animals will be even higher in coming months.
Chicago Board of Trade corn futures hit fresh 12-year highs during the session. Nearby March futures rose
20 cents a bushel, which is the exchange-imposed daily allowable trading limit, settling at $4.95. Support
stemmed from ideas that a drop in corn supplies will require the market to secure millions more acres for
2008 plantings, analysts said.
The corn market will have to battle soybeans and wheat for the acres, as all the markets are vying for
increased area to increase production and loosen up tight supplies. U.S. wheat futures rallied to record highs
in 2007 on historically low supplies, and wheat-industry members were hoping the USDA's seeding report
would reveal strong gains in planted acreage. Nearby March wheat rose 26.75 cents a bushel to $9.0925.
CBOT November soybeans, which represent the next crop to be planted, closed up the daily
exchange-imposed price limit.
"People are scared to death now that the tug of war between beans and corn is going to persist through
November 2008 and maybe in the 2009 crop," said Peter Meyer, senior vice president for Lehman Brothers.
Prices for cotton soared as traders grappled with the USDA's larger-than-expected estimate for one class of
wheat, soft red winter wheat. Both crops are planted in the Southeast and Delta.
In the gold market, nearby-month January gold rose $4.40 an ounce to $896.10 on the Comex division of the
New York MercantileExchange. It was up $33, or 3.8%, on the week. The active February contract traded as
high as $900.10 an ounce, settling at $897.70.
The rally came amid ideas that the agricultural surge will contribute to inflationary pressure, said Dan Vaught,
analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons. The impact of the grains rally on gold was impressive given that the dollar
was firmer and energies lower, analysts said.
Oil futures slid to their lowest close in three weeks on Nymex, falling $1.02, or 1.1%, to $92.69 a barrel.
Futures lost 5.3% on the week, snapping a string of four weekly advances.

A Private Fix for Countrywide
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
A Private Fix for Countrywide

For some observers, the first good thing to emerge from Bank of America's intention to buy Countrywide
Financial is that they probably won't have Angelo Mozilo to kick around anymore. The Countrywide chief
executive's future with the new entity hasn't been announced, but with his retirement already scheduled for
next year, the odds are that Mr. Mozilo eventually will take the severance gold and head for the sun.
The more substantial good news in this announcement is that it's another significant sign that private capital
markets are starting to do what is necessary to rationalize the subprime mortgage mess. As well, it may
signal the Bernanke Fed that it doesn't have to rescue the economy all on its lonesome because the main
players on this field have disappeared into the tall weeds.
Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide is a $4 billion all-stock transaction. That is, private capital is
assuming the responsibility, and need, to clean up its own problems. We think this is more in the long-term
interests of the markets than the recent trend of troubled banks such as Merrill Lynch, UBS, Morgan Stanley
and Citigroup finding capital infusions from investment funds controlled by foreign governments, with Citi and
Merrill rumored to be seeking more of the same. To be sure their capital needs are large to shore up
damaged balance sheets. But BofA's $4 billion Countrywide deal shows that private markets can commit
capital to this problem and in a way that puts needed space between taxpayers and bailouts.
BofA had already invested $2 billion in Countrywide in August. Still, Countrywide was tottering toward
bankruptcy, which would have shifted much current market risk in the direction of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac. That surely would have caused fingers to twitch in Congress. The BofA infusion likely diminishes the
chances of that happening. As to Countrywide's shareholders who've been heading for a wipeout, it is true
they'll now hold paper in a first-rate financial institution. But they'll be getting a lot less for their shares than
they would have two months ago. And again, their "bailout" is private capital.
Bank of America admits it may not see light from this deal for several years. As of now, however, the market
is starting to function as it should.

AnnTaylor Falls 15%; Zep Rises
Small-Stock Focus

Small-capitalization stocks rose yesterday but the Russell 2000 index of small-cap shares remains down 6%
for the young year.
The Russell rose 8.09 points, or 1.14%, to 720.21. The Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 increased 3.09, or
0.84%, to 372.11; it is also down about 6% for the year.
While almost all small-cap sectors were up, materials companies helped lead the way, strengthened by
higher gold and commodities prices.
"Gold being up makes sense if we're going to have more interest-rate cuts," said Richard Campagna,
managing director for Provident Investment Counsel. He said Fed rate cuts will theoretically lead to a weaker
dollar and enable U.S. steel and materials companies to be more competitive through exports.
Among the small-cap materials companies that moved higher were Schnitzer Steel, up $1.95, or 3.4%, to
$58.68, and RTI International Metals, up 3.06, or 5.3%, to 60.87 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Another stalwart among materials companies was Zep Inc., which tacked on 1, or 7.4%, to 14.54 after the
Atlanta company reported higher first-quarter earnings and sales on favorable pricing.
Mr. Campagna doesn't think yesterday's strength will be the catalyst for a rally in the coming days. "This will
be a short-lived bounce because we're not really seeing a reduction in rates until the 30th, and even a
[half-percentage-point] cut doesn't get us to where we need to be," he said.
Declines in December same-store sales prompted earnings guidance cuts from both Men's Wearhouse, down
7.60, or 30%, to 17.84, and AnnTaylor Stores, off 3.65, or 15%, to 19.95, both on the NYSE.
The price of sweet crude oil, which opened lower and then remained well below recent highs, weighed on
some of the market. Several oil-related stocks were down at close, including Hornbeck Offshore Services,
down 1.94, or 4.4%, to 42.31, and Basic Energy Services, down 58 cents, or 2.8%, to 20.26, both on the
NYSE.
Reflecting continued subprime-related worries, Thornburg Mortgage (NYSE) declined 40 cents, or 4.6%, to
8.38, after the Santa Fe, N.M., single-family residential mortgage lender said continued pressure in the
mortgage market has cut the book value of its portfolio by about $200 million in two months.
E-House Holdings rose 3.63, or 15%, to 27.86, on the NYSE, after the Shanghai real-estate-services
company signed agreements to be the sales agent for several projects owned by three real-estate developers
in China.
Bar-and-grill operator Ruby Tuesday (NYSE) fell 1.03, or 14%, to 6.21, after the Maryville, Tenn., chain
reported it swung to a fiscal second-quarter net loss, cut its 2008 outlook and warned it could default on some
borrowing agreements in the next year.
Among the companies hurt by weak earnings reports or guidance was WD-40 Co., which slid 4.68, or 13%, to
31.66, after the San Diego petroleum-based lubricant maker posted fiscal first-quarter earnings below Wall
Street expectations.
In addition, Electronics for Imaging fell 5.95, or 31%, to 13.22. The Foster City, Calif., publishing hardware
and software company forecast fourth-quarter earnings below analysts' expectations, citing weak demand for
its high-margin Fiery products.

Ikon Office Solutions dropped 2.18, or 18%, to 10.01, on the NYSE, after the Malvern, Pa., office-products
and software company lowered its first-quarter earnings guidance on lower-than-anticipated equipment
revenue.
Synaptics dropped 5.72, or 15%, to 32.71, after American Technology Research cut its rating on the Santa
Clara, Calif., maker of touchpads for computers to neutral from buy, citing a loss in market share.
Noven Pharmaceuticals declined 42 cents, or 3%, to 13.37, after the Miami drug-delivery-systems developer
said it received a Food and Drug Administration warning letter concerning a patch used to treat ADHD.

Treasury-bond prices declined as stocks rallied following a report that Bank of America Corp. is in talks to
acquire Countrywide Financial Corp., cutting demand for the safety of government debt.
The two-year note, the most sensitive to changes in monetary policy, gave up gains made after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's downbeat remarks on growth, which raised expectations for
more-aggressive interest-rate cuts this year.
The 10-year and 30-year sectors, already under pressure on concerns the Fed's aggressive rate-cutting
stance will fuel inflation, slumped further as investors digested the Bank of America-Countrywide news.
Talk of the deal "gives some stability to the market, [and] some safe-haven flow was reduced," said Kurush
Mistry, an interest-rate strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
The benchmark 10-year note was 26/32 point lower, or $8.125 per $1,000 face value, at 102 30/32. Its yield,
which rises when prices fall, rose to 3.888% from 3.790% Wednesday. The 30-year bond fell 2 5/32 points to
yield 4.443%. Ten- and 30-year Treasurys were the biggest losers of the day as investors dumped them on
concern inflation will eat into their returns. Investors face crude oil at elevated levels, gold breaking records,
and a falling dollar that will fuel gains in import prices.
With Mr. Bernanke's focusing more on the risks to growth, "there are those who see this as the Fed in effect
raising the risk that inflation could rear its ugly head in the short term," said William O'Donnell, rates
strategist at UBS Securities. "The Fed's more aggressive tone has those in the back end of the curve feeling
a little bit blue," he said. "This is a party they're not going to be privy to."
Meanwhile, bond insurer MBIA Inc. is expected to sell $1 billion surplus notes today at the earliest or next
week, according to an investor familiar with the deal.
Success in selling the surplus notes is a vital component of MBIA's capital-raising strategy.

Oil, Gold Get Bernanke Boost --- Hope for Rate Cuts Helps to Ease Fears Undermining Crude

Crude-oil and gold futures got a boost after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled support for
more, possibly aggressive, interest-rate cuts to support economic growth.
But growing concerns of an imminent economic slowdown are continuing to push crude lower, while
recession fears may push gold the opposite direction, to new nominal highs.
After the Fed chief's remarks, light, sweet crude for February delivery reversed heavier losses earlier in the
day to close down $1.96, or 2%, at $93.71 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It had fallen as low as
$93.25 after more economists began warning of spreading economic woes. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
early yesterday that Japan is at risk of recession; that call came a day after other Goldman economists
warned the U.S. was slipping into recession.
Gold futures settled at a record on the Comex division of Nymex for the third session in a row. Nearby
January gold added $12.20 an ounce at $891.70.
The prospect of lower interest rates could push down the U.S. dollar further relative to other currencies, as
global investors move some money invested in U.S. debt abroad. Gold is seen as an alternative store of
value when the dollar is depreciating, and thus tends to rise when the Fed eases rates.
Mr. Bernanke's comments "inadvertently helped gold continue on its march to $900," said George Gero, vice
president with RBC Capital Markets.
Meanwhile, a recession "carries significant implications for the growth of oil demand," said Antoine Halff, an
energy research analyst with Newedge USA LLC, in an interview. The U.S. accounts for nearly 25% of the
world's oil demand, and analysts expect a U.S. slowdown will also have ripple effects across the world,
especially in China, the biggest exporter to the U.S. and a main contributor to the world's growing oil
consumption.
Mr. Bernanke said the economy would most likely avoid a recession this year but still undergo a period of
slow growth. He opened the door to large interest-rate reductions, noting that officials "stand ready to take
substantive additional action as needed to support growth."
The Fed chairman also pointed out the role of oil prices in inflation. Higher oil prices are "lifting overall
consumer prices and probably putting some upward pressure on core inflation measures as well," he said.
Daniel Flynn, an analyst with Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago, said crude prices could drop another $10 to
$12 in the near term before traders have the chance, closer to summer driving season when gasoline
demand increases, to see "if we take another leg up above $100 a barrel."
In other commodity markets:
COTTON: Futures declined sharply, pressured by speculative sales and bearish options trades. March cotton
on ICE Futures U.S. dropped 2.06 cents to 66.96 cents a pound.
RICE: Prices hit records on bullish weekly export shipments data from the Agriculture Department. Chicago
Board of Trade March rice increased by 10.50 cents to settle at $14.6050 per hundredweight.

Gold Climbs Yet Closer to $900 --- Safe-Haven Deals, Speculative Buying Power Latest Gains

Suddenly, $900-an-ounce gold isn't that far away.
Speculative purchases and safe-haven buying sent gold futures higher amid a general commodities rally as
the dollar weakened.
The benchmark, though lightly traded, nearby January gold contract rose $18.40, or 2.1%, to settle at $878
an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. During the session, the contract
peaked at $878.40, breaking the Comex nearby contract high of $875 set on Jan. 21, 1980.
Most-active February gold pushed even higher, rising $18.30, also more than 2%, to settle at $880.30 after
hitting a contract high of $884. Adjusted for inflation, however, the 1980 high would be nearly $2,200 an
ounce.
Gold futures are seeing "continued accumulation trade" with funds "continuing to go long," said Zachary
Oxman, senior trader with Wisdom Financial. Long positions are expectations prices will increase, and gold
has seen greater involvement by hedge funds, exchange-traded funds and other non-commercial users.
Support came as the U.S. dollar continued to weaken and commodities in general were rallying, Mr. Oxman
said.
"There is fund buying all of the way up," said Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset Management.
"Gold was up 30% last year. People are riding the winner."
Anticipation of a gold-futures offering in Asia and talk of a gold exchange-traded fund in the Middle East
have brought the funds, as well as institutional and retail investment, to the metal, said Jim Steel, senior vice
president and metals analyst with HSBC.
A rally in base metals and energy also supported gold, he said.
"Most of the metals are higher," said Andrew Montano, director of precious metals with Scotia Mocatta.
Maurice Cacciotti, director of operations with B&C Trading, attributed gold's rise mainly to crude oil's
"exploding" price.
But higher oil prices were just part of the reason gold climbed, said Neal Greenberg, trader with RBC
Proprietary Trading. Gold has been stronger lately, supported by oil, the dollar and geopolitical worries. But
the recent leg higher comes as market participants flee derivatives problems linked to subprime-mortgage
issues, housing woes and the credit crunch, he said.
"I think this is just a flight into safety," Mr. Greenberg said.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Futures ended higher for the first time in four sessions, supported by expectations that U.S.
inventory data will show crude-oil stockpiles fell for the eighth straight week. Light, sweet crude for February
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled $1.24, or 1.3%, higher at $96.33 a barrel. Prices rose
as high as $97.54 before sliding quickly in the last half-hour before settlement. A report that a big attack on a
Nigerian oil facility is being planned helped prices jump higher earlier in the session, as did the view that the
previous day's nearly $3 fall in prices wasn't justified.
COFFEE: Futures rose, supported by strength across commodities and buoyed by a lower-than-anticipated
crop estimate from Brazil. The ICE Futures U.S. March coffee contract closed 4.05 cents higher at $1.3545 a
pound.

Countrywide Financial shares were mauled in yesterday's 238.42-point market rout, while AT&T was
damaged by worries about mortgage markets and the state of the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average completed its worst five sessions to open a year since 1978.
Already wounded by the credit and housing crises, Countrywide Financial fell $2.17, or 28%, to $5.47, its
lowest close since July 1996. Research firm Egan-Jones Ratings said the lender urgently needed a capital
infusion or it might "falter." Countrywide said bankruptcy rumors had no substance.
The market was finding its feet when a discouraging statement from AT&T, heir to the Ma Bell franchise,
hastened another big drop in the afternoon. The company's chief executive said the telecommunications giant
was experiencing some slowdown in consumer units, the Associated Press reported. AT&T fell $1.87, or
4.6%, to $39.16.
Bond insurers were weak after Morgan Stanley stock analysts cut profit forecasts for Ambac Financial Group
and MBIA because of exposure to deteriorating credit markets. These companies guarantee risky debt and
stand to lose in the event of widespread defaults. Ambac fell 3.92, or 17%, to 19.56; MBIA plunged 3.64, or
21%, to 13.98.
Among brokers, Bear Stearns fell 5.08, or 6.7%, to 71.17 as the investment bank kept mum on a Wall Street
Journal report that James Cayne would step down as chief executive.
KB Home fell 1.70, or 9.2%, to 16.78 after the major house builder rocked investors a $9.99-a-share fourth
quarter loss because of sinking home prices and a tax charge. Among other large builders, Toll Brothers slid
79 cents, or 4.7%, to 16.04.
There were a few bright spots in the market: Newmont Mining rose 1.26, or 2.5%, to 52.78. Gold futures set
record highs in nominal terms, as hard assets continued to serve as a safe haven from financial, economic
and geopolitical risks. Miner NovaGold Resources added 46 cents, or 4.2%, to 11.36.
Similarly, oil futures whipsawed higher, sending airline stocks into a nosedive. American Airlines parent AMR
declined 1.55, or 12%, to 11.74; United Airlines parent UAL (Nasdaq) fell 4.79, or 16%, to 24.39.
The defensive health-care area continued to draw buyers: Shares of Amgen (Nasdaq) added 94 cents, or
2.1%, to 46.33 after the biotechnology concern said it expects 2007 earnings to come in at the low end of
prior projections, despite a turbulent year.
Eli Lilly rose 1.51, or 2.8%, to 56.06, after the Food and Drug Administration approved daily use of the
pharmacy giant's Cialis erectile-dysfunction drug.
King Pharmaceuticals rose 1.70, or 16%, to 12.08 after the drug maker granted future rights for a generic
version of a key muscle-relaxant product to a closely held rival, retaining exclusivity for some time.
Merck & Co. was the biggest percentage gainer among Dow components, adding $1.74, or 3%, to 59.66.
AT&T's discouraging news only added to the steady drumbeat of consumer-spending worries.
Bears took a bite out of Brinker International, which fell 2.18, or 12%, to 16.15, after the operator of Chili's,
Macaroni grill and other eateries forecast a decline in fiscal second-quarter same-store sales in eateries open
a year or more.
Starbucks (Nasdaq) rose 1.48, or 8.1%, to 19.86 on the Nasdaq after the coffee-shop chain said founder
Howard Schultz would resume direct control of the company as chief executive.

In the Shadows of India's Loan Boom --- Banks Now Face Regulation For Their Collection Tactics, Which Included Beatings
In the Shadows of India's Loan Boom --- Banks Now Face Regulation For Their Collection Tactics,
Which Included Beatings

Vinod Kumar was sitting in a friend's car listening to the radio one evening last January when a stranger
appeared, yanked him from the vehicle and beat him with an iron bar.
While the 21-year-old college student lay bleeding in the parking lot, the assailant sped off with the tiny silver
hatchback. But this was no ordinary mugging: Mr. Kumar's attacker was a goonda -- a thug -- working on
behalf of one of India's largest banks.
Incidents like the one that left Mr. Kumar with 12 stitches in his scalp and a 10-day hospital stay reflect a dark
side of India's economic boom. As consumer lending soars to record levels, India's banks face mounting
criticism and government sanctions for their aggressive loan recovery tactics, which sometimes include using
hired thugs. With the economy growing at more than 8.5% a year for the past four years, Indians are taking
on home, car and credit-card debt as never before -- with borrowing for the first time. Retail loans have
almost tripled over the past three years, according to the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, reaching $124 billion
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007.
The lending has helped drive a surge in consumption. But it has also created new headaches for Indian
banks, which have limited experience recovering loans from defaulting borrowers. Traditionally, most Indians
have avoided debt. Even now, only 30 million credit cards have been issued nationwide, an exceedingly small
number for a country with more than a billion people. As a result, banks haven't evolved standard procedures
for recouping bad debts.
In another recent case, an HDFC Bank manager and two recovery agents were charged with criminal
intimidation, extortion and "outraging the modesty" of a woman in Mumbai. The customer claimed to have
already paid back the loan, while his wife told the police the agents had "misbehaved" with her. The case has
yet to come to trial, and the manager still works for the bank. HDFC declined to comment.
Ruling on Mr. Kumar's case in November, the Delhi State Consumer Commission fined ICICI Bank, India's
largest privately owned bank by market value, almost $140,000 for what a judge called "the grossest kind of
deficiency in service and unfair trade practice." ICICI Bank has appealed the decision to the Delhi High Court,
arguing that the consumer court doesn't have the authority to impose such a large fine and that the collection
agency should be held responsible for the attack, not the bank. It has also fired the collection agency
responsible for the attack.
While India's overall percentage of nonperforming loans is low -- about 2.5% of all outstanding loans -- the
absolute number of bad retail loans is growing with increased lending. ICICI Bank, for example, currently
grants about 150,000 small-ticket loans (up to $1,270) each month. So, even a default rate of 2.5% means an
additional 3,750 bad loans.
ICICI Bank has been India's most aggressive bank in the retail market, using the Internet, phone banking and
automated teller machines to target the increasingly affluent middle class. As of March 31, 2007, retail loans
accounted for 65% of the bank's total amount of money the bank has lent.
But the change has come at a cost. The bank's gross nonperforming loans in the retail segment more than
doubled during the financial year ended March 31, 2007, rising from $364 million to $790 million, and
accounted for almost 74% of all its bad loans by value. And defaults are expected to keep rising, according to
a Fitch Ratings Ltd. report on Indian banks released last month.
The report cited rising interest rates as the major factor affecting borrowers ability to repay. "The glorious run
of an ever-improving gross NPL ratio that began in the late 1990s (when the ratio was more than 15%, before
falling to 2.5% in 2007) may just be over," the report says.

Loans are typically classified as nonperforming if a customer fails to make payments for 90 days. At that
point, banks are supposed to issue legal notices to those in default. But because it can take years to pursue a
debtor through India's turgid legal system, many banks hire outside collection agents.
"The [legal] system is not attuned to dealing with a large number of retail-banking cases where you need a
quick remedy," says Indian Banks' Association Chief Executive H.N. Sinor.
The collection agents are paid a basic fee plus a percentage of the amount recovered. Unlike in the U.S., the
bank retains ownership of the loan instead of transferring it to the collection agents.
That's where the trouble starts. Increasingly, critics say, loan recovery has involved the use of strong-arm
tactics by goondas, a Hindi term for gangsters who indulge in intimidation and violence to recover debts.
Mr. Kumar got a brutal taste of goondas methods. He was waiting in the parking lot of a cricket stadium in
New Delhi when he was confronted by a man saying he was from ICICI Bank and was looking for Tapan
Bose, whose last three car-loan repayment checks had bounced.
Mr. Kumar attempted to call Mr. Bose on his cellphone, but "before the phone rang once," he found himself
being dragged out of the car. He tried to resist but the man began to beat him. In the scuffle, Mr. Kumar's
gold chain was snatched from around his neck, and the next thing he remembers is being hit on the back of
his skull with an iron rod.
"I never thought anything like this would ever happen to me," Mr. Kumar says.
While allegations of strong-arm tactics aren't new in India -- collection agents working for Citibank faced
similar accusations in the 1990s -- the practice has grown more prevalent with the boom in retail lending.
Increasing violence associated with loan collections have spurred India's central bank to crack down.
In November, the RBI released draft guidelines for using collection agents. The guidelines warn banks that in
cases of persistent abusive practices, the RBI could impose a temporary or even a permanent ban on hiring
outside agents, who so far haven't been subject to regulation. The guidelines also call for a minimum of 100
hours training for recovery agents, as well as recommending the use of Lok Adalats, a sort of people's court
where disputes are solved by direct talk between litigants, to settle default cases.
The Indian Supreme Court has also weighed in on the matter, ruling that banks cannot engage goondas.
Since the thugs often have criminal records, banks are being told by the police to have their collection agents
vetted by them.
Meanwhile, New Delhi police have begun an ad campaign to urge citizens to report incidents of harassment,
and consumer groups are up in arms against the banks. "We are not for the rampant coercion of the people,"
says Dr. M.S. Kamath of the Consumer Guidance Society of India. "Coercion is not the way to recover loans."
On the defensive, banks have maintained they were unaware of, or not responsible for, the strong-arm tactics
of collection agents they hire. Still, some banks are rethinking how they make loans and collect debts. ICICI
Bank, for one, is re-evaluating its credit requirements for small-ticket personal-loans.
"The lower-income segment is very important to us and to Indian banks. It is important that they get credit so
that wealth cycles can be initiated" says V. Vaidyanathan, executive director at ICICI Bank. "However, we feel
credit norms need to be tightened to avoid overleveraging of the customer."

Forex View: Euro Expected to Advance Toward High Versus Dollar

Little relief is in sight for the beleaguered dollar.
Analysts expect the euro this week to advance toward its record high of $1.4968, struck Nov. 23. The dollar
likely will weaken against the yen, falling from the current 108-yen level to around 107 yen.
A whirlwind of disappointing U.S. economic data and record-breaking oil and gold prices has damped hopes
for the dollar's resurgence. An early-year rally had been widely expected by many currency analysts.
"The expected dollar rally is still a way off," said Jim McCormick, head of currency research at Lehman
Brothers in London. He pointed to the continued surge in commodity prices, slow growth, and inflation.
Investors seeking havens have instead channeled funds into the yen and euro.
"More people were talking in a lot more optimistic terms about the dollar," said Steve Barrow, chief currency
strategist for Bear Stearns in London. That "was based largely on the perception that the U.S. has a lot of bad
news priced in. The euro zone has stuff to come." But the dollar could instead have as many as four
tumultuous months, he said.
Mr. Barrow cited Friday's disappointing nonfarm-payrolls report, which suggested that the housing downturn
is still taking a toll, and expectations that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will keep
interest rates steady at meetings this week. Both announcements are due Thursday.
"The [Federal Reserve] is very possibly going to continue to ease, and very probably the ECB is going to
continue to do nothing," Mr. Barrow said. "If you want to be a dollar bull on the basis of the policy landscape
equaling out between Europe and the U.S., you still have a few months to wait."
Late Friday, the euro was at $1.4752 from $1.4750 late Thursday. The dollar was at 108.46 yen from 109.23
yen. The euro was at 160 yen from 161.11 yen. The British pound was at $1.9717 from $1.9736, and the
dollar was quoted at 1.1067 Swiss francs from 1.1110 francs.

Green Thumb: Sometimes, the Best Offense Is a Good Defense

For investors unnerved by the new year's stock swings -- including Friday's 256.54-point dive in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average -- the natural inclination may be to start piling into "defensive" investments.
That is easier said than done.
Amid the flight to safety in recent months, some traditional defensive moves, such as Treasury securities and
utility stocks, have already soared in price, making them less attractive. "A knee-jerk reaction is to say 'I'll
head to Treasurys,' but that's not the way you want to play defensively" right now, says Dennis Trittin, a
money manager at Russell Investments. "It all depends on what the valuations are in order to determine what
ultimately is conservative."
In general, it is unwise to make big changes in a portfolio based on short-term market wiggles. But if it's a
matter of scaling back on the aggressiveness of a portfolio, current market conditions are making it tougher to
pick haven investments.
One option may be adding high-quality municipal bonds or corporate bonds. At the same time, health-care
stocks are worth considering right now, because like utility companies, most health-care companies aren't
going to take a big hit in a slowing economy -- people still need things like electricity, water and medicine
whether or not the economy is strong. However, unlike utilities, health-care stocks haven't run up a lot lately.
For months now, Wall Street firms, banks and big institutional investors have been snapping up U.S.
government debt, driving prices higher and yields lower. The U.S. Treasury 10-year notes are yielding less
than 3.9%, while the U.S. Treasury two-year note is yielding just 2.7%.
The bottom line: Even though inflation remains low, it will basically eat up any income earned from
investments like these unless there are price gains.
In addition, there is evidence that the prices on Treasury securities are already at a level that assumes the
economy will slip into recession, a scenario that would result in lower interest rates -- and higher bond
prices, which move inversely to yields. For example, bond prices rallied during the early part of the week, but
on Friday posted only moderate gains despite the weaker-than-expected employment report.
On the other hand, municipal bonds are offering healthy yields. The typical 10-year triple-A-rated issue is
yielding about 3.57%. Its taxable equivalent yield for someone in top tax bracket, in a high-tax state like New
York, would be 5.5%.
The ratio of muni-bond yields to those offered by Treasurys is "still pretty attractive," says Ronald Perry, a
money manager at Western Asset Management. Of course, should there be a selloff in the Treasurys market,
muni bonds would still take a hit, "but it's going to be less of a problem if you were in the cheaper investment,"
he says.
Investment decisions in the stock market can get equally complicated. Stocks of utility companies, which are
traditionally considered safe bets in a slowing economy, have had a good run, with many gaining over 20% in
2007. But that means they are on the pricey side. The average utility stock in the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index finished last year trading at 18.4 times earnings and is changing hands at 16.4 times 2008
expected earnings. That is well above the average price-earnings ratio of 15 going back to 1995.
The average utility-oriented mutual fund is up 19% for the one year through Jan. 3, according to Morningstar
Inc.
An alternative might instead be health-care companies, which haven't risen as much in the past year as
utilities. "If you wanted to get a little bit more defensive," it's worth considering a health-sciences fund, says
Gregg Brewer of research firm Value Line Inc.

--- Page 78 ---
Page 78 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Two mutual-fund options, he says, are Vanguard Health Care fund and T. Rowe Price Health Sciences fund.
However, health-care funds are generally dominated by the big drug companies so while they won't be hurt
by a struggling economy, they could suffer if these companies continue to struggle to find new blockbuster
drugs.
Investors may also consider funds that invest primarily in stocks, but nevertheless tend to not move in tandem
with the overall market. For instance, two such funds are the Merger Fund and the Arbitrage Fund, both of
which try to bet on merger-and-acquisition activity.
"If you're looking for something that dances to its own drumbeat, these [funds] do that," Mr. Brewer says.
In 2007, investors made big money in non-U.S. stocks, largely because economies around the globe,
particularly emerging markets, were able to better weather the woes stemming from the U.S. real-estate
market. The average diversified emerging-market mutual fund is up 35% for the one-year period through Jan.
3, according to Morningstar.
Investor money has followed: Last year a record $32 billion was invested in mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds that primarily invest in emerging-market stocks, according to AMG Data Services.
Money managers say that while the best bargains among non-U.S. stocks are gone, investors shouldn't pull
the money back home. "Our managers believe this is not a flash-in-the-pan type of scenario," says Russell's
Mr. Trittin.
However, given that the non-U.S. markets aren't as cheap as they have been in the past, investors worried
that perhaps the U.S.'s woes could spread overseas should keep an eye on their overseas holdings. This
point was hammered home the past week as overseas markets posted bigger declines than the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.
Franklin Templeton's Conservative Target Fund, for example, is sticking with about a 2.3% position in the
firm's China World Fund, which was up 44% in 2007.
"What's important is that you have the proper allocation" when it comes to high-risk asset classes, says
Anthony Coffey, portfolio manager for the Franklin Templeton Fund Allocator Series. As the fund has posted
gains, he says, "we pare it back periodically," in order to plop those gains into another portion of the market
that looks promising.
Commodities, which investors often buy in order to diversify their portfolio, have also been hot lately, with the
price of both oil and gold touching records in recent weeks.
Tim Kochis, a fee-only planner in San Francisco, advises a 5% allocation to commodities over the long haul,
primarily because commodities prices tend not to move in tandem with stock prices, and therefore provide
portfolio diversity, and because it is considered a hedge against unexpected inflation because their prices
usually rise when inflation is accelerating.
Last year, investors put in nearly $6.8 billion in natural-resources mutual funds tracked by AMG Data
Services. The average natural resources mutual fund returned 45% for the year through Jan. 3, according to
Morningstar.

ETFs Stoke Investors' Gold Fever --- New Way to Trade Adds Luster to Fabled Metal; Jewelry Demand Drops
ETFs Stoke Investors' Gold Fever --- New Way to Trade Adds Luster to Fabled Metal; Jewelry Demand
Drops

Gold's place in the financial system dates back centuries, but it is enjoying a modern-day renaissance,
thanks in part to new vehicles that allow investors to buy and sell the precious metal as easily as a share of
Google stock.
The price of gold fell $3.30, or 0.4%, to $863.10 a troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Comex
division Friday, but that was after hitting a 28-year high earlier in the week. It is now up 43% from a year ago.
Investors have been flocking to it as the outlook for more-conventional investments like stocks and bonds
becomes cloudier.
Analysts point to the introduction of exchange-traded funds linked to gold as a potent new catalyst for interest
in the yellow metal. ETFs trade on exchanges like stocks, but their performance can be tied to almost
anything, from the value of commodities to the performance of stock indexes like the S&P 500 index or the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The most-active gold ETF -- called streetTracks Gold Shares, trading under the ticker GLD -- now averages
about eight million shares a day in turnover, more even than Google Inc.'s shares, which change hands less
than seven million times a day on average. GLD's underlying holdings of the precious metal are greater than
the European Central Bank's or China's central bank.
Demand from investors is driving the price of gold higher, even though demand for the metal for things like
jewelry is surprisingly soft.
"The single most important thing to understand about the gold price is that it's being driven higher by
investment," says Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a commodity-focused
financial-services firm in New York. "That investment demand has been pretty broad-based around the world,
and it doesn't look like it's close to ending."
Since early 2003, at least eight gold-related ETFs have been listed world-wide. Similar ETF offerings have
also cropped up for metals such as silver and platinum.
Most of these offerings require that each ETF share purchased by investors be backed up by actual metal
held in a trust by the ETF issuer, usually a bank or other financial firm.
The biggest is the streetTracks Gold Shares ETF, sponsored by the World Gold Council, a mining-industry
group. Its holdings are valued at more than $16.8 billion, more than the valuation of General Motors Corp.
Each share in GLD is backed by about 1/10 of an ounce of metal held in vaults in London by HSBC Bank
USA, a unit of HSBC Holdings PLC. The streetTracks ETF issues more shares as brokers see more demand
in the market, and brokers receive shares for the metal they buy and transfer to the fund.
The fund sat on about 628 metric tons of gold last month, according to the World Gold Council, more than
the 600 or so metric tons in Chinese central bank reserves and 604 metric tons with the European Central
Bank.
In all, the eight ETFs held 834 metric tons of gold through November, according to the World Gold Council.
According to CPM, gold demand among private investors prospecting for returns has nearly doubled to more
than 40 million ounces a year since the end of 2001. By contrast, global demand for gold to make jewelry
and other items has fallen nearly 13% during the period. Gold's price in the period more than tripled.

Gold was once the linchpin of the global financial system. The value of the dollar was pegged to its value.
That relationship formally ended decades ago, but some investors continue to treat it as a kind of
quasimoney, something that could hold its value even as the dollar weakens or inflation soars.
That quality is giving it added appeal now. The value of the dollar has dropped 20% against a broad swath of
other currencies since 2002 and inflation among other commodities has soared.
A succession of other developments, from the 2001 terror attacks to war in Iraq to the recent mortgage crisis,
have added to investor demand for the haven metal.
Originally popular with institutional investors such as hedge funds, such commodity-linked funds now also
draw a healthy amount of retail money from everyday investors.
Some investors worry that ETFs such as the streetTracks gold fund have added risks to the already volatile
market.
"There's no way the fundamentals justify the rally we've seen," says Leonard Kaplan, president of the
commodity-trading firm Prospector Asset Management in Evanston, Ill. Nevertheless, Mr. Kaplan himself is
jumping in. He has been buying gold-futures contracts, even though he frets that hedge-fund investment in
the commodity is driving it to extremes.
"I have to go along with the market trend right now in order to make money," Mr. Kaplan says. "It could go to
$1,200 an ounce in the short term because of sheer momentum."
George Milling-Stanley, manager of investment and market intelligence for the gold council, acknowledges
GLD has contributed to the gold rally. But he played down its role amid other drivers such as inflation
concerns and the weakness in the U.S. dollar. "There's been a bunch of reasons gold has risen the way it
has," he says. "One is easier access via gold ETFs, no question about that."

Strategist Wien
Sees Slowdown
---
List Tells Tales of Woe,
Including Inflation Rise,
Fed Funds Beneath 3%
More strategists are coming around to the idea that the economy is going to suffer a recession in 2008. One
of those is Byron Wien of Pequot Capital Management, who, in his annual list of surprises to expect in the
coming year, leads it off with the prediction that the economy will indeed contract in the next few quarters.
"Housing starts stay soft and banks are reluctant to lend to anyone where a whiff of risk is apparent," he
writes. "Federal funds drop below 3%. The unemployment rate moves definitively above 5% and consumer
spending is lackluster."
Mr. Wien's list isn't for the faint of heart. He forecasts a 10% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index,
and a jump in inflation.
With this list, of course, it is instructive to look back and see how Mr. Wien did for his 2007 list. It appears that
he had a few of his predictions dead-on: the rise in agricultural prices; the Fed refraining from lowering rates
in the spring; and Latin America doing well.
If anything, he was too conservative in a few areas, such as gold and oil, where prices rose even beyond his
projections for $800 and $80, respectively. On the downside, he fell short in his prediction for 1600 on the
S&P, Japan's Nikkei didn't gain 15% and S&P earnings didn't achieve 10% growth for the year.

If the Fords Could
Have a Do-Over . . .
Did the Ford family zig when it should have zagged?
Remember news reports back in the spring that said the family had considered hiring bankers to explore
options (read: sell) for its 40% voting stake in the eponymous auto maker? They said the family considered
and ultimately decided against hiring advisory firm Perella Weinberg for the job.
Ford's stock was then trading at about $8. With news in the past week that Ford Motor has officially been
surpassed by Toyota Motor for the No. 2 spot in U.S. auto sales, and a grim 2008 forecast from the company,
the stock now is down nearly 25%, to just above $6.
Bloomberg put it in perspective: It's the lowest price that shares of Ford have traded at since 1985, an era
eerily reminiscent of the current one, in which U.S. auto makers face a competitive onslaught from abroad.

A good portion of the Ford family -- perhaps representing as much as 40% of its stake -- was in favor of
taking the money and running last year. "They aren't sure it can be fixed," a person familiar with the matter
told Journal reporters at the time.
One has to wonder how they feel now. Has their urgency to get out grown? How about that of erstwhile
recalcitrant family members?
A Ford spokesman says the family is committed to the long-term success of the company and has been
"hugely supportive of the company's comeback plan." No discussions of any family share sales are taking
place, he said.
One thing is for sure. At least for now, those that made the decision to sell out of the U.S. -- like Daimler -- are
looking pretty smart in the rear-view mirror.

Why Luxury Will
Lose Luster
The conventional wisdom says the rich will sail through the current economic storms.
Most economic pundits have been repeating the "immunity" argument: The rich have so much money they
are immune from any downturn. They borrow less than other consumers, so they are inoculated against debt
crises. Since their homes are a small portion of their net worth, they aren't worried about the real-estate
crash.
Yet an article in the Chicago Tribune offers a reality check. It says the average amount spent by affluent
consumers on luxury dropped 21% to $12,142 in the third quarter from an average of $15,283 in the second
quarter, marking the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2004.
Coach is discounting bags, Neiman Marcus calls the environment "somewhat challenging" and Nordstom is
battling weaker sales. Unity Marketing, a firm that tracks luxury spending, uses the upscale term "ennui" to
describe the impending luxury malaise. In the article, Unity founder Pam Danziger says luxury has "likely
reached its peak."
"A lot of luxury consumers are the leaders, the movers and shakers, the people with corporate responsibilities
and the entrepreneurs," she says. "Their investment portfolios are taking a hit."
Granted, lots of luxury spending has been by middle-class consumers. Yet the rich also are likely to pull back.

Oil Retreats Slightly Even as Inventories Fall --- Upward Momentum May Ebb if Supplies Are Rebuilt Soon

Oil Retreats Slightly Even as Inventories Fall --- Upward Momentum May Ebb if Supplies Are Rebuilt

Oil prices climbed above $100 a barrel for a time yesterday as U.S. data showed national crude stocks had
fallen to their lowest level since early 2005. But some experts cautioned against reading too much into the
end-of-year snapshot.
The front-month crude-oil contract traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 44 cents, or 0.4%,
yesterday to $99.18 after trading as high as $100.09. (Please see related article on Page C2.)
U.S. crude-oil inventories dropped by four million barrels to 289.6 million barrels in the last week of 2007,
more than twice the decline expected by analysts.
Crude-oil stocks traditionally fall in the last two months of the year, rebounding later in January and in
February, analysts say. "The decreases in crude-oil stocks is a normal pattern that we see in December,"
said Laurie Falter, an economist with the Energy Information Administration, which compiles and releases the
oil-inventory information. Refiners, major holders of crude stocks, often draw down their crude-oil inventories
to reduce end-of-year taxes, she said.
If inventories are rebuilt in the coming weeks, that will likely ease some of the upward pressure on oil prices.
Should oil-producing countries increase their output of crude oil, as some analysts expect, that also could
help bring down prices later this year.
Indeed, the EIA is expecting prices to fall. Analysts continue to stick with predictions that U.S. benchmark
crude will average in the mid-$80s range this year. That is above last year's $72-a-barrel average but
considerably lower than current levels.
In the short term, traders say, the market could tip in either direction. If crude closes above $100 a barrel for
several days, it could produce enough trading leverage to push the price toward $110, well above the
inflation-adjusted high of $102.81 set in April 1980, during a period of increased political turmoil in the Middle
East. But should prices stay below $100 a barrel, momentum could shift the other direction if investors
conclude the upward trend has ebbed, traders say.
Despite soaring prices, many of the major oil-producing countries aren't likely to move quickly to boost
supplies. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which satisfies just less than 40% of world
demand, plans to meet Feb. 1 in Vienna to assess the market. But the group, led by the world's largest single
supplier, Saudi Arabia, has resisted calls to boost supplies since OPEC agreed in September to raise its
output ceiling by 500,000 barrels a day by Nov. 1.
Oil analysts say OPEC could be all the more reluctant to boost production after its February gathering
because any additions to world supplies wouldn't arrive at refineries in the U.S. or Asia until at least
mid-March, after the peak winter supply crunch.
Oil prices already are pinching the finances of consumers and companies, including those in the energy
business. The run-up in crude in recent months has inflated gasoline prices to historically high levels for this
time of year, when demand for the fuel is typically slow. Average regular gasoline prices at the pump are 72
cents a gallon higher than the $2.33 seen last year at this time.
The EIA data released yesterday showed a significant buildup in gasoline inventories, suggesting gasoline
prices could fall in the coming weeks. In other Nymex trading yesterday, February reformulated gasoline
blendstock futures fell 2.75 cents a gallon, or 1.1%, to $2.5414.
Gasoline prices are expected to continue their ups and downs, climbing again as the summer driving season
kicks in. Although high prices and signs of an economic downturn have begun to slow the growth of gasoline

--- Page 86 ---

demand, analysts believe gasoline this summer could still surge above last May's $3.26 record high because
of constraints in refining capacity and continued pressure from high oil prices.
Meanwhile, refining margins are weakening as refiners are unable to raise prices at the pump to compensate
for the soaring cost of crude. "Conversations with refiners about [fourth quarter] earnings have been very,
very sad," noted Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Sankey in a research note.
So for now, rising oil prices will likely mean eroding profits for big energy companies with refining businesses.
Governments in oil-producing nations also have been taking a bigger bite out of these companies' crude-oil
profits by demanding higher taxes. For example, ConocoPhillips, in its fourth-quarter interim results released
yesterday, told investors to expect a $250 million hit from a new Alaska production tax.

Stem-Cell Researchers Claim Embryo Labs Are Still a Necessity

The surveillance cameras and electronic locks are the only hints that a visitor has reached the border of a
scientific frontier. Behind these laboratory doors a few blocks from Columbia University in Manhattan is a
research enterprise quarantined by federal law because, for many people, it poses a moral hazard.
Inside, a technician adjusts a microscope and a cluster of human embryonic stem cells -- with the potential to
develop into the body's many cell types -- springs into view, blurred only by politics, ethics disputes and
conflicting beliefs about the beginnings of life.
A nonprofit foundation called Project ALS set up this privately funded lab -- the Jennifer Estess Laboratory for
Stem Cell Research -- 18 months ago to allow scientists to circumvent federal restrictions on experiments
with cells made from human embryos, often left over from commercial in vitro fertilization. Within its walls,
researchers from Columbia, Harvard Medical School, the Salk Institute and others are studying embryonic
cells in an effort to overcome an incurable fatal disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as
Lou Gehrig's disease.
The Estess lab is a modest outpost in a network of new state and private stem-cell biology labs that together
command billions of dollars in nonfederal funds for research into how embryonic cells might one day reverse
ALS and other conditions, such as leukemia, diabetes and Parkinson's disease.
In November, stem-cell researchers in Japan and the U.S. announced an advance that may eliminate the
need for human embryos in making stem cells. But the private charities and state agencies that established
these "safe haven" laboratories see no reason to abandon their work. "Stem cells offer us our best hope,"
said Project ALS executive director Valerie Estess.
The private embryo-research facilities, in fact, may be more in demand than ever, said Susan Solomon,
executive director of the New York Stem Cell Foundation, which has raised $10 million in private funds for
embryonic stem-cell research. At the least, more studies of human embryonic cells will be necessary to verify
the reliability of the new technique. "There is a safety issue," she said. "The last thing anyone wants is a
disaster that would shut down the field."
Sidestepping the need for human embryos, independent research teams led by Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto
University in Japan and by James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin had announced in November that
they successfully converted human skin into cells that mimic embryonic stem cells. Called "induced
pluripotent stem cells," these adult cells are altered by infecting them with a manmade virus that carries four
extra genes designed to reset the cell's machinery.
The technique was hailed as the solution to a religious and political impasse that has long stymied U.S.
stem-cell research. Congress has banned public funding for the embryo-based experiments since 1995. Last
June, President Bush for the second time vetoed legislation to loosen research restrictions.
Within weeks of the recent news, researchers at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., said they had
used the reprogrammed cells to cure sickle-cell anemia -- in mice.
For human use, the new technique may be too dangerous for the foreseeable future because the genetically
engineered virus randomly alters a cell's genetic structure, raising the risk of cancer in modified cells. Dr.
Yamanaka joined other scientists last month to urge continued stem-cell research with human embryos. "We
hold research into all avenues of human stem-cell research must proceed together," they wrote in the journal
Stem Cell.
"They are genetically changed in a way that should make us worried about using them in animals or people,
or to model diseases," said Harvard University stem-cell biologist Kevin Eggan. He also is scientific director of
the New York Stem Cell Foundation and its embryonic stem cell lab. Until the reprogrammed cells can be

made safe and stable enough for clinical experiments, he added, "Human embryonic stem cells will be better,
even if they are more complicated politically."
So far, private donors have contributed more than $190 million to underwrite research with human embryonic
stem cells, according to a partial accounting compiled by the journal Nature. Several states, including
Connecticut, Maryland, Illinois and New York, are funding experiments. By far, the world's largest sponsor of
human embryonic stem-cell research is the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, with $3 billion in
state bond funds at its disposal.
"We still think human embryonic stem cells are the gold standard," said institute president Richard Murphy.
By summer, the institute will have awarded about $519 million for stem-cell research -- most of it for work on
cells derived from surplus human embryos.
Even so, this month the California institute for the first time is seeking to award up to $13 million for stem-cell
research that doesn't destroy human embryos -- inspired, in part, by the recent genetic reprogramming
innovation. "We need to sort out the realities," said Dr. Murphy.

Crude Tests $100 Again, Retreats; Inventory Report Weighs On Prices --- Soybeans and Wheat Continue to Shoot Up, Gold Hits New High

Crude Tests $100 Again, Retreats; Inventory Report Weighs On Prices --- Soybeans and Wheat
Continue to Shoot Up, Gold Hits New High

Crude-oil futures ended slightly lower, unable for a second day to sustain a move to $100 a barrel, as an
increase in U.S. oil-product inventories outweighed a bigger-than-expected draw in crude stockpiles.
Light, sweet crude for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as high as $100.09 a
barrel, a Nymex record for a front-month contract, before slipping back below the triple-digit level. The
contract settled 44 cents, or 0.4%, lower at $99.18 a barrel. The price is still lower than the inflation-adjusted
record of $102.81 hit in 1980.
The choppy day's trade, which saw price changes flipping from negative to positive throughout, came after
the Energy Department said crude-oil stockpiles fell more than expected. Prices jumped to their record on the
report for the week ended Dec. 28, but pulled back as traders reassessed larger-than-expected inventories of
both distillates, which include heating oil and diesel and gasoline.
While prices pulled back slightly and couldn't settle higher than $100, most analysts said the outlook for oil is
strong. "The only reason we came off was the refined products built -- other than that, there isn't a lot to
indicate we shouldn't keep going higher," said Tony Rosado of IAG Energy Brokers in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
"If the market can achieve some technical consolidation over $100, it can go higher, but there's a lot of
skepticism" about how well it can hold above the psychological level.
Nymex crude hit $100 a barrel for the first time Wednesday, but went above it -- albeit slightly -- only
yesterday, after the Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude-oil inventories
fell by four million barrels to 289.6 million barrels, the lowest level since January 2005.
"Now that $100 has been broken through, we'll see crude go over that level regularly in January," said Peter
Beutel, president of trading advisory firm Cameron Hanover in New Canaan, Conn. "We're seeing the Federal
Reserve showing signs of continuing to cut interest rates, oil supply isn't keeping up with demand and OPEC
is showing no sign of trying to bring down prices."
In other commodity markets:
SOYBEANS: Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade soared amid a bullish brew of shrinking global supplies,
strong world demand and massive buying from speculative funds. The July contract, which represents the
crop to be planted this spring, set a record of $12.92 a bushel. The nearby January contract rose 19 cents to
$12.5150.
WHEAT: Chicago Board of Trade prices rose the daily exchange-set limit of 30 cents a bushel, as market
participants worried about tight global wheat supplies and as speculative funds poured money into commodity
markets. March ended at $9.45 a bushel.
GOLD: Prices on the Comex division of the Nymex rose for a second day on the back of high crude-oil prices
and the flagging U.S. dollar. January gold gained $9.40 to settle at $866.40 a troy ounce.

Dow Rally Loses Steam by Day's End

Stocks tried to rebound from Wednesday's big decline, but the gains fizzled by day's end amid persistent
worries about the economy and jitters about today's employment report from the Labor Department.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.76 points, or 0.1%, to close at 13056.72, after rising 90 points in
the early afternoon. The blue-chip average is down 1.6% for the first two trading days of the year.
"I don't think [Wednesday's] problems have been resolved," said Matthew Johnson, head of U.S. stock
trading at Lehman Brothers. "The market is pricing in recession, and there isn't a tremendous appetite for
risk."
Crude-oil futures briefly touched $100.09 a barrel, after hitting $100 for first time during the day Wednesday,
but ended down 44 cents at $99.18 barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil is just 3.5% below its
inflation-adjusted U.S. high of $102.81, set in April 1980.
Gold, traditionally considered a haven in times of uncertainty, rose $9.40 to a fresh high of $866.40 a troy
ounce in New York.
That surpasses the $847-an-ounce record set in January 1980, although it remains far below the
inflation-adjusted price of more than $2,120 that the 1980 price would represent in today's dollars.
Some of Wednesday's stock-market losers continued to decline, including technology shares and some
financials. Intel, a Dow component, fell 2.7%. Wachovia slid 1.6%.
The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 6.95 points, or 0.3%, to 2602.68. The broad Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index was unchanged at 1447.16.
In economic news, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 1.5% in November, the biggest jump
in four months. Although the report somewhat counterbalanced disappointing manufacturing numbers
Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management, the ISM report was more recent -- from December --
and higher factory orders were largely the result of inflation.
Job-market data from Automatic Data Processing, Monster Worldwide's Monster.com and others yesterday
did little to change economists' expectations that the government numbers will show lackluster job growth in
December.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks were mixed. Total trading volume for New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks was 3.38 billion shares,
as 1,737 stocks rose and 1,549 fell.
Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 invested, to push up the
yield to 3.903%. The 30-year bond fell 12/32 to yield 4.370%.
The dollar weakened. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell to 109.23 yen from 109.49, while the
euro rose against the dollar to $1.4750 from $1.4729.

Oil and the Dollar
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Oil and the Dollar

Oil prices finally hit $100 a barrel this week, albeit briefly, but breaking through that symbolic barrier is
ominous and higher gasoline prices are sure to follow. Supply disruptions in various places and surging
demand in China and India are part of the explanation for this decade's upward trend in oil prices. But
perhaps the biggest factor has been largely overlooked: the decline in the value of the dollar.
Since 2001 the dollar price of oil and gold have run in almost perfect tandem. The gold price has risen 239%
since 2001, while the oil price has risen 267%. This means that if the dollar had remained "as good as gold"
since 2001, oil today would be selling at about $30 a barrel, not $99. Gold has traditionally been a rough
proxy for the price level, so the decline of the dollar against gold and oil suggests a U.S. monetary that is
supplying too many dollars.
We would add that the dollar price of nearly all commodities -- from wheat to corn to copper to silver -- are
also surging, a further sign of a weakening currency. On Wednesday alone the price of wheat and soybeans
increased 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. That follows a 75% increase in their price in 2007 -- which ran ahead
of the oil price, which gained a mere 57% for the year. Neither OPEC nor China caused food commodity
prices to rise like this. The main culprit here is a global loss of confidence in Federal Reserve policy and the
dollar.
This state of affairs is all too similar to what happened in the commodity markets in the 1970s -- particularly
the energy markets. Oil price spikes in that stagflationary decade were driven less by OPEC than by the
weak-dollar policies pursued by the Fed. Gold in that decade broke from its traditional $35 an ounce mooring
and climbed as high as $850 in 1980, before Paul Volcker began to restore the Fed's credibility.
Another way to consider the impact of the weak dollar is to examine what would have happened if the dollar
had simply kept pace with the euro in this decade. What would oil cost today? Not $100, but closer to $57 a
barrel. The nearby chart gives a sense of the comparative trend since 2000.
A weak dollar has been trumpeted in the business media and especially among manufacturers as a strategy
to lower the trade deficit. But this strategy makes imported oil a lot more expensive. The trade figures reveal
that a major contributor to the rising trade deficit over this decade has been the high cost of oil imports. We
don't worry about the trade deficit -- except in so far as it inspires protectionism -- but those who do might
want to consider that the weak dollar policy they are cheering is making fuel very expensive.
We aren't saying that supply problems and an increase in relative demand haven't played a role in oil's rise.
Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimates that "aggregate supply disruptions" reduced oil supply by
almost two million barrels a day in late 2007, which isn't helping prices. But the high price of oil is not a
vindication of theorists who say we are confronting "peak oil."
A report issued this summer by the National Petroleum Council and energy experts across the spectrum
concluded that "the world is not running out of energy resources," though it conceded that "there are
accumulating risks to continuing expansion of oil and natural gas production from the conventional sources."
Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy notes that in the energy markets "most of these risks are above ground,
not below ground." By that he's referring to the tendency of politicians to intervene in the energy markets in
any number of harmful ways. We'd offer barriers to drilling in Alaska and on the Continental Shelf as Exhibit A
and B in this country.
Rising oil prices act like a tax on American consumers. With the economy slowing, the Fed is now under
intense pressure to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy and provide liquidity to the banking industry.
But if this causes the dollar to continue to weaken, the tax of higher commodity prices will offset much of the
"stimulus" from looser money. The Fed will get a lot less bang for its easier buck.

The larger danger here, as we've been warning for some time, is that the U.S. seems to be returning to the
Carter-era economic policy mix of tight fiscal policy (tax increases) and easy money. Add barriers to oil and
natural gas production and you have a recipe for higher oil prices and slower growth. In a word, for
stagflation. The Reagan-Volcker policy mix of the 1980s changed all that, but maybe we have to relearn the
hard way every generation or so what works -- and what produces $100 oil.

Fed's Inflation Fears Might Trump Calls for Another Big Rate Cut --- Monetary-Policy Makers Appear
to Have Less Room To Maneuver Than in Past

Slowing factory activity, weakening job growth and a credit crunch have investors expecting aggressive
interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
But this week's surge in the prices of oil and gold underlines why the Fed may not have the freedom to ease
monetary policy as much as it did in 2001, when the economy slumped, or as much as many on Wall Street
want.
The Fed and the markets agree the economic outlook is worrisome. Minutes of the Fed's December meeting
released Wednesday show Fed policy makers share Wall Street's concern that the economy could fall into
recession. The minutes raised the prospect of "substantial" further rate cuts if a self-reinforcing spiral of
tightening credit and weaker growth develops.
The real disconnect is over inflation. The Fed thinks it is a bigger risk than it was in 2001, and bigger than
Wall Street and many prominent economists think. That forces the Fed to accept a greater risk of recession
than it did in 2001. That could mean either fewer rate cuts than anticipated by futures markets, which see the
Fed's short-term rate target falling to 3% by year-end from 4.25% now, or a quicker reversal of the rate cuts.
Today's situation is in sharp contrast to the Fed's last rate-cutting cycle. In early May 2001, a survey of
private-sector forecasters put the odds of recession at 35%. But by that point the Fed, under then-Chairman
Alan Greenspan, had already slashed its target for the federal funds rate by two percentage points, to 4.5%,
while declaring weak growth to be a bigger worry than inflation. The economy ultimately did experience a
mild recession in part because of that September's terrorist attacks, and the funds rate ended the year at
1.75%.
Today, private-sector economists put the odds of recession at 38%, yet the Fed has cut the funds rate only
one percentage point since August and has yet to say weaker growth worries it more than inflation.
Mr. Greenspan, who retired last year, said in a recent interview that inflation risks are much greater today
than in 2001 and thus his successor, Ben Bernanke, has less freedom to shore up the economy with steep
rate cuts than he did. "This is a much tougher monetary-policy environment than anything I experienced," he
said.
The most obvious inflationary threat is from oil. It has risen to almost $100 a barrel now from $61 at the end
of 2006. That has sent the 12-month overall inflation rate up sharply, to 4.3% in November. By contrast, oil
hovered just at just less than $30 for most of 2001 before sinking after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and
inflation ended the year at 1.6%.
The Fed pays more attention to core inflation, which is less volatile because it excludes food and energy.
But that picture is also troubling. Since April 2004, core inflation measured by the Fed's preferred price index
has been at or above the top of policy makers' preferred 1.5% to 2% for all but five months, notes Doug
Elmendorf, a former Fed economist who is now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. It dipped in the spring
of last year before edging higher by year end.
The Fed, by allowing inflation to consistently run higher than its preferred range, risks feeding higher
expectations of inflation in the public, which will make it harder to get inflation back down, Mr. Elmendorf
noted.
Similar concerns bedevil the European Central Bank, whose ability to lower rates has been constrained by
inflation of 3.1% in the countries that use the euro. The ECB aims to hold inflation just below 2%.

--- Page 95 ---

Perhaps the most important contrast with 2001 is one that gets little attention. Back then, the Greenspan-led
Fed was optimistic that the spread of new technology had boosted worker productivity growth and thus the
speed at which the economy could grow without bumping up against capacity constraints. Fed staff that June
put the economy's noninflationary "potential growth" rate at 3.4%.
Since then, slower growth in both productivity and the labor force has led Fed policy makers to put potential
growth at only about 2.5%. Thus, inflationary bottlenecks could develop at much more moderate growth rates
than they did in 2001.
Vincent Reinhart, a former senior Fed staffer now at the American Enterprise Institute, said that pessimistic
view of potential growth anchors officials' inflation concerns. It changes little between meetings, so it is
discussed less than the rapidly changing prospects for growth. But Mr. Reinhart said the persistence of that
concern is why the Fed has yet to put growth concerns clearly ahead of inflation in its postmeeting
statements.
To many outsiders, the inflation concern is misplaced. "I see little chance of the kind of wage-price spiral that
has set off inflation in the past," former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, now a managing director at
hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw Group, said in a recent speech. "If I'm wrong and [easier monetary policy]
creates undue inflation pressures, they can be removed gradually at a moment of much less financial peril."
Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein has also called for sharp cuts in interest rates, arguing that if
higher inflation results, "the Fed would have to engineer a longer period of slower growth to bring the
inflation rate back to its desired level."
But if inflation does rise as a result of overly easy monetary policy now, getting it back down could require
much tighter monetary policy and even a recession.
"If in fact the economy bounces back fairly quickly and inflation remains elevated, then if monetary policy is
very aggressive now, you might find yourself in a terribly inflation-risky environment later next year," Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser, one of the Fed's most hawkish policy makers, said
in a recent interview. And if inflation expectations rise, getting them back down "might prove to be costly."
Mr. Bernanke, whose term is up for renewal in 2010, certainly wants to avoid a recession. But he would
probably prefer a mild recession now to a high risk of increased inflation and a deeper recession later.

Stocks Stumble Into '08 --- Stars of 2007 Decline As Selling Takes Hold Beyond Financials

Stocks Stumble Into '08 --- Stars of 2007 Decline As Selling Takes Hold Beyond Financials

Last year, investors focused their wrath on housing and financial stocks in the belief that the broad economy
could withstand the mortgage crisis. On the first trading day of 2008, investors appeared to change their
minds, dumping shares across the board, including some of last year's big winners.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 220.86 points, or 1.7%, to 13043.96. It was the worst first-day
percentage performance for the Dow since a 1.9% plunge on the first trading day of 1983. Conventional
market wisdom holds that an early stumble for the market is a bad omen for the rest of the year -- but it is
worth noting that the Dow rose 20% in 1983.
Among the worst-performing stocks in the blue-chip index were its biggest gainers of 2007. Honeywell
International, which rose 36.1% last year to make it the No. 1 Dow stock, tumbled 2.7% yesterday. Intel,
which rose nearly 32% last year on hopes the technology sector would thrive amid booming global demand,
plunged 4.9% after Bank of America Securities cut its rating on Intel and several other computer-chip makers.
Only one Dow component, Pfizer, rose.
The Nasdaq Composite Index, which outpaced the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last year,
sank 42.65 points, or 1.6%, to 2609.63 yesterday. The S&P 500 fell 21.20, or 1.4%, to 1447.16.
"The risk is that the industrials become the financials; that's what people are worried about," said Tony
Dwyer, equity market strategist at FTN Midwest Securities. "That means the equity market decline may not be
near an end."
The market's losses worsened when crude-oil prices momentarily touched $100 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. But the selling began long before that, when the Institute for Supply Management said
its index of U.S. manufacturing activity tumbled to 47.7% in December from 50.8% in November, well below
economists' expectations that the index would hold steady.
The report had an immediate, negative impact on stocks, raising fears that the troubles that last year seemed
confined to the financial and housing sectors were spreading to the manufacturing sector and beyond.
Any ISM reading below 50 indicates contraction in the factory sector, but the index would have to fall much
further to imply a shrinking broader economy. Still, Wall Street was not optimistic.
"A lot of us think the economy is at a tipping point and it wouldn't take much to kick it into a recession, and
anything that is a piece of evidence that would support that view is going to get you a bigger reaction these
days," said Richard F. Moody, chief economist and director of research at Mission Residential in Austin,
Texas.
Few sectors were spared the selling. The Dow Jones Oil and Gas stocks index managed to rise 0.8%, getting
a lift from $100 oil.
But last year's losers kept losing, as the Dow Jones Financials Index fell 2.3% and the Dow Jones
home-construction stocks index plunged more than 3%. Even defensive industries such as utilities and
consumer staples were lower on the day.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest rate-setting meeting briefly offered some relief, as some Fed policy
makers saw the potential need for "substantial further easing of policy."
The Dow at one point had recovered more than 50 points from its lows of the day, but the blue-chip index
soon fell again. Light, post-holiday volume contributed to the volatility.

--- Page 97 ---

Still, the reaction to the ISM data in other markets was stark. Treasury bond prices soared, pushing yields
lower, as investors fled to safety and placed bets on greater economic weakness. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note tumbled to 3.901% from 4.03% on Monday.
The dollar tumbled to a five-week low against the yen and a three-week low against the euro. But that was no
boon to exporting companies or industries that tend to benefit from a weaker dollar. For example, shares of
McDonald's, which rose 33% last year, fell 1.4% yesterday.
The combination of growing recession fears, soaring oil prices, a sinking dollar and a higher "prices paid"
component of the ISM report helped drive Comex gold for January delivery to a record-high close of $857 an
ounce.
While the Dow's percentage decline was the worst in 25 years, its point loss was the worst in its 111-year
history. Some traders look to the first trading days of January as an indicator of how the rest of the year will
fare. It is typically a bullish month for markets, as portfolio managers put new money to work and try new
strategies.
Still, few observers were willing to give too much weight to the fact that yesterday's trading was so awful,
given the light volume and the fact that "breadth," or the ratio of declining shares to advancing shares, was
not so bad. Still, it was an ominous beginning to the new year.
"The sentiment certainly shifted today," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald.
Outside the U.S., stocks fell slightly in dollar terms. (The Japanese market was closed.) The Dow Jones
World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 0.48 point, or 0.18%, to 271.36.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks fell. Total trading volume for New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks was 3.39 billion shares, as 1,355
stocks rose and 1,911 fell.
Bonds rallied. The price on the 10-year Treasury rose 1 3/32 points, or $10.94 per $1,000 invested, to push
down the yield to 3.901%. The 30-year bond rose 1 28/32 to push down the yield to 4.35%.
The dollar weakened. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell to 109.49 from 111.58, while the euro
rose against the dollar to $1.4729 from $1.4597. This is the lowest level for the dollar against the yen since
Nov. 27, 2007.

As the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked the worst year-opener in its 111-year history, member Intel was
a prime contributor and Starbucks was ground to a 2004 level, but Barrick Gold and other mining stocks
glistened.
"The contraction shown in today's manufacturing report, as well as increased inflation, was the
worst-possible scenario because higher costs will restrain the Federal Reserve's ability to use rate cuts to
spur the economy," said Dan McMahon, head of cash trading at CIBC World Markets. "Matters were
compounded by the strength in crude and the weakness in the dollar."
The Dow Jones industrials fell 220.86 points, or 1.7%, to 13043.96, as 29 of 30 members declined. Pfizer
rose 18 cents to 22.91. Until yesterday, the Dow's biggest point drop on the first session of a year had been
140.70 points, on Jan. 2, 2001.
Intel (Nasdaq) fell 1.31, or 4.9%, to 25.35, the Dow industrial average's biggest percentage decliner and the
company's biggest percentage drop in nearly a year. The semiconductor maker was caught up in selling as
Banc of America Securities cut shares of chip companies, seeing an "unfavorable" fundamental picture with
the potential for some downward revision to global economic-growth expectations.
Starbucks (Nasdaq) lost 1.16, or 5.7%, to 19.31, a 3 1/2-year low. Bear Stearns cut shares of the
coffee-house chain to "peer perform" from "outperform," saying dairy costs remain "stubbornly high" and
could significantly pressure margins.
Barrick Gold rose 3.97, or 9.4%, to 46.02; Kinross Gold gained 1.75, or 9.5%, to 20.15; and Goldcorp
advanced 2.71, or 8%, to 36.64. Gold stocks were among the Big Board's best gainers as the price of the
precious metal rose to a record on crude's strength and the weak dollar.

It's Time
To Add Inflation
To Worry List
For many years, investors have kept inflation crossed off their list of worries. But with oil prices near $100 a
barrel, gold tickling record highs and many agricultural commodities hitting new records, one has to wonder
how long they can keep ignoring it.
The bigger worry today is clearly economic growth. Bond prices rallied yesterday, sending bond yields lower
-- as often happens when recession fears mount -- after the Institute for Supply Management reported a
surprisingly steep drop in its index of manufacturing activity. The ISM's index slid to its lowest level in nearly
five years, suggesting the industrial sector might already be contracting.
A weak economy often reduces inflation pressure. Investors seem to think this will give the Federal Reserve
a freer hand to reduce short-term interest rates to prevent a broader recession. The Fed has already
lowered its target short-term interest rate three times since September to 4.25% from 5.25%.
But its choices are getting harder by the day. Minutes from the Fed's December meeting, released yesterday,
noted that even as policy makers acknowledged the potential need for more rate cuts, some worried that
increases in commodity prices "may put renewed upward pressure on inflation." Even though the U.S.
economy is weak, demand for commodities is strong outside the U.S.
The ISM's report underscored the dilemma. Even as customer orders shrank, many manufacturers had to pay
their own suppliers more. While 43% of manufacturers reported they paid higher prices last month; only 7%
said prices fell. One chemical producer reported "a large volume of price increase notices," while a metals
company said "higher raw material prices are squeezing margins."
"The signs are pretty persuasive that we have an inflation problem," says James Grant, editor of Grant's
Interest Rate Observer.
Investors still don't seem to think this will tie the Fed's hands. Futures markets showed investors now seem
assured of another rate cut in January. A steeper run in oil and gold prices, however, might eventually
change their minds.
Monsanto Is Beneficiary
Of Price Boom in Grains
Oil and gold aren't the only commodities shooting up. Grain prices have also surged, largely due to rising
demand for corn-based ethanol, the gasoline substitute.
That's been a boon for chemical and fertilizer makers, the best-performing sector in the Standard & Poor's
1500 index in 2007. It rose 108%.
Today's fiscal first-quarter earnings report by Monsanto will be an early look at one of the stronger performers
in the sector. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expect the seed and chemical maker to post earnings
excluding some one-time items of 35 cents a share, more than doubling last year's 16-cent profit.

Monsanto has enjoyed big growth in its DeKalb corn seed line, which captured 23% of the North American
seed market in 2007, up from 10% in 2001, according to Morningstar. Corn prices were up 15% in December
from a year earlier. The federal government's latest energy bill broadens mandates for ethanol production.
This makes Monsanto one stock that is benefiting from pressures hurting the rest of the market. It also makes
it a place to look for signs of the next big market bubble.

Oil and Gold Continue to Party --- Despite Economic Concerns, New Year Starts Strong for Commodities
Commodities Report
Oil and Gold Continue to Party --- Despite Economic Concerns, New Year Starts Strong for
Commodities

A broad-based global commodity boom, now more than five years old, shows no sign of slowing despite
apparent head winds.
That was made clear yesterday as prices for oil, gold, wheat and a range of other goods started the New
Year as if 2007 never ended, continuing up.
The spotlight was on oil, which briefly hit $100 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange
before closing at $99.62, up 3.8%. This was the highest close ever, and is just $3.19, or 3.1%, below its
inflation-adjusted record of $102.81, set in April 1980 in U.S. cash markets.
It wasn't alone. A slowing economy could take the wind out of commodities, but the boom keeps finding fresh
fuel, with the exception of some industrial metals. Strong demand outside the U.S. and tight supplies are key
factors.
More than a dozen major commodities posted double-digit percentage increases in 2007 and have kept
rising. Wheat and soybeans rose more than crude oil's 57% gain last year. The two agricultural commodities
posted gains of 77% and 75%, respectively. They rose a further 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively, yesterday. Last
year, rice and corn also had robust runs, along with silver and platinum prices. They also rose yesterday.
Like oil, some of these commodities are closing in on their inflation-adjusted highs. Gold is an exception. It
closed at a record $857 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. That was up 2.65%, though it was still
considerably shy of the mark $2,287 in 1980 when adjusted for inflation.
Many experts maintain that these frothy commodity markets are long overdue for a correction -- in part, they
say, because growth in China and other developing economies will slow as the fallout from a U.S. slowdown
spreads.
Many big commodity consumers, such as China, depend heavily on exports to the U.S. These countries
could also become more efficient users of commodities, tempering their demand.
But new factors are emerging that could pull up disparate raw-materials markets in unison.
Still-rising global energy demand is having a growing spillover effect on other raw materials. Efforts to ramp
up crude production increases demand for the metals that go into equipment and energy infrastructure. As
energy prices rise, demand for fuels made from renewable resources like crops rises, increasing demand for
farmland and pushing up food prices. This all can lead to higher labor costs. Inflation and recession fears
both spur investors to invest in gold as a haven.
In his well-known annual list of 10 surprises for the New Year, Byron Wien, chief investment strategist of
Pequot Capital Management Inc., predicted corn will rise to $6 a bushel this year; it closed at $4.625 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Mr. Wien, a longtime commodities bull who tries to make his list provocative as well as prescient, sees gold
reaching $1,000 an ounce "as disillusionment with paper currencies spreads across Asia."
Some analysts say the weak economy -- and the Federal Reserve's reaction to it -- cuts both ways for some
commodities, notably gold. The threat of recession could force the Fed to keep cutting short-term interest
rates.

--- Page 104 ---

That would effectively increase the supply of dollars sloshing through global markets, which could further
depress the dollar's value and support gold prices. In some parts of the world, gold is viewed as a tangible
alternative to hard currencies.
"You've got high energy prices, high agricultural prices, the dollar weakening and geopolitical instability. This
is an extremely powerful combination, which is leading to gold hitting new records today," said Bart Melek,
global commodity strategist with BMO Capital Markets.
Gold-fund manager Joe Foster, of Van Eck Global, a New York money-management firm, believes gold
could hit $1,000 a troy ounce by the end of the first quarter. He's also bullish on silver, but is a bear on
industrial metals. "If we get a full-blown recession, you could see these things post [annual] declines," says
Mr. Foster.
Industrial metals already have seen signs of a slowdown. Many metals fell in 2007, notably aluminum -- a big
component of cars, airplanes and houses -- and nickel -- used in stainless-steel appliances. Copper, used in
pipes and electric supplies, fell in the fourth quarter but rose 6% over the full year.
Other factors are supporting commodity prices. Constraints in the supply of raw materials have worsened
since the boom began, potentially adding fuel to its fire.
Among the factors that helped to lift oil yesterday was a new report in a journal published by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The article, written by a government official in Dubai, contended the oil
cartel will be much harder pressed than previously thought to meet the world's surging oil needs and could
realistically fail to supply its share of global oil markets by 2037.
Moreover, some analysts argue global commodities consumption has a long way to run. The pace of India's
oil and metals consumption has only begun to gather speed, according to a recent report by BCA Research.
BCA contends per capita commodities consumption in India is at levels hit 15 years ago in China. The
country is still less oriented toward manufacturing and India has lagged behind China in investing in
infrastructure. BCA predicts that a capital-spending boom under way in India will pick up, and "raise the floor
under many commodities prices."
Some investors also are turning to commodities as an alternative to other markets. "People have no
confidence in stocks at this point, and bonds aren't offering great returns," says Ron Lawson, a partner at the
commodity-focused investment firm Lawson/O'Neill Global Institutional Commodity Advisors in New York.
"They still need someplace to put their money. These [commodity] markets are providing that outlet."
In other commodity markets:
ORANGE JUICE: Prices on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange rose, as traders fretted about cold weather
forecast for Florida citrus-growing areas. January frozen concentrated orange juice gained 3.7 cents to settle
at $1.473 a pound.
NATURAL GAS: Futures ended almost 5% higher, bolstered by a cold snap in the Eastern U.S. and record oil
prices. Natural gas for February delivery settled 36.7 cents, or 4.9%, higher at $7.85 a million British thermal
units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Oil Hits $100, Jolting Markets --- Crude, Gold Soar; Stocks Off Sharply On Economy Fears
Oil Hits $100, Jolting Markets --- Crude, Gold Soar; Stocks Off Sharply On Economy Fears

Oil and gold futures closed at all-time highs, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its steepest
percentage decline in a New Year debut since 1983, as mounting fears for the economy sent investors to
places they consider safer than U.S. stocks.
Oil futures briefly touched $100 a barrel for the first time before settling at $99.62, while the Dow industrials
fell 220.86 points, or 1.67%, to 13043.96. Other stock benchmarks in the U.S. and Europe also sagged.
A growing number of money managers now fear that turmoil in the nation's housing and credit markets will
worsen, and that the economies of Western Europe and Japan also could suffer. But many remain hopeful
that economic growth elsewhere, including booming India and China, won't be bruised by the troubles in the
U.S.
As a result, money has flowed into markets still thought to be holding up: Commodities, like oil and
agricultural products, and emerging-market stocks that would benefit from global growth. In India, the main
local stock index hit a record yesterday.
Oil's close on the New York Mercantile Exchange was the highest ever in nominal terms, and only slightly
below the inflation-adjusted record of $102.81 set in April 1980. Investors also sought safety in gold and
U.S. government bonds.
Historically, the end of December and start of January are a strong period for U.S. stocks, as investors buy in
anticipation of new retirement money entering the market. This year, the Dow industrials are down 3.7% since
Dec. 26, a sign of investor anxiety.
Prices of Treasury bonds soared yesterday, pushing the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below
4%, to 3.901%, near its lowest level of the past year.
Gold futures jumped $22.10 to $857 a troy ounce, the highest nominal finish ever in New York. That
surpasses the $847-an-ounce record set in January 1980, although it remains far below the
inflation-adjusted price of more than $2,120 that the 1980 price would represent in today's dollars.
"We think the U.S. consumer is going to keep pulling back and ultimately that is going to slow everything
down," said Henry Herrmann, chief executive at investment-management firm Waddell & Reed in Overland
Park, Kan., which oversees about $63 billion. Mr. Herrmann was more hopeful about six weeks ago. Now, he
worries increasingly that the U.S. could be headed for recession. His firm is pulling back from investments
that would suffer most in a downturn.
He points to his firm's $10 billion Asset Strategy Fund, which has the freedom to invest in almost any area it
chooses. It currently has 14% of its portfolio in gold -- the metal itself, rather than gold stocks. An additional
30% is in cash or in hedges such as options that permit it to sell stocks if they fall too much.
Only about half the fund is exposed to the stock market's vagaries, mostly in the form of defensive stocks like
energy and health-care issues that the fund's managers think will hold up the best in a weak economy. A year
ago, 80% of the fund's portfolio was stocks.
One catalyst for yesterday's selloff was a monthly report from the Institute for Supply Management that
showed U.S. manufacturing activity declining in December to its weakest reading since April 2003.
Economists had expected manufacturing activity to continue its expansion, albeit slowly.
"Overall, this is a seriously weak report," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics. He noted that new orders, an indication of future manufacturing activity, were an area of
particular weakness. One weak reading doesn't mean the economy is in recession, but it is a negative sign.

That's why investors are trying to get away from investments whose fortunes are linked to the health of the
economy and, in particular, to the housing sector. "The economic weakness we have is U.S.-housing-centric.
The closer you are to the U.S. housing sector, the weaker the numbers are. The farther away you are, the
more favorable the numbers have been," said Richard Hoey, chief economist at Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. "There is still a positive sense about the outlook for expansion in the emerging-market countries."
While the Dow industrials are up just 4.6% in the past year, the Morgan Stanley Capital International
Emerging Markets Index has gained 33.4% in dollar terms.
Despite the day's declines in U.S. stocks, there are still plenty of bulls, who believe that the economy and the
American consumer will prove more resilient than the doubters expect. As stocks dependent on economic
growth were plunging yesterday -- indexes of bank stocks, transportation stocks and computer-chip stocks fell
more than 2% -- those bullish investors were buying, helping pull broad-market indexes up slightly from
intraday lows.
But the optimists were in the minority yesterday. Some investors, such as Mr. Herrmann of Waddell & Reed,
said they feared that U.S. economic troubles could spread to emerging markets as well, because they
depend on the U.S. market for their exports. Mr. Herrmann said he doesn't view emerging-market stocks as
much of a refuge.
Other money managers worried that emerging markets such as China and India already have risen too much,
and are overdue for a pullback. Although stocks in those two countries rose yesterday, indexes in Brazil,
Hong Kong and Singapore declined.
Many investors continue to pile into emerging markets in pursuit of robust gains, even though shares there
are no longer the bargain they once were. When Russell Indexes searched its global stock database for last
year's best-performing shares in dollar terms, 48 of the top 100 stocks were from India, China, Brazil or
Russia -- with 41 from India alone. Only six U.S.-based stocks made the list. The benchmark indexes of India,
Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia all climbed more than 40% last year.
That has contributed to fears that these markets could be headed for a tumble. Analysts worry especially
about China, where a speculative frenzy helped push the Shanghai Composite Index 97% higher last year,
even though the market is largely closed to foreign investors.
Even so, funds that specifically target emerging markets received $40.8 billion in net inflows from investors
last year, according to Emerging Portfolio Fund Research. Funds focusing on U.S. stocks received net
inflows of just $1.2 billion.
The proportion of emerging-market stocks in the international mutual fund overseen by Uri Landesman, a
senior fund manager at ING Investment Management in New York, recently hit "the highest it's ever been in
my career," Mr. Landesman said. He said the percentage is in the low 20s.
These countries "still have by far the most attractive growth prospects in the world, assuming there isn't a
hard landing in the U.S.," he said. "That's where I'm finding interesting ideas." Still, he said he is looking to
take profits on emerging-market stocks that did extremely well in 2007 and is monitoring his biggest bets,
which are in places like Russia, China, South Korea and Turkey.
At the end of last year, the stocks in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index were trading at 17.03 times profits for
the prior 12 months, a higher multiple than for MSCI's index tracking the world as a whole. MSCI's index of
Indian stocks, however, traded at 32.8 times prior-year earnings. Stocks in Brazil and Russia weren't as
expensive, trading at just 15.5 and 14.1 times the prior year's earnings, MSCI calculated. That's cheaper than
MSCI's index of U.S. stocks, which traded at 17.2 times prior earnings.

Oil Hits $100, Jolting Markets --- Boom Cuts U.S. Clout, Revives Middle East; Dark Days for Detroit

The surging price of oil, from just over $10 a barrel a decade ago to $100 yesterday, is altering the wealth
and influence of nations and industries around the world.
These power shifts will only widen if prices keep climbing, as many analysts predict. Costly oil already is
forcing sweeping changes in the airline and auto sectors. It is intensifying the politics of climate change and
adding urgency to the search both for fresh sources of crude and for oil alternatives once deemed fringe.
The long oil-price boom is posing wrenching challenges for the world's poorest nations, while enriching and
emboldening producers in the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela. Their increasing muscle has a flip side: a
decline of U.S. clout in many parts of the world.
Steep gasoline prices also threaten America's long love affair with the automobile, while putting strains on
many lower-income people outside big cities, who must spend an increasing share of their budgets just on
fuel to get to work.
No one can say for sure whether sky-high oil -- part of a price boom in a wide range of commodities, from
gold to wheat -- is here to stay. But most in the industry agree that a 20-year stretch in which oil was
consistently cheap is long gone. The global thirst for oil shows little sign of retreating, and large new
discoveries are few. Some in the industry say prices could go far higher; others suspect that speculators -- or
an economic slump in the U.S. or China -- could send prices falling in the near term.
Yesterday, with a single trade, crude-oil futures hit an intraday high of $100 a barrel, a record for the U.S.
benchmark. For the day, they rose $3.64 to a record close of $99.62 a barrel. Crude is still shy of the
inflation-adjusted peak of $102.81 a barrel set in April 1980, amid political turmoil in Iran and unrest
elsewhere in the Middle East. The 1980 peak in nominal terms was $39.50 a barrel.
The arrival of $100-a-barrel oil adds to the pressure on the U.S. economy, which has sustained a big blow
from a drop in housing prices and a wave of foreclosures. Even at today's prices, though, the oil spike alone
isn't enough to push the world into recession, economists say.
When crude oil hit its 1980 high, drivers squealed and the economy slumped. So far there is no comparable
pain, and America, which consumes a quarter of the world's crude, retains its taste for big cars and
energy-devouring homes. That's largely because the U.S. economy is more efficient and most Americans
spend less of their disposable income -- about 4% -- on gasoline than in 1980, when they spent about 6%.
The robust economies of Asia, especially China, have so far swallowed the price surges with relative ease.
That's because the price spurt this time is itself largely caused by surging demand within the developing
world, not by politically induced supply shocks as in the 1970s and early 1980s.
But there are signs of strain. China, in a bid to limit demand and the huge fuel subsidies it gives consumers,
announced in October that it would impose an almost 10% increase in domestic prices for gasoline and diesel
fuel. Other countries that heavily subsidize domestic fuel use, which include the oil-rich states Iran and
Venezuela, are feeling the pinch as prices climb.
Oil's run-up is bringing the most startling changes of all to the Middle East. Big producers like Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates are using their billions in profits to build their economies with roads, schools,
airports and entire new cities. The value of hydrocarbon exports from the Middle East and Central Asia is
expected to approach $750 billion this year, almost four times the level in 2001, according to the International
Monetary Fund.
The region's new wealth has triggered a bout of deal making that has bankers rushing to the petrostates of
the Persian Gulf. McKinsey & Co. estimates that the world's biggest investors of petrodollars -- including
state-owned vehicles known as sovereign-wealth funds -- now manage as much as $3.8 trillion in assets. The

Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which McKinsey estimates manages $900 billion in assets, is today among
the world's largest financial-market participants -- about the same size as the Bank of Japan.
Underscoring the region's new global financial heft, Abu Dhabi recently swooped to the rescue of Citigroup
Inc. with a $7.5 billion cash infusion as it struggled with write-downs from this year's credit crisis.
Even before that deal, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which
includes Abu Dhabi, spent about $124.3 billion in the past three years buying up foreign companies, real
estate and other assets, according to London-based Dealogic. One transaction underscores the region's
financial-markets ambitions. Dubai, also part of the UAE, agreed to a complex deal with Nasdaq Stock Market
Inc. that essentially gives Dubai major stakes in Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange and Nordic exchange
OMX AB. that essentially gives Dubai major stakes in Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange and Nordic
exchange
This wave of oil wealth is blunting America's influence. Oil money has galvanized the might of Russia under
President Vladimir Putin. He has overseen a dramatic consolidation of power and rollback of democracy in
Moscow, while sticking a thumb in the West's eye on issues ranging from independence for Kosovo to the
U.S. bid to build an anti-Iran missile-defense system in Europe.
Surging oil prices have also weakened the Bush administration's efforts to use financial pressure to get Iran
to back off its nuclear program. China, eager to secure all possible access to energy, increasingly is turning to
Iran as a trading partner, with oil going east and Chinese technology heading the other way. High oil revenue,
meanwhile, has kept the otherwise rickety Iranian economy humming and Iran's current government firmly in
power.
In Khartoum, the once-drowsy capital of Sudan, glimmering skyscrapers are rising along the Nile as oil riches
attract investors from Asia and the Persian Gulf. Sudan, accused by Washington of supporting terror groups
and killing civilians in Darfur, had been hobbled for years by U.S. economic sanctions. Those restrictions are
having less effect now, with the desire for oil resources high and with both know-how and capital pouring in
from the Gulf and Asia.
Venezuela will continue to use its oil prod, perhaps more aggressively than any other country. In 2005, in one
of a series of jabs at the U.S., Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez began offering cut-rate heating oil to poor
neighborhoods of the Northeastern U.S. He also has used favorably priced fuel to prop up Fidel Castro and
win friends in South America, while shouldering aside U.S. efforts to champion regional trade deals.
For poor nations that don't produce oil, the past several years have been a full-blown oil shock. The price rise
adds another obstacle to providing modern energy to the estimated 1.6 billion people who have no access to
electricity and the 2.4 billion who cook with traditional sources like wood, coal or dung. A recent World Bank
study concluded that a sustained $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil translates roughly into a 1.5%
knock to the gross domestic product of the world's poorest countries.
Few places have been harder hit than Malawi, a small southern Africa country with annual per capita gross
domestic product of just $179. According to the World Bank report, a $10 oil-price increase is expected to
translate into a 2.2% fall in the GDP of Malawi, where tobacco is the dominant cash drop.
Malawi subsidizes the price of gasoline and paraffin, a petroleum-derived fuel its people use for lighting and
cooking. But according to an IMF study, the government is now passing along to the population all fresh
increases in energy costs, and then some. Pump prices in Lilongwe, the capital, climbed about 19% in
October, to the equivalent of $5.16 a gallon.
"When gasoline goes up, everything goes up, so we really have to struggle to earn a living," said James
Mdachi, 43 years old, an assistant accountant for the government. He and his wife, a teacher, bring in about
$200 a month, to support three children and five other dependents.
A world away, U.S. industry has so far managed to take the oil surge in stride, although economists fret that
this may not last long. Auto makers, for instance, may have even more reason to fear high oil prices today
than they did in the late 1970s, when price shocks and gas lines tipped Detroit's auto giants into crisis. Then
and now, surging petroleum prices caught U.S. auto makers with model lineups full of powerful
rear-wheel-drive vehicles designed for an era of cheap gas.
Auto makers have more things to fret about now. Surging oil prices embolden political leaders to call for
tougher fuel-efficiency standards and other moves to discourage car use, such as fees that London and some
other big cities levy on commuters who drive into congested districts. These ideas are gaining traction
because of concern that petroleum-fueled cars and trucks exacerbate climate change. Groups worried about
global warming are finding allies in more-conservative circles whose main concern is to enhance security by
reducing reliance on oil from unstable nations.

After 20 years of largely leaving fuel-economy standards alone, the U.S. in December enacted an energy bill
that requires auto makers to boost the average efficiency of their new-vehicle fleets to 35 miles a gallon from
27.5 by 2020. Auto makers got some important concessions, such as credits for building vehicles designed to
burn ethanol and a new classification system that will make it easier for them to continue to sell larger
vehicles. But the bill marks the end of an age in which the industry was able to make vehicles heavier and
more powerful without making significant gains in fuel efficiency.
Moreover, the 2007 energy bill may not be the last auto makers hear from Washington. As part of her
presidential campaign program, Sen. Hillary Clinton has proposed a target of 55 miles per gallon for cars and
trucks by 2030.
These proposals threaten a fundamental automotive marketing strategy: Bigger is better. Industry executives,
particularly in Detroit, worry that without the freedom to market large, powerful vehicles, their businesses will
be decimated.
The fall of the Ford Explorer is emblematic of how $3-a-gallon gasoline has undermined Detroit's profit model.
In 1999, Ford sold more than 428,000 of the midsize sport-utility vehicles, at an estimated $4,000 in profit
each, and earned record profits of $7.2 billion. In 2007, through November, Ford sold just 126,930 Explorers.
Costly fuel gives a further edge to Japanese makers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. because
of their expertise in small-vehicle and small-engine design. And if more markets tilt toward small, efficient
diesel engines, as Western Europe already has, that's a plus for European companies such as Volkswagen
AG or Renault SA. or
General Motors Corp., the biggest U.S. car maker, is gambling that it can develop its own technology for
plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles fast enough to stay in the game. GM is heavily promoting its plug-in
hybrid Chevrolet Volt model, even though it isn't due to hit the market until 2010.
In the global airline industry, meanwhile, pessimists just a few years ago were predicting that some carriers
would fail if crude hit $45. The industry has proved adaptable, with airlines grounding their oldest and
thirstiest planes, raising fares and drastically reducing labor and operating expenses.
But if oil's ascent keeps pushing up jet fuel prices, travelers are sure to feel a squeeze. John Heimlich, an
economist for the Air Transport Association, predicts that if oil stays where it is or goes higher, airlines will
identify their worst-performing routes and then cut the number of flights assigned to them, substitute smaller
planes or cancel the routes.
Oil's rising cost is sure to put a sharper focus on calls to promote alternative fuels and curb burning of
carbon-based fuels. The record there so far is decidedly mixed.
Pricey oil and a quest for "energy independence" have led to an ethanol boom, but higher corn prices now
pinch that industry's profits. Historically, ethanol sold at a premium to gasoline; today there's so much ethanol
available that it's selling at a discount.
Even in abundance, ethanol is a tiny factor in the U.S. fuel market, displacing a little more than 200 million
barrels of crude oil annually, according to the Renewable Fuels Association. The blend of 85% ethanol and
15% gasoline called E85 is available at only bout 1,400 of the roughly 170,000 U.S. fuel stations. And though
ethanol is blended into most U.S. gasoline, at up to 10%, calls to dial up that percentage have sparked
controversy because of concern this might increase certain forms of air pollution.
Paradoxically, the high oil price in some ways hinders the quest to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. The oil
price makes it economic to develop unconventional deposits such as Canada's oil sands. But the gummy
substance is mined, and turning it into usable products takes extensive refining. Gallon for gallon, producing
gasoline from oil sands emits far more carbon dioxide than making it from conventional crude.
The price rise has a similarly dirty impact at power plants. In the 1990s, when natural gas was cheap, many
countries pushed to use more of that, in place of coal, to make electricity. This was good for the environment,
because per unit of energy generated, natural gas emits about half as much CO2. But natural-gas prices
roughly track oil prices, and they've been rising too. Their rise has prompted a resurgence in coal use, one
reason greenhouse-gas emissions are going up faster than many expected. China, the second-largest oil
user after the U.S., still meets the bulk of its energy needs with coal.
Oil's price run-up is fanning support for a revival of clean but controversial nuclear energy. The International
Energy Agency, an energy watchdog for the U.S. and 25 other wealthy nations, has become a big promoter
of nuclear power. Still, its latest annual outlook predicted the use of nuclear energy would grow by less than
1% annually world-wide between now and 2030, while coal usage would rise three times as fast.

The great oil boom of the 2000s has also wrought dramatic changes within the oil industry itself, which high
prices will only intensify.
Oil-rich nations, seeking to take greater command of their resources, are marginalizing the once-mighty
Western oil companies. For the first time since World War II, the future of oil and gas production isn't in the
hands of Texas-educated engineers working for U.S. companies but of executives at companies like Qatar
Petroleum and Russian behemoth OAO Gazprom. and Russian behemoth
Gone are the days when companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC had an
unmatchable combination of financial clout and technological know-how. Thanks to several years of high
prices, government-controlled oil companies have the financial muscle to bankroll their own projects.
And they have access to the latest tools for finding oil and drilling holes. During the last downturn, in the
1990s, big oil companies outsourced many of these tasks to oil-field-service companies. Now the national oil
companies can hire these service companies directly, bypassing integrated Western oil giants.
Schlumberger Ltd., the largest oilfield-service company by market value, has said its revenue from national oil
companies tripled from 2002 through 2006, while its work for Western oil companies rose just 60%. "The
growing influence of national oil and gas companies on the world energy market is abundantly evident even
to the casual observer," ConocoPhillips Chief Executive James Mulva said in March.
As the state-owned giants grow more confident and self-sufficient, they have begun to compete aggressively
for resources beyond their borders. Last year, Libya put some potentially oil-rich acreage out for bids. While
Exxon Mobil won some of it, so too did state-controlled oil companies from Russia, India and China.
More than from their bank accounts, national oil companies' strength stems from their control of resources.
Exxon Mobil, with a market capitalization of around $500 billion, is one of the largest and most successful
publicly traded companies ever. But there are 12 state-controlled oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco and
PetroChina Co., that control more oil reserves.
Driving this power shift is geology. Major new finds in North America and Europe have been rare for two
decades. Western oil companies now control only about one in 10 barrels of the world's proven reserves. As
the Western giants struggle to find fresh oil, the Aramcos of the world are only likely to rise in importance in
the years ahead.

Oil's Rise to $100: Confluence of Events Drove Crude's Ride From $10.72 --- OPEC, Iraq, Speculators
And China Fueled a Trip That May Not End Soon

Economists, Wall Street commodity traders and even seasoned energy executives were caught flat-footed by
oil's dizzying rise. Looking back, several factors came together at the same time to help oil shoot up roughly
tenfold in less than a decade and briefly touch $100. Those factors are likely to stick around -- and perhaps
push prices up further.
Western oil companies, though flush with cash, are finding fewer places to explore and drill for oil. Demand in
China and the developing world has surged far more than people anticipated a decade ago.
Adding more volatility, oil is increasingly traded as an investment by financial players with little interest in
owning the barrels. After years of internal friction, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has
been more disciplined about keeping global inventories lean and prices buoyant.
The world's ability to pump enough oil is being tested. "Demand has surged ahead, and the industry has been
playing an intense game of catch-up," says Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
Will the trends endure? Already, demand growth has slowed or stalled in some industrialized countries,
including the U.S. If the U.S. falls into a recession this year, as some economists predict, that would tend to
depress oil prices.
Nations such as China that have used subsidies to soften the blow for oil users are beginning to buckle and
pass along price increases. That could also sap demand.
Says Didier Houssin, director of oil markets and emergency preparedness at the International Energy Agency
in Paris, "The big question is, when will the demand reaction happen? We know it is coming, but what we
don't know is what price level will spark it. That is the ultimate crystal-ball question."
On the supply side, high prices are encouraging companies to take more risks and pour money into finding oil
in hard-to-reach places, such as deeper waters. In November, Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA
announced the discovery of a giant new oil field estimated to contain five billion to eight billion barrels of oil. If
that estimate is correct, it would be one of the largest finds in recent years.
But these finds take years to go from discovery to production. In the short term, financial investors who
helped drive up oil prices are likely to continue swaying markets.
The march to $100 seemed unlikely 10 years ago. A glut of oil began to form in the first few weeks of 1998.
Prices began to plunge as Western oil companies and OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela battled
for market share. The Asian financial crisis weakened Asia's crude demand. Meanwhile, that winter was one
of the warmest on record in the Northern Hemisphere, lowering demand for heating oil. OPEC nations
attempted to turn prices around by cutting production, but members cheated by pumping more than their
allotment.
On Dec. 10, 1998, crude-oil futures settled at a low point of $10.72 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The situation began to turn in early 1999. Hugo Chavez became president of Venezuela, one of the bigger
cheaters, and promised better cooperation. In March 1999, OPEC ministers agreed to cut production again.
This time, the cartel stayed in sync. Prices began to climb and closed the year above $25.
Another emerging issue was the end of easy oil. The industry had found most of its giant fields in the decades
after World War II. What was left was often in remote places with high extraction costs. Burned by price
crashes in 1986 and 1998, the industry was wary of investing too heavily in new production. Wall Street

penalized companies that were seen as overly aggressive. Big Western oil companies responded by being
disciplined with their cash.
The thirst for oil was growing steadily. Demand in the U.S., by far the world's largest consumer, grew by 2%
to 3% a year in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, demand in developing nations took off and has remained strong
despite rising prices. "The insensitivity of oil demand vis-a-vis prices has been startling," says longtime oil
observer John Olson, co-manager of Houston Energy Partners, a hedge fund affiliated with Sanders Morris
Harris Group Inc.
Mr. Houssin of the International Energy Agency attributes some of this to massive subsidies that countries
such as China, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran provide to keep domestic energy prices low. Strong
economies in most parts of the world have also muffled the impact on consumers.
Even the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused only a minor dip in global demand. By the time a U.S.-led
coalition invaded Iraq in March 2003, the world was consuming more than 79 million barrels a day, up from
73 million barrels a day five years earlier. The invasion caused a dip in supply from one of the world's biggest
oil producers. By 2004, OPEC's spare capacity, or the amount of additional oil it could deliver quickly if
needed, shrank to the lowest level in a generation.
It was also the year that China truly came onto the world energy scene. With China's economy surging, the
demand for jet fuel nationwide jumped by nearly 50%, according to the China Aviation Oil Corp., then the
country's monopoly supplier of jet fuel. Facing electricity shortages, Chinese steel mills and other factories
began sucking up diesel to power backup generators. In 2004, global demand shot up by an unexpected 2.8
million barrels a day, to 82.3 million barrels a day. Almost one-third of that growth was the result of China.
"That was the truly amazing year, and it will stand out for decades," says Roger Diwan, an analyst at the
Washington-based oil consulting firm PFC Energy.
At the same time, the oil-exporting Persian Gulf states were becoming substantial energy consumers
themselves, as petrodollars turbocharged their economies.
The oil industry was unable to lift its output in lockstep. Some of the best oil fields are in places like the Middle
East or Russia that don't necessarily welcome Western investment. Many new fields being developed are
offshore and take years to drill and connect to the pipeline grid. Also, the oil industry is in fierce competition
for cranes, steel and experienced construction crews.
While finding oil in the ground has been getting harder, it became a lot easier to buy oil on paper. The New
York Mercantile Exchange started round-the-clock electronic trading of its main crude benchmark in
September 2006, and improved access to previously restricted energy-trading markets. Financial institutions
created new vehicles for making bets on the price of oil without having to manage futures holdings.
It was the Nymex where the historic $100-a-barrel price was recorded yesterday at 12:09 p.m. EST. That was
the price in a single floor trade of the benchmark February crude-oil futures contract. A Nymex spokeswoman
said the trade was legitimate. The benchmark price settled at $99.62, up $3.64.
The ease of trading has helped attract a flood of new money. Oil markets were once dominated by physical
traders -- firms that needed to take delivery of the crude oil to run through refineries or trade with partners.
Most of the new market entrants have no interest in ever taking delivery of a barrel of oil.
The new money comes from hedge funds seeking profits in sharp oil-price moves, pension funds seeking
diversification and a hedge against inflation, and Wall Street commodity desks risking their own capital.
The number of oil-futures bets outstanding on Nymex has quintupled since 2001. Because oil has been rising
at the same time, the dollars at stake in the main oil-futures benchmark, not including options, rose from
roughly $7 billion in 2001 to more than $145 billion, calculates Ben Dell, energy analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co.
As this surge of money chased a slowly growing number of barrels, prices sprinted upwards. And with
growing demand and few easy-to-produce barrels left, the circumstances that led to yesterday's $100-a-barrel
mark seem unlikely to go away anytime soon.

Common Sense: Discipline, Patience Helped Weather Storms of 2007

I'm going to take a break this New Year's week from plunging real-estate prices, the credit crunch, the
subprime crisis, the sinking dollar . . . and find something to celebrate. I'm sure you have plenty on your own
lists, but this being Common Sense, let's look no further than 2007's columns.
So how is Common Sense feeling this New Year? Pretty darn good, notwithstanding a tumultuous, even
treacherous year in the financial markets: witness my ill-fated recommendation of now-bankrupt American
Home Mortgage on April 4.
The success of any portfolio is at least as dependent on getting the large themes right as it is on any specific
stock recommendations, and 2007 was a year where themes that have been a hallmark of Common Sense
advice all seemed to yield outsize returns.
Foremost has been my recurring advice to overweight inflation hedges, specifically raw materials and
energy; to emphasize foreign stocks, especially those in emerging markets; to maintain exposure to the
agricultural sector; and to emphasize high-quality, large-cap growth stocks like Microsoft, Intel and Oracle.
Even the health-care sector showed signs of life. And I finally feel vindicated in my advice to sell financial
stocks.
But let's zero in on 2007. The Common Sense system that aims to buy lower and sell higher worked well
again this year, yielding one opportunity to sell some shares (column of April 25) and two opportunities to buy
stocks, described in columns of Aug. 22 and Dec. 5. The selling opportunity marked a 25% gain for the
Nasdaq Composite Index from my last buying threshold, and each buying opportunity marked 10% declines
in the Nasdaq from interim peaks.
These signals didn't correlate as highly with turning points in the market as they have in previous years, when
they showed uncanny accuracy, but I've often said that the goal of this approach isn't to identify market
bottoms and tops (since that is futile).
The selling opportunity of 2515 in April proved premature, as the Nasdaq went on to an interim high of 2720
on July 19. It's too soon to know how precise the buying opportunities will turn out to be, but so far the
Nasdaq hasn't eclipsed the low of 2451 it reached on Aug. 16, nor the low of 2541 on Nov. 26, which followed
an interim high of 2859 on Oct. 31. The important thing is that readers following the Common Sense system
did indeed sell higher and buy lower in 2007.
My advice on what to buy when those opportunities appeared is also cause for celebration. My shrewdest
purchases of the year were mining companies Cia. Vale do Rio Doce and Rio Tinto, which subsequently
received an unsolicited takeover bid from BHP Billiton. Rio Tinto rebuffed the overture, arguing it undervalued
the company, and the situation remains fluid as 2008 begins. Whatever the outcome, I don't see how Rio
Tinto shareholders can lose. Since Aug. 16, Rio Doce is up a split-adjusted 71% and Rio Tinto has gained
nearly 80%.
Other stocks I bought then were Caterpillar and Deere, two stocks I first recommended on March 21, when I
suggested them as candidates for Warren Buffett's shopping list. Mr. Buffett revealed he bought a big stake in
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and has added to his holdings in Wells Fargo, among others. Mr. Buffett is a
long-term investor, and so am I, so it's premature to compare results this soon. Still, I note that since then,
Deere, Caterpillar and Burlington are all up, and Wells Fargo has suffered with the rest of the financial sector.
I remain a staunch Google investor, recommending it on Feb. 7 and again on May 23, both times when the
stock was around $470. In the latter column I concluded that Google is a "natural monopoly," destined to
reward investors with higher market share and profits for the foreseeable future. I also dismissed antitrust
objections to Google's acquisition of Internet advertising firm DoubleClick, a stand with which U.S. antitrust

authorities ultimately agreed, leaving only the European antitrust regulators threatening to derail the deal.
Despite such heightened regulatory scrutiny, Google has supercharged my portfolio now for three years
running; it ended 2007 just under $700.
This year marked my first venture into merger arbitrage, a field I usually leave to professionals. But the
Federal Trade Commission's effort to block Whole Foods Markets' acquisition of Wild Oats struck me as so
nonsensical that I couldn't resist. I first recommended Wild Oats shares and options (column of June 27) with
the stock at $16.70; I bought more when it dropped even further. Eventually Whole Foods acquired Wild Oats
at the agreed-upon price of $18.50 in cash.
It doesn't take many hits like these to outperform the broad averages, which turned in OK but hardly stellar
performances in 2007. Another way is to avoid a few of the worst disasters.
What have I learned -- or re-learned -- in 2007? That high returns are correlated with risk. That no one is right
all the time. That even the cleverest financial engineering can't turn subprime loans into triple-A credits -- or
any other dross into gold. That patience and a disciplined approach can help weather the fiercest storms.

Worries are mounting that expensive commodities will ignite long-running inflation, after last year's bull runs
in oil, agriculture and precious metals fed on each other in a global chain reaction.
Easy-to-extract deposits of metals and oil are dwindling, despite a sizable increase in exploration spending
after years of underinvestment.
A report from Barclays PLC's Barclays Capital describes the cycle: High metal prices pull up construction
costs for energy projects. High oil prices spur production of renewable fuels that can be made from crops.
Stronger demand for crops lifts grain prices and, in turn, livestock prices, because animals consume
grain-based feed.
Higher food prices and living standards push up labor costs in developing countries. Higher labor costs, in
turn, add to the expense of producing raw materials. On top of this, a flood of investor interest in commodities
continues to increase prices, including gold, which has become especially popular as a hedge against
inflation and the sinking dollar.
With oil near $100 a barrel, gold crossing $800 an ounce and wheat flirting with $10 a bushel last month
before a slight drop, there is "an awful lot of concern about the feed-through aspect of commodity prices on
inflation," said Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish.
Of the major commodities, industrial metals had some losers, such as nickel and aluminum, but other
winners. Copper fell 17% in the fourth quarter -- temporarily, some say -- amid a slowdown in U.S. home
building, yet still ended the year up 6%.
Even with a slowing U.S. economy, industrialization elsewhere in the world and stubbornly high production
costs are setting what some economists say are permanently elevated floors for many commodity prices.
Mr. Norrish estimates that mining, smelting and production costs for each new ounce of gold have risen to
$400 to $500 an ounce, close to half its $834.90 price at the end of the year. Natural-gas drilling costs have
reached $6 or $7 per million British thermal units on some North American projects, said Michael Zenker of
Barclays, roughly the same as its selling price in U.S. markets, which discourages drilling.
No one wants a repeat of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when pricey energy and raw materials helped grind
the world economy to a halt and led to the collapse that followed in many commodities markets.
Powerful oil suppliers such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are engaged in a delicate
dance to keep crude oil from reaching a price that shocks the economy and drastically changes consumption
patterns.
In their outlook for 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. energy analysts contend that current prices are far
from that threshold.
They note that the average price in 1980 for Saudi Light, a grade of crude oil that many refiners use around
the world, was $36.83 a barrel, or $92.40 adjusted for inflation. The peak that year was an inflation-adjusted
$102.50.
Last year, Saudi Light averaged less than $70 a barrel and peaked briefly at $90.12.
Although the inflation-adjusted high price in 2007 "has come within $12 of the one-touch high in 1980, the
yearly average price still stands a sizable $25-plus under its 1980 counterpart," the Lehman report said.

--- Page 119 ---
Page 119 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Lehman adds that the weakening dollar last year means that oil prices have risen less in other currencies,
and the global economy is less oil-intensive. It took nine-tenths of a barrel of crude to produce $1,000 of real
gross domestic product in 1980, compared with less than two-thirds of a barrel now.
Traders' expectations for future oil prices have risen sharply in recent months, and stayed high despite
volatility in the price of oil for immediate delivery.
The price for a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange promising delivery of oil in five years --
which reflects price expectations as well as the inconvenience of storing crude to deliver later -- continued to
trade close to its highest level ever in December, even as spot prices for immediate delivery weakened.
Oil's 57% gain on the Nymex in 2007 reflected rising pessimism about future supplies, political tensions in
oil-rich parts of the world, and investors moving money into oil futures in the face of an uncertain U.S.
economy.
There was another factor tipping Nymex oil prices to nearly $100 in November, said independent energy
economist Philip Verleger. He said the Energy Department's decision to remove a significant share of the
supply of light, sweet crude to expand the size of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve pushed the price
to $99.29 in electronic trading Nov. 21. The unrest after the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto last week contributed to another run for $100 at year end.
Mr. Verleger sees the price of oil climbing above $100 in the near term, if the DOE moves forward with a plan
to increase its stockpiling of sought-after light, sweet crude.
Many traders and economists predict more price shocks in agricultural markets in 2008, after a year of
stand-out gains. They expect demand for crop-based fuels and food by the world's growing population to
further increase competition for farm acreage. Low global stockpiles of grains and weather disruptions also
contributed to price gains in 2007. Wheat rose 77% to $8.85 a bushel and soybeans shot up 75% on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Rice hit its highest closing level ever on Dec. 28.
Corn futures gained almost 17%, but that came on top of an 81% gain in 2006 amid a large expansion in
production of corn-based ethanol. U.S. corn acreage devoted to ethanol stands at 25% of the total, up from
5% in 2001, and is expected to increase, said Dan Raab, a managing director at AIG Financial Products
Corp. who oversees the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index and other commodity-index products.
Interest in commodities as an asset class that doesn't move in tandem with stock and bond returns showed
no sign of letting up.
Even after some commodity-price increases of 50% to 100% this past year, said Mr. Raab, the "increasing
use of agricultural products in an entirely different way than what we're accustomed to is significant."
He said roughly $46 billion is invested in agricultural futures that are part of indexes tracking prices of a
basket of commodities, up from $31 billion in 2006 -- the result of price gains plus $6 billion in new
investments.
In a survey of clients at a Barclays Capital year-end commodities conference, 45% of the investors said the
agriculture sector will deliver the highest returns of all commodities this year. Only 18% and 19%,
respectively, cited energy and precious metals as 2008's standout commodity sectors.
Forecasts for industrial metals are mixed because of the looming possibility of recession in the U.S. A wave
of takeover attempts among major miners and metals producers suggests further consolidation in the sector
as it evolves into an industry of larger, integrated giants.
BHP Billiton Ltd. said its proposed acquisition of Rio Tinto PLC, announced in November, will allow it to
supply iron ore, copper, coal and other metals more efficiently.
However, after spending cash on acquisitions, companies may spend less on mining projects, which could
push prices higher.

Wall Street spent much of the year in turmoil as the underestimated risks of subprime loans haunted the
financial world. The Federal Reserve, lawmakers and central banks scrambled to ease the resulting credit
crunch. Despite declining home values, weak corporate earnings and recession fears, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average ended the year 6.4% higher.
Benazir Bhutto's assassination plunged Pakistan into deeper disarray. Hamas took over the Gaza Strip.
President Bush sent more troops to Iraq, where signs of stability appeared despite the Blackwater furor. U.S.
presidential hopefuls prepared for the 2008 race; many government and corporate officials resigned.
Here is a summary of events as chronicled on the front page of The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, the
dates are when the items were published.
January 2007
2 The Dow Jones Industrial Average begins 2007 at 12463.15, after gaining 16% in 2006, but the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market close in observance of a national day of mourning for former
President Gerald Ford. Mr. Ford, eulogized by President George W. Bush as a "rock of stability," is buried the
next day on the Grand Rapids, Mich., grounds of his presidential museum.
U.S. military deaths in Iraq since the war began in March 2003 pass 3,000, according to an Associated Press
tally. The December total of at least 113 makes it 2006's deadliest month. The U.S. death toll is 823 for 2006.
4 Home Depot Inc. Chief Executive Officer Robert Nardelli steps down with an exit package valued at about
$210 million, including $20 million in cash severance. He is succeeded by Frank Blake, the retailer's vice
chairman and executive vice president.
Federal Reserve minutes suggest some officials have doubts about inflation and the economic-expansion
outlook. Stocks fall on the news but end up 11.37 at 12474.52 in the first full trading day of 2007.
The Democrat-controlled 110th Congress convenes, ending 12 years of Republican rule. A day later, Rep.
Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is elected the first woman Speaker of the House and moves to tighten ethics rules. In
the Senate, Harry Reid (D., Nev.), is elected Majority Leader.
5 Harriet Miers resigns as White House counsel after many years at President Bush's side and a failed
Supreme Court bid. Bush aides deny any exodus of staff.
9 As Hugo Chavez begins a second six-year term as Venezuela's president, he vows to nationalize the
nation's big telecom and electricity companies, to throw out its commercial code and to strip the central bank
of its autonomy.
10 Apple Inc. introduces a media-playing cellphone, dubbed the iPhone, that lets users download and play
music, browse the Web, send emails and make calls. The device, priced up to $599 in addition to a two-year
cellular-service contract, goes on sale in late June. The price tag is high for the U.S. market, where as much
as 80% of handsets sell for $99 or less, analysts say.
11 Mr. Bush admits errors, but resolves to try to salvage Iraq. In a television address, he says the addition of
21,500 troops to secure Baghdad and Anbar offers a chance of reversing Iraq's slide.
18 A real-estate consortium unveils a $21.5 billion offer for Equity Office Properties Trust, the country's
largest office landlord, hoping to defeat an existing $20.1 billion deal with buyout firm Blackstone Group LP.
Blackstone calls the Vornado Realty Trust-led bid "inferior" to its own deal.

22 New York Sen. Hillary Clinton declares her bid for the presidency in an online posting; New Mexico Gov.
Bill Richardson follows her into the Democratic fray the next day.
24 President Bush makes Iraq and energy independence highlights of his first State of the Union address with
Democrats in control of Congress. He urges gasoline consumption be cut 20% in the next decade through
tighter vehicle-fuel standards and more ethanol. Mr. Bush defends his Iraq policy, saying defeat would have
"grievous and far-reaching" consequences and that expanding U.S. forces is the best hope of success.
26 Ford Motor Co. reports losses of $5.8 billion for the fourth quarter and $12.7 billion for 2006, the deepest
deficit in its history.
February 2007
1 Dell Inc. CEO Kevin Rollins resigns and founder Michael Dell takes the role of his former protege. The
personal-computer maker says it expects to miss fourth-quarter earnings and revenue estimates.
2 Exxon Mobil Corp. says profit rose 9.3% last year to $39.5 billion, or about $108 million a day, the largest
annual profit in U.S. corporate history. The largest public U.S. company by market value says fourth-quarter
net fell 4%.
3 Nissan Motor Co. reports a 23% decline in fiscal third-quarter earnings and predicts its first annual profit
decline in seven years. The results raise questions about whether Carlos Ghosn, who heads both the
Japanese auto maker and France's Renault SA, can effectively run two global car companies at once.
5 Vacant U.S. homes for sale climb to the highest level in four decades, stoking concerns about the housing
market. In the final three months of 2006 there were 2.1 million vacant homes for sale, bringing the rate to
2.7%. Before 2006, the rate had never broken 2%.
The Indianapolis Colts win Super Bowl XLI by defeating the Chicago Bears 29-17.
8 Blackstone Group's $23 billion buyout of Equity Office Properties, owner of the biggest portfolio of U.S.
office buildings, sends ripples through the real-estate world. The second-largest leveraged buyout cements
Blackstone's clout as one of Wall Street's most powerful investors.
HSBC Holdings PLC says its subprime- mortgage problem was worse than previously indicated. The capital it
sets aside for all bad debts will exceed estimates by $1.76 billion. The next day, shares of mortgage lenders
plunge, highlighting growing worries about losses from home-loan defaults. The combined market value of
seven U.S. lenders in the subprime market falls more than $3.7 billion.
10 Fortress Investment Group LLC's shares surge 68% in their debut to finish at $31 as the firm becomes the
first private-equity and hedge-fund manager to sell shares on U.S. markets. The five Wall Street veterans
who built the firm finish the day collectively worth more than $10 billion.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates details evidence of Iran's help in attacks on troops in Iraq. He says serial
numbers and other markings on bombs, particularly the deadly new "shaped charge" improvised explosive
devices, or IEDs, show Iranians are supplying weapons and technology, but he doesn't draw a direct link to
the Tehran government.
12 Gen. David Petraeus takes charge of U.S. forces in Iraq, becoming the third commander of the war.
13 North Korea agrees to the first tentative steps on atomic disarmament. Negotiators at six-nation talks in
China forge a plan to end Pyongyang's nuclear-weapons program in return for financial and energy
assistance worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually. For North Korea and leader Kim Jong Il, the pact
offers a way out of its harsh economic and political isolation four months after it tested a nuclear weapon; for
the U.S., the deal reflects a desire within the Bush administration for a foreign-policy victory.
15 DaimlerChrysler AG posts a 40% drop in profit and says it will cut 13,000 jobs in the U.S. and Canada,
close a plant and eliminate some slow-selling models from its product line.
20 XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. propose an $11.4 billion "merger of
equals." As the only two companies licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to offer satellite
radio in the U.S., they spend much of the rest of the year addressing antitrust concerns.
22 The Bank of Japan's decision to raise interest rates for the first time since July -- to a still very low 0.5% --
highlights the upbeat state of the world's major economies, which remain buoyant despite the effects of high
energy prices and sagging housing markets.
23 Microsoft Corp. is ordered by a federal jury to pay Alcatel-Lucent SA $1.52 billion for infringing on two
patents related to MP3 technology.

The United Nations says Iran ignores orders to halt atom work. The report by the nuclear-inspection agency
triggers a new U.S. push for further sanctions, with Russia balking. The next day, Iran says its nuclear
program will push ahead despite demands it halt uranium enrichment.
28 A decline of 9% on the Shanghai stock markets sends stocks spiraling lower around the world in a sign
investors may be re-evaluating their insatiable appetite for risky investments. The Dow industrials sink 416.02
points, or 3.3%, to 12216.24, a move exacerbated by a glitch in the mechanism calculating the blue-chip
average that results in a sudden 200-point plunge in the industrials.
March 2007
2 The Army fires the head of Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Maj. Gen. George Weightman, saying he is
the wrong person to fix embarrassing failures in the treatment of war-injured soldiers. A day later, Army
Secretary Francis Harvey quits in the wake of the scandal while the Army names Eric Schoomaker the new
commander of Walter Reed. Military officials apologize and pledge to do better.
7 Former Dick Cheney aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby is found guilty on four of five counts of perjury and
obstructing a probe of purported administration efforts to punish an Iraq war critic. The conviction ends the
Central Intelligence Agency-leak case, but not the political war. In June, Mr. Libby is sentenced to 2 1/2 years
in prison.
9 New Century Financial Corp.'s creditors force the subprime-mortgage lender to stop making loans amid
rising defaults. The move intensifies speculation the firm may have to file for Chapter 11 and underscores
how funding is vanishing for the risky loans that fueled the housing boom.
13 The Army's top medical officer resigns amid a growing scandal. Kevin Kiley, who headed Walter Reed
from 2002-04, is the third senior official to lose his job over inferior care for wounded troops.
14 Alberto Gonzales fights mounting pressure to resign as attorney general. The longtime Bush confidant
admits "mistakes were made" in replacing eight U.S. attorneys in an apparent political purge, but says while
he takes full responsibility, the decision is correct and he won't quit.
15 A California court drops all charges against former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman Patricia Dunn in the
scandal over the company's probe of boardroom leaks. The failure to obtain convictions, despite evidence of
prying into private phone records, illustrates the sketchiness of privacy protections.
The Sept. 11 mastermind has confessed, the Pentagon says. A transcript of a closed Guantanamo hearing
states Khalid Sheikh Mohammed admits overseeing the worst terror attack in U.S. history "from A to Z," as
well as many other operations, such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the foiled "shoe-bomber" plot
and the Bali bombings. He also admits killing Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The White House
declines to provide details of his statements or to specify the evidence that leads investigators to believe his
confession.
16 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. makes an unexpected $9.9 billion stock bid for Chicago Board of Trade
parent CBOT Holdings Inc. designed to thwart that firm's planned deal with rival Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Holdings Inc. designed to thwart that firm's planned deal with rival
20 ABN Amro Holding NV nears a deal to be acquired by Barclays PLC for more than $80 billion, in what
would be the largest banking deal in Europe. An accord between the British and Dutch banks would create a
global banking giant.
21 Oracle Corp. reports a 35% jump in profit and a 27% surge in revenue for its latest quarter, a sign the
company has successfully digested a string of acquisitions meant to increase its momentum in a maturing
software industry.
23 Blackstone files for an initial public offering to raise about $4 billion by selling shares in its underlying
management company, and discloses that it earned more than $6 billion in the past five years while building a
$79 billion portfolio.
April 2007
6 Kirk Kerkorian offers to buy Chrysler Group for $4.5 billion. The move by his Tracinda Corp. investment firm
comes while DaimlerChrysler AG is entertaining bids from three other potential buyers. Tracinda says it will
offer the United Auto Workers a "substantial portion" of Chrysler equity as part of a deal to cut health-care
costs. DaimlerChrysler shares jump to $84.80, a nearly eight-year high.
11 The Dow industrials rise for an eighth straight session, adding 4.71 points to 12573.85, for the longest rally
in four years.

12 NBC cancels MSNBC's simulcast of Don Imus's radio show as a flood of advertisers flee amid an outcry
over his racial remark about the Rutgers women's basketball team. The next day, CBS cancels the "Imus in
the Morning Show."
The Pentagon extends Iraq and Afghan tours of duty for all troops. All active-duty soldiers will spend 15
months instead of 12 at a time in the war zones, prompting criticism that Mr. Bush is pushing the military to
the breaking point to carry out his "surge" strategy.
13 Dow Chemical Co. fires a senior adviser and an executive vice president after learning they had been
talking to investors from Oman about purchasing the company and taking it private in a leveraged buyout.
Dow says its board hasn't authorized any such discussions by the two officials. The former officials deny
involvement.
14 The U.S. attorneys flap points to widespread erasure of emails. The White House says several million
emails may have been unintentionally deleted and denies use of Republican Party accounts rather than the
White House system was meant as a way to skirt archiving rules. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales
concedes he mishandled the dismissals of eight U.S. attorneys but says he has "nothing to hide."
16 Education lender Sallie Mae agrees to be sold to two private-investment funds and banks J.P. Morgan
Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. for $25 billion, putting the embattled company into private hands at
a time of intense political scrutiny of the student-lending industry. The buyout group includes JC Flowers &
Co. and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe LLC.
17 A Virginia Tech gunman kills 32 people in the worst shooting spree in U.S. history. The gunman, Cho
Seung-hui, kills himself as police close in. The shots set off panic at the Blacksburg campus, with students
jumping out windows to escape attacks at locations a half-mile apart.
The Wall Street Journal wins two Pulitzer Prizes for articles exposing the practice of stock-options backdating
and for reporting on China's economy.

Roberts, Alito, Scalia and Thomas is the first specific procedure outlawed since the Roe v. Wade decision.
20 Joseph Nacchio is found guilty of 19 counts of insider trading related to the former Qwest Communications
International Inc. chief executive's sale of $100.8 million in stock in 2001. In July, he is sentenced to six years
in prison.
24 Richard Scrushy reaches an $81 million deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle
claims against him related to accounting fraud at HealthSouth Corp. In June, the HealthSouth founder is
sentenced to nearly seven years in prison for bribery.

25 Toyota Motor Corp. surpasses General Motors Corp. in quarterly world-wide sales for the first time,
underscoring a seismic shift in the auto industry.
26 ABN Amro Holding NV receives a $98.58 billion takeover approach from a group led by Royal Bank of
Scotland Group PLC. The bid tops an $88.35 billion stock offer from Barclays PLC, which the Dutch bank had
accepted earlier in the week.
The Dow industrials close above 13000 for the first time, jumping 135.95 points to 13089.89 on strong
corporate profits.

arrested 172 Islamic militants plotting attacks including flying airplanes into oil facilities.
May 2007
2 Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. makes a $5 billion offer for Dow Jones & Co. The $60-a-share bid sends
Dow Jones stock surging 55% to $56.20, its highest close in nearly five years. The Bancroft family, the
company's controlling shareholders, says they would vote shares constituting slightly more than 50% of the
voting power outstanding against the offer. The family doesn't accept the offer at the outset, triggering months
of negotiations. Dow Jones's board says it won't take any immediate action. Mr. Murdoch expressed interest
in acquiring Dow Jones at a March 29 meeting with CEO Richard Zannino. News Corp. made its formal $5
billion offer in an April 17 letter to Dow Jones officials.
5 Reuters Group PLC and Thomson Corp. discuss combining in a deal that would be valued at more than
$17 billion. The deal is set about 10 days later.

7 France elects conservative Nicolas Sarkozy as president by a solid margin. Mr. Sarkozy's 53%-47% victory
over Marie-Segolene Royal paves the way for Jacques Chirac's successor to follow through on campaign
proposals to trim a bloated state bureaucracy, curb immigration and liberate business from red tape and strict
labor laws. The U.S. hails the result.
8 Alcoa Inc. offers $26.9 billion for Canadian rival Alcan Inc., escalating the commodity sector's buyout frenzy.
A World Bank panel finds that Paul Wolfowitz ran afoul of ethics rules when he used his position as president
to secure raises and promotions for his girlfriend. A week later, the World Bank's board releases a report that
warns of a "crisis of leadership" and raises strong doubts about whether Mr. Wolfowitz should continue as
president. Three days after the report, he resigns. By month's end, Mr. Bush officially nominates Robert
Zoellick as World Bank president. In late June, the World Bank board approves Mr. Zoellick as president and
he takes over July 1.
15 DaimlerChrysler AG announces it is selling an 80.1% stake in Chrysler Group to private-equity firm
Cerberus Capital Management LP for $7.4 billion, a deal that could lead to a far-reaching restructuring of
Detroit's Big Three.
19 Microsoft Corp. agrees to buy online-ad specialist aQuantive Inc. for $6 billion. The deal, the largest in
Microsoft's history, follows acquisitions of Web ad companies by Google Inc., Yahoo Inc. and others.

creating a trans-Atlantic power that will host the trading of 4,000 stocks.

1 Dell Inc. announces its first layoffs since 2001, saying it plans to cut 10% of its work force.
8 The Dow industrials plunge 198.94 points, or 1.5%, to 13266.73 as Treasurys see some of their sharpest
losses in years, pushing the yield on 10-year notes up to 5.10% amid simmering inflation jitters.
13 U.S. bond yields hit a five-year high as investors continue to sell Treasurys, with the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note rising to 5.249%. The selloff is prompted by worries about rising inflation overseas
and concern that foreigners might curb their purchases.
Palestinians teeter at the edge of civil war as hundreds of gunmen from the Islamist group Hamas overrun
Fatah's northern Gaza base, killing scores. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas orders counterblows
against what he calls a coup attempt. The next day, Hamas captures control of Gaza and ousts Fatah. A
month later, in his first major address on Middle East peace since Hamas seized control, Mr. Bush pledges to
restart the moribund peace process by pouring aid and diplomatic attention on the new government
established by Mr. Abbas after losing power in Gaza. Mr. Abbas, leader of the largely secular Fatah
movement, the main political rival to Hamas, still nominally controls the West Bank.
19 Yahoo Inc. CEO Terry Semel quits his post to become nonexecutive chairman amid mounting investor
criticism of his leadership. The technology company taps co-founder Jerry Yang to be CEO while Susan
Decker, the former finance chief, is named president.
22 Blackstone Group LP's initial public offering is priced at $31 a share, raising as much as $4.6 billion. The
private-equity firm's founders reap billions of dollars the next day, as Blackstone's IPO jumps 13%.
23 Bear Stearns Cos. agrees to lend as much as $3.2 billion to one of its two troubled hedge funds. The
move staves off the risk of a collapse of the fund, which invested heavily in subprime-mortgage bonds, and
the potential impact on the broader market.
26 Some 450,000 Chinese tires sold in the U.S. may lack an important safety feature designed to make them
more durable, regulators and the distributor say. The Chinese manufacturer says it hasn't found any safety

sale June 29. Some iPhone users also encounter difficulties trying to transfer their old cellphone numbers.
3 President Bush commutes former White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby's 2 1/2-year prison term, calling
it "excessive." Mr. Libby will have to serve two years of probation and pay a $250,000 fine. In December, Mr.
Libby drops the appeal of his conviction, a move that retains Mr. Bush's commutation, but renders him a
felon.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. files for an initial public offering as part of a strategy that would put the
private-equity firm in competition with Wall Street banks.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surges 283.86 points, or 2.1%, to a record 13861.73, its biggest gain in

14 The Dow industrials set a record for a second straight session, rising 45.52 points to 13907.52 despite a
jump in oil prices. The blue chips have their best week since April, climbing 2.2% and bringing them up nearly
12% this year. London stocks touch a level not seen since September 2000. Oil, up 21% since the year
began, climbs 2% to just below $74 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settling at an 11-month
high amid concerns about the reliability of North Sea oil production.

from a consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano SA and
Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis NV.
25 Countrywide Financial Corp. says profit slips 33%, dragged down by losses on certain types of prime
mortgage loans. Countrywide slashes its 2007 earnings forecast, citing expectations of "increasingly

August 2007
1 News Corp. seals a $5 billion accord to buy Dow Jones, ending a century of Bancroft-family ownership at

2 Mattel Inc.'s Fisher-Price unit says it will recall 967,000 toys that may contain hazardous levels of lead
paint, the latest in a spate of quality-control concerns about Chinese exports. Within a month, Mattel will
announce two additional recalls of about 19 million Chinese-made toys. Mattel later apologizes to China for
damage to the country's reputation and says its own "design flaw" was responsible for the second recall. The
moves, which heighten existing trade tensions with Washington, trigger questions about the role Western
companies should play in monitoring the complex supply chain that links them to low-cost production facilities

A bridge collapse in Minneapolis hurls dozens into the Mississippi, killing 13 people and injuring more than
100. The entire I-35W span, dating to 1967, gives way while jammed with rush-hour traffic. Washington says
structural deficiencies were found in the Minnesota span 17 years ago, but it was up to the state to remedy
them. Local officials said they had done all they realistically could.

burgeoning subprime-lending fiasco.
7 The Dow industrials surge 286.87 points, or 2.2%, to 13468.78, as investors aggressively bet ahead of the
Federal Reserve meeting. The percentage gain is the best by the blue chips in more than four years. The
next day, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledges that credit-market turmoil could hurt economic growth
but reiterates that the Fed's principal concern is inflation, even as the central bank votes to hold rates
steady at 5.25%.

10 Fallout from the credit crisis intensifies, triggering central-bank intervention and sending the Dow
industrials plunging 387.18 points to 13270.68. French bank BNP Paribas says it is freezing three funds due
to subprime-related losses. The European Central Bank and the Fed inject cash into money markets to keep
rates down. Several hedge funds say they are in the red and sell off assets. Countrywide warns market
disruptions could hurt its financial condition.
11 Central banks pump money into the financial system for a second day to ease liquidity strains. The
interventions calm markets in the U.S., but not Europe, where fears persist that banks are overexposed to
U.S. subprime loans. The Dow industrials drop 212 points at one point before recovering to finish down 31.14
at 13239.54.
13 Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney wins the Iowa Republicans' presidential straw poll as expected,

funds have seen the net value of their assets fall about $4.7 billion this year.
16 Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says turmoil in financial markets "will extract a penalty" on U.S. growth
rates. But he calls the global economy the strongest he has seen and expresses confidence that the U.S. will
avoid a recession. He says the U.S. shouldn't take action to protect market participants against risk-taking or
losses.
The Dow industrials tumble 167.45 points, or 1.29%, to close at 12861.47 and extend the previous day's

21 Short-term Treasury yields post their biggest drop in nearly 19 years as investors shrug off the Fed's
efforts to restore order to the credit markets and flee to the safest government securities. The buying pushes
the yield on three-month Treasury bills down to 3.05%.
22 A report faults Central Intelligence Agency leaders for failing to halt al Qaeda before 9/11. The review by

a plan to counter Osama bin Laden, a charge Mr. Tenet calls "flat wrong."
23 Bank of America Corp. acquires a $2 billion equity stake in Countrywide in a bid to bolster the confidence
of creditors and investors in the mortgage lender. Among other credit-crunch ripples, the four biggest U.S.
banks said they borrowed a total of $2 billion from the Fed. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. shuts its unit that
originates subprime mortgages.
27 Home Depot Inc. agrees to slash the price of its supply unit to $8.5 billion, 18% less than what had been
agreed to a few months earlier, after banks that planned to lend money to private-equity buyers balk amid the
global credit crunch.

they are arrested.
An arrest warrant is issued for Norman Hsu after the Democratic Party fund-raiser fails to appear before a
California county judge on lingering 1991 grand-theft charges, forfeiting $2 million bail. Within days, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation arrests him in Grand Junction, Colo. In December, he is indicted by a federal
grand jury on charges of running a fraudulent investment scheme and using some of the proceeds to make
political contributions. A spokesman for Mr. Hsu declines comment.
11 Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, outlines a plan to end the troop surge by next
summer, as the number of American troops there climbs to nearly 170,000. He leaves unanswered how
quickly the pullout will proceed beyond then. Gen. Petraeus later testifies the "surge" of 30,000 U.S. troops is
working better than any previous effort to quell the insurgency and restore stability.
12 Crude rises 74 cents to a record $78.23 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as uncertainty about global
supplies overshadow the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to raise output limits by
roughly 500,000 barrels a day, its first official production increase in more than two years. Oil prices briefly
top $80 a barrel for the first time the next day and finish above that benchmark by week's end.

18 The Iraqi government bans Blackwater Worldwide from working in the country following a gunbattle
between Iraqi insurgents and Blackwater security guards who were protecting a State Department convoy.
More than a dozen Iraqi civilians are killed by gunfire; Blackwater says its guards reacted to an ambush and
returned "defensive fire." The incident sparks a lengthy furor and forces Congress and Baghdad to scrutinize
how security contractors operate in Iraq. The uproar escalates through autumn, with a Blackwater
advisory-board member whose brother is a top State Department official resigning in November amid
criticism from Democrats. By year's end, a pact between the Pentagon and State Department tightens U.S.
military control over Blackwater and other security firms in Iraq.
19 The Fed cuts the federal-funds rate, the benchmark target rate for overnight lending between banks, by
half a percentage point to 4.75%, exceeding the expected quarter-point cut most economists had expected.

to hit the auto maker since 1998. Production at GM's more than 80 facilities shuts down, idling 73,000
workers. Within days, GM and the UAW reach a tentative pact that covers about 74,000 U.S. workers. The
UAW trades company-provided retiree health care and a longstanding insistence on equal pay for all workers
in return for GM commitments to invest in plants and fund $29.9 billion for a new health-care trust. The pact
also sets up a mechanism for GM to buy out thousands of workers.
26 Myanmar's military leaders impose a curfew and ban gatherings of more than five people after 35,000
Buddhist monks and their supporters stage protests demanding an end to military rule. In the following days,
security forces open fire on the protesters. The government says 10 people are killed in the crackdown;
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says the loss of life is "far greater." Mr. Bush announces sanctions
against the regime.

next day, Barclays Group PLC formally withdraws its bid for ABN Amro.
Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto forge an agreement
designed to let them shepherd the nation from military rule to civilian government. The pact would let Ms.
Bhutto return to Pakistan to run for prime minister. The next day, Pakistan's Supreme Court throws the
country into political confusion that will last weeks. The court says a scheduled presidential vote can go
ahead but that results won't be official until it decides whether Mr. Musharraf is eligible to stand for re-election
while retaining his army-chief post.
11 Chrysler LLC and the United Auto Workers agree to a tentative labor deal hours after workers go on strike.
The pact includes the creation of a health-care trust fund. General Motors Corp.'s unionized workers ratify a

Commission scrutinizes the adequacy of the firm's disclosures to investors about an $8.4 billion write-down
that fueled Mr. O'Neal's ouster.

December 2007
1 Civilian killings in Iraq fall to the lowest level in nearly two years. The number of deaths decline 29% in
November from October and are down nearly 75% from early this year, before U.S. forces launched a troop
surge. Later in the month, a U.S. general says violence in Iraq has fallen to the lowest level since the first
year of war. Iraqi forces take control of half the country as Britain hands over security in the last region under
its control.

homes starting foreclosure has jumped; late mortgage payments hit a 21-year high.
The CIA says it destroyed videotaped interrogations of terror suspects. Agency Director Michael Hayden says
the two tapes, made in 2002 as part of an internal check, are destroyed out of fear they would be leaked to

secret detention program.
11 UBS announces write-downs of $10 billion, becoming one of the biggest casualties of the U.S.

infusion from Singapore's investment arm and a Middle Eastern investor.
12 The Fed cuts interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 4.25%, the third reduction since August, and
leaves the door open to further cuts. In response, the Dow industrials plunge 294.26 points, or 2.1%, to
13432.77, as many investors hoped for a half-point cut.
14 Citigroup bails out seven affiliated structured-investment vehicles, or SIVs, bringing $49 billion in assets
onto its balance sheet and further denting its capital base. The move may signal the death knell of an

bailout effectively kills one of the centerpieces of the administration's approach to calm homeowners and
markets.

The Clinton Housing Bubble

The joint housing and mortgage-market crisis once again reminds us that all financial implosions stem from
the same cause: borrowing short and lending long without enough equity to weather periodic storms in the
gap between.
But this bubble was different. Besides being fueled by housing purchases and repackaged loans, each with
inadequate equity -- doubling down with other people's money -- at the end of the capital-gains rainbow was
the right to take up to $500,000 of profit, tax free.
Thank you President Bill Clinton for your 1997 action, applauded by the banks, the realtors and all citizens in
search of half-millionaire status from an investment they could understand and self deceptively believe to be
low risk; thank you for fueling the mother of all housing bubbles; thank you for enabling so many of us who
bought second or third homes, and homes before construction began, which we then sold to someone else
who dreamed of riches from owning homes long enough to sell to another fool.
Once again, try as we might and in spite of our political rhetoric, we have failed to help the poor in applauding
government action intended to help ourselves.
The consumption binge is now over, and there is more than enough blame and souring loans to spread
around. Congress, if its members can stop squabbling, wants desperately to sanctify it all with actions sure to
launch at some future date the grandmother of all housing and mortgage-market bubbles. This august body
has long forgotten that it set the stage for housing bubbles by creating those implicitly taxpayer-backed
agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as housing lenders of last resort.
Financial market innovators who invented securitization as a mechanism for creating a liquid national market
for mortgages are now criticized for having caused an "agency problem." This is jargon for management not
having good incentives to provide investors with "truth in packaging" of the underlying economic risk. But
what does truth matter at the height of a bubble? These critics would solve the agency problem with more
government regulation. Excuse me, but does not the political process have the biggest agency problem of
all?
The Federal Reserve, with a default-risk tiger by the tail, feels handcuffed by its accountability and
responsibility for avoiding a cascade of defaults in the highest quality obligations, as well as the bad
investments seeking an asymmetric tax-free profit. Shades of Long Term Capital, the Savings and Loan
crisis, and heyday of the myth of Portfolio Insurance -- historical cases of borrowing short to lend for what
may turn out to be longer than expected. They are all conditioned on the existence of liquidity for sellers that
can dry up with frightening speed.
Consequently we have the "independent" Fed being driven by market forces to accommodate the
long-evident and glaringly least-defensible features of the housing/mortgage markets. Moreover, the moment
the Fed abandoned its stance against inflation, the dollar, gold, oil and commodity prices signaled inflation,
and now two months later consumer prices have confirmed the signal.
More daring than the action to exempt real estate from the capital gains tax -- and in lasting service to the
poor -- would have been actions allowing capital gains on all assets to go tax free, provided that the capital
was reinvested -- i.e., not consumed, and yes, good citizens, housing counts as consumption.
Unlike the latest housing bubble, the stock market "excesses" of the 1990s financed thousands of new
ventures, some of which found innovative ways to manage the proliferation of new technologies. The result:
astonishing, long-term increases in productivity still evident in the most recent quarter.
Adam Smith in his "The Theory of Moral Sentiments" (1759) saw the subtle truth that consumption by the rich
has little effect on the welfare of the poor. That's because the income of the rich is largely invested in the tools
and knowledge of production, which provide future long-term value for everyone: "The rich only select from

the heap what is most precious and agreeable . . . though they mean only their own conveniency . . . [and] . . .
the gratification of their own vain and insatiable desires, they divide with the poor the produce of all their
improvements."
Expenditures on housing construction are not "improvements" yielding increased productivity and future new
wealth to be divided with the poor. They are more akin to satisfying government-subsidized vanity.

Your editorial in praise of Harvard's "generosity" ("Crimson in Clover," Review &Outlook, Dec. 13) by devoting
about $120 million more each year toward helping students afford its tuition and other expenses reveals one
good and one bad fact. On the positive side, universities are beginning to notice that we -- parents of college
kids -- are fed up with soaring student costs while the universities' endowment funds grow larger that the
GNP of some countries. On the negative side, these initiatives are trivial in comparison with what the schools
can actually afford to spend to help their students.
Harvard's endowment fund takes in about $3 billion of new money each year. The ballyhooed $120 million
being added to student aid is exactly 4% of what the fund receives each year. If you are surprised, consider
that the aggregate annual payments made to Harvard by all students at every level of its academic pyramid
are, according to its own numbers, about $1.5 billion. This is half the endowment fund's growth each year. In
plain English, Harvard could give a free education to every student and still pocket $1.5 billion in new money
every year.
So, thanks a lot, Harvard, for nothing.

While the federal government complains of the cost of higher education, as the editorial "Crimson and Clover"
points out, they are themselves to blame. If they really wanted to control the cost, they would stop interfering
with higher education by means of accreditation and assessment red tape. The expensive bureaucracy
created within each university to deal with the accreditation bodies and the Department of Education is driving
up the cost of tuition and sending higher education down the same bad road as K-12.

I first became aware of the relationship between federal student aid and rising tuition when I was a student
leader in college ("Harvard for Free" by Fay Vincent, op-ed, Dec. 13). In an informal, private conversation
about the future of the college with a senior administrator in the late 1970s, he told me that a coming increase
in federal student aid would allow the college to raise tuition and fees much more freely than in the past. He
clearly welcomed the anticipated increase in the college's revenue. I didn't think the increase could be all that
significant, and in any event, I was about to graduate. But as a parent today, I marvel at how much more
expensive college is now than it was three decades ago.

payer is the parent, usually a middle-aged person who has had to draw down retirement investments to pay
for Susie's years in college. Don't forget that Susie has at least one sibling who also needs years in college.
When dad or mom is forced to deplete retirement funds, the hit comes just when those investments are
(finally) achieving some critical mass. Should the parent's savings and investments be too thin to foot the cost
of college, then that parent goes into debt at a time when new indebtedness also threatens to derail
retirement.
Ten years from now, when costs have once again doubled again, the parents of every middle-class student
will face the dreary truth that they are doomed to work until they die.

While I fully agree with Mr. Vincent's comments regarding reduced (or free) tuition for students regardless of
need, I have to say that there is a competitive element that will likely always exist. Namely, no matter what
the nation's best universities charge, I, and many people I know -- of all economic classes -- will do whatever
it takes to pay the fee should my kids get in. As my father always said, "Integrity and education can never be
taken away from you." Ivies, for the record, Annabel starts in September 2019 and Sophie in 2023.

In the late 1960s while at Harvard Law School, the radical left Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)
published a pamphlet showing how Harvard could waive all tuition charges if it would use its endowment
earnings instead of salting it away. And now we read the same thing on the op-ed page of the Journal.
SDS meets WSJ, almost 40 years later. I am not sure what this proves.

Rice Prices Are Steaming, With Many Implications --- Developing World Is Vulnerable To Expected Food-Cost Inflation; Hedge Funds Get Into...
Rice Prices Are Steaming, With Many Implications --- Developing World Is Vulnerable To Expected
Food-Cost Inflation; Hedge Funds Get Into the Act

The global commodities boom that has lifted prices of everything from gasoline to gold is now elevating rice
-- a staple food for half of the world -- to its highest level in nearly 20 years.
Rice's surge has complex consequences for the global economy. Used in everything from sushi to burritos to
Rice Krispies, the ubiquitous grain is suffering poor harvests and tight supplies in some of the biggest
rice-exporting and rice-consuming nations, just as demand grows in places like India and the Philippines.
The higher price is a boon for some farmers and investors. But at the same time, it is expected to contribute
to a protracted bout of food-price inflation for the foreseeable future, which could widen the rift between the
world's haves and have-nots.
"At the end of the day, the fight will be between the industrialized world and the developing world," says
Michael Lewis, managing director at Deutsche Bank.
A particular humanitarian concern is that the world's poorest consumers, many dependent on rice, often have
little or no voice. "When they suffer food shortages, they starve in silence," says Joachim von Braun, director
general at the International Food Policy Research Institute.
Soaring prices are drawing myriad investors into the market. On the Chicago Board of Trade, the number of
bets outstanding on rice futures contracts recently reached a high -- a basic sign that more traders see a
chance to make money on rising prices.
Nontraditional players, such as hedge funds, are now trading in rice, according to Fred Seamon, associate
director of commodity research at the CBOT, and new exchange-traded investment products aimed at
individual investors are also being rolled out. Two months ago, Jim Rogers, founder of the Rogers
International Commodities Index, launched the Rogers Agricultural Exchange Traded Note.
While prices for other commodities like oil have been flirting with records in recent months, in
inflation-adjusted terms, agriculture commodities still have room to rise before reaching that point. For
example, the price of wheat will have to increase by 106% before it reaches its record high in real terms,
according to Mr. Lewis at Deutsche Bank.
As rice prices rise, food aid for developing countries is becoming scarcer. And the international price for
broken rice, an affordable grade favored in many African countries, has increased 40% since last year,
according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
On the CBOT Friday, rice futures contracts settled at $13.1250 per 100 pounds, down 5.5 cents. That is up
from $9.87 a year ago and just shy of the previous record price of $13.40, set in January 1988 when rice was
traded at the Mid-America Exchange.
While prices like these aren't at record levels in inflation-adjusted terms, they nevertheless threaten to
exacerbate poverty in large areas of the world.
One risk is that, in some cases, rising prices lead to food shortages and social unrest. Indeed, in November a
riot that broke out in Senegal was in part attributed to higher prices for rice, a staple there. Protesters,
throwing rocks and burning tires, were met with police firing tear gas.
The story of rice echoes that of nearly all commodities, whether petroleum, copper or wheat. Prices for many
commodities are surging thanks to booming demand from emerging economies like China. It is having broad
ripple effects: Steel prices make it costlier to construct buildings; the rising cost of oil helps to drive up the
cost of world shipping rates.

--- Page 139 ---

Rising oil prices also make it costlier to grow and ship rice and other grains -- which, in turn, drives up food
prices.
Agricultural commodities, of course, tend to have a more direct human impact than, say, oil or steel. Grains
have been trading at or near historic highs partly because of a combination of growing demand for biofuels --
such as ethanol made from grain -- as well as a rising global population, which means more mouths to feed in
the developing world.
In addition, the weaker dollar has helped to boost global rice prices, as most rice is traded in dollars. In
Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, the price of long-grain rice has increased nearly 20% since last
year, according to Nathan Childs, senior economist at the Department of Agriculture.
All these factors have depleted global grain stocks to levels not seen in decades. Wheat stocks are at their
lowest level in 60 years. Rice stocks are at 24-year lows.
Complicating matters: Historically, rice has been a thinly traded market. Only about 7% of global rice
production is traded on the world market, according to Mr. Childs. This means that, in the event of a supply
shock, rice importers have to scour the globe for available supplies, driving up the price even further. For
comparison, about 16% of other grains, like wheat and corn, are traded globally.
Increased demand and tightening supplies are likely to persist. The Agriculture Department estimates that
food prices will increase about 4.5% this year over last, compared with a 2.4% annual increase last year. In
the developing world, food prices have increased about 9% over last year, according to the International
Monetary Fund.
Higher food costs tend to hit people in poor countries harder than those in developed countries as
households in developing countries spend a larger percentage of their income on food. In the U.S., food
makes up about 18% of the overall consumer-price-index basket, compared with as much as 40% in some
emerging economies, according to a report by Deutsche Bank.
For countries that rely on donations or aid to feed the hungry, higher prices can mean less food. At the United
Nations World Food Program, rice is the third-most-frequently purchased commodity, and it supplies more
than 70% of caloric intake in poor countries like Cambodia.
"If prices go up we'll be getting less of that particular commodity," says WFP spokeswoman Jennifer
Parmelee. She says the price of procuring food has increased 50% over the past five years.
Since 2000, global rice consumption has increased 7.5%, while production increased about 5.4%. As
supplies run short, the risk for the world market is that big rice exporters start keeping the food for themselves
rather than selling it on the market, further driving up prices.
In July, Vietnam -- the world's second-largest rice exporter after Thailand -- said it would restrict rice exports
in order to meet domestic needs first. India, another large exporter, announced similar export restrictions in
October.
The U.S. accounts for only about 1.5% to 2% of global rice production, but it is the fourth-largest exporter,
behind Thailand, Vietnam and India.
This year, U.S. rice acreage was 3% smaller than last year because of strong prices for competing crops, like
corn and soybeans. However the crop is estimated to be 2% bigger because of higher yields. U.S. exports
are expected to be nearly 20% higher than last year.

Crude Heads Back to $100 --- Oil Prices Surge On Expectations For Higher Demand

Crude Heads Back to $100 --- Oil Prices Surge On Expectations For Higher Demand

Crude-oil futures delivered their largest percentage gain in nearly 11 months yesterday as a confluence of
factors appeared to put the market back on the path to test $100-a-barrel oil.
Light, sweet crude for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $4.37, or 4.9%, to $94.39
a barrel, the highest settlement for a front-month contract since Nov. 27 and the highest percentage gain
since Jan 30. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange rose $4.03, or 4.5%, to settle at $94.02 a barrel.
A big factor fueling the rally was news that the Federal Reserve had coordinated with several other central
banks to supply additional loans to banks, accepting an array of assets as collateral from subprime
mortgages to credit card receivables.
Coming a day after the Fed cut its key rate for the third time this year, the Fed's move to increase liquidity
cheered players who saw it as a sign financial markets would slough off worries of a potential global
economic slowdown. An improved economic outlook would continue to boost energy demand.
"It looks like the Federal Reserve, with their interest rate cut yesterday and their decision to pump up liquidity
is trying to forestall a future slowdown," said Gene McGillian, an analyst at TFS Energy Futures in Stamford,
Conn. "That is telling us the demand for energy is going to be robust going forward."
Lehman Brothers energy analyst James Crandell noted that the entire commodities complex rose on the Fed
news yesterday. Natural gas rose 4.6%, gold rose 2.3%, and agricultural commodities from wheat to corn
scored gains. "Many explanations surfaced for the commodity rise; however, the headline that interested us
most concerned the Fed," he said. Since global oil demand growth remains strong despite a slowdown in
consumption in the West, the Fed's financial stimulus spurred investment.
An oil spill at a North Sea oil platform reminded traders that the petroleum supply remains vulnerable to
disruption.
Oil has fallen sharply in the last few weeks, after surging toward the psychologically key $100 level twice in
November.
Oil inventory figures released yesterday by the Energy Information Administration showed crude stocks
declined unexpectedly by 700,000 barrels in the week ended Dec. 7. But it was a surprise 800,000-barrel fall
in distillates, which include heating oil and diesel, that underpinned bullish sentiment, traders said. Stocks of
distillates are now 6.9% below last year's levels, the EIA said.
Goldman Sachs Group also gave energy futures a head start when the investment bank raised its forecast for
the average oil price and said it expected prices to hit $105 a barrel by the end of next year. That moved
speculative money off the sidelines.
"A lot of new money comes into the marketplace when these guys talk," said Tony Rosado, a broker at IAG
Energy Brokers in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
Front-month January reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, rose 12.14 cents, or 5.3%, to $2.4128 a
gallon, the highest settlement for a front-month contract since Nov. 26. January heating oil rose 12.02 cents,
or 4.8%, to $2.6432 a gallon, the highest since Nov. 27.
Global economic health ranks top among analysts forecasting oil prices in the 12 months ahead. Because of
fears of a slowdown, some analysts think 2008's oil market may be less robust than 2007.
"The high we see in 2007 is the high we will see in 2008," predicts Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in
Chicago.

On average, analysts expect benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude will trade at $72.80 a barrel next
year, a Thomson Financial poll shows. In a separate forecast Tuesday, the EIA said crude would jump 18%
to average $84.83 a barrel in 2008, after a 9.1% jump this year to $72.05. Both are less than oil's all-time
intraday record high of $99.29 a barrel, hit Nov. 21.
In other commodity markets:
NATURAL GAS: Futures surged ahead of a winter storm in the Northeast expected to boost heating demand
and traders bought back previously sold positions to get ahead of rising prices. Natural gas for January
delivery rose 32.3 cents, or 4.6%, to $7.408 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
WHEAT: Prices jumped, with nearby Kansas City Board of Trade and Minneapolis Grain Exchange contracts
setting new highs, supported by speculatitive buying and ideas U.S. wheat acreage might not be as high as
thought. December KCBT wheat rose 30 cents to $9.79 a bushel. December MGE wheat also rose 30 cents,
to $10.85.

Harvard University got some nice press this week by announcing it will reduce tuition for middle-class
families. It already allows students whose parents earn less than $60,000 a year to attend Harvard free. Now
it promises that families making up to $180,000 will pay no more than 10% of their annual income to finance
the $45,600 that a year in Cambridge now costs.
Drew Gilpin Faust, the school's new president, said the policy is designed to help families facing "increasing
pressures as middle-class lives have become more stressed." Before applauding Harvard's altruism too
loudly, however, readers should know that the school also had its back against a wall. In September,
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley held hearings on whether colleges should be forced to spend a higher
percentage of their endowments each year.
While private foundations have been required for decades to shell out 5% of their total assets annually,
universities decide for themselves and average close to 4%. The difference may seem small, but the money
at stake is very large. Harvard's endowment is $35 billion, and growing, with implications that Fay Vincent
illuminates nearby. Mr. Grassley wants to know why rich schools don't spend more of their money to reduce
ballooning tuition.
When the hearings began, Kevin Casey, the senior director of federal and state relations at Harvard, told the
Crimson student newspaper that "it may not be the best thing for Congress to dictate the formulas by which
financial aid and endowment spend-out should be connected." Mr. Casey is right. But given the hundreds of
millions of dollars that the university receives from the government each year, Senators inevitably start to
think that Harvard's business is their business.
Ironically, these government handouts are creating the tuition problem. Tuition has risen about three
percentage points faster than inflation every year for the past quarter-century. At the same time, the feds
have put more and more money behind student loans and other financial aid. The government is slowly
becoming a third-party tuition payer, with all the price distortions one would expect. Every time tuition rises,
the government makes up the difference; colleges thus cheerfully raise tuition (and budgets), knowing the
government will step in.
As a result, "colleges have little incentive to cut costs," says economist Richard Vedder, the author of "Going
Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much." Mr. Vedder explains that there are now twice as many
university administrators per student as there were in the 1970s. Faculty members are paid more to teach
fewer hours, and colleges have turned their campuses into "country clubs." Princeton's new $136 million
dorm, according to BusinessWeek, has "triple-glazed mahogany casement windows made of leaded glass"
and "the dining hall boasts a 35-foot ceiling gabled in oak and a 'state of the art servery,'" whatever a servery
is.
Our financial-aid system also hurts middle-class applicants. Parents who have saved money for their child's
tuition quickly find that, by the strange calculus of financial aid, they are charged more for college tuition than
if they had blown their savings on a bigger house. Mr. Vedder wonders why universities should get to ask the
income of their students before telling them how much they'll be charged. That sounds like price
discrimination: If a car dealer tried to make you fill out the form students have to fill out for financial aid, he
notes, "you'd run to a consumer protection agency."
So is college still worth it? Though academic standards have certainly fallen, college graduates still, on
average, make about twice as much over the course of their lifetimes as people with only a high school
diploma. So if the government got out of the higher education business, a lot of families might decide to make
the sacrifice anyway, even without the tuition aid. But they might also decide that they can live without the
mahogany windows.

Crude Tops $90 a Barrel --- Midwest Ice Storm, Interest-Rate Cut Boost Futures 2.5%

Crude Tops $90 a Barrel --- Midwest Ice Storm, Interest-Rate Cut Boost Futures 2.5%

Crude-oil futures rose above $90 a barrel as an ice storm stopped crude's flow through key U.S. oil pipelines
and after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, leaving the door open for more cuts.
Light, sweet crude for January delivery settled up $2.16, or 2.5%, at $90.02 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Prices fell below $90 a barrel in late electronic trading, as flow through the pipelines began to
return. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange settled $1.95 higher at $89.99 a barrel.
The Fed's quarter-percentage point interest-rate cut was in line with expectations and unable to drag crude
out of the trading range between $85.82 and $90.73 a barrel where it has been stuck all month. The rate cut
is seen by some as capable of aiding crude demand and also is seen as being a drag on the dollar. The U.S.
currency had a mixed reaction to the cut, weakening against the yen and strengthening against the euro.
Dollar weakness has been a big factor in crude's recent run-up to nearly $100 a barrel, increasing the
spending power of traders using other currencies and blunting the potential demand erosion of higher
dollar-denominated oil prices.
"The oil market knew the Fed was going to cut and rallied early on that," said Tony Rosado of IAG Energy
Brokers in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "Still, it's struggling to go higher, and much will depend on [weekly U.S.
inventory] statistics."
A power outage in Oklahoma after an ice storm suspended operations at major Midwestern pipelines,
including three leading in and out of Cushing, Okla., the nation's largest oil-storage hub and the delivery point
for Nymex crude-oil futures. It was originally feared that the pipelines could be out for more than a week, but
one had already restarted and the other three were getting ready to restart yesterday afternoon.
"Today's rise is still associated with the Cushing problems, but it is just a distribution issue [rather than any
change to supply]. I'm a little perplexed when it rallies on this sort of thing," said Kyle Cooper, director of
research at IAF Energy Advisors in Houston.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices of gold futures were mildly higher ahead of the Fed's interest-rate cut. The nearby December
gold contract rose $3.70, or 0.5%, to $811.40 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. After news of
the rate cut, prices fell in the thinly traded electronic session.
SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose as U.S. Agriculture Department
data supported the strong-demand thesis that has been boosting prices in recent days. The USDA raised its
soybean export and crush estimates because of strong demand for the oilseed, which reduced the ending
stocks, or surplus supplies, of the crop as a result. January soybeans gained 9.75 cents to settle at $11.3550
a bushel.

Doha Pursues the 2016 Olympics

Doha Pursues the 2016 Olympics

When Doha launched its bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics on Oct. 25, with a sound and light show on the
Corniche overlooking the Persian Gulf, the world responded with a mighty O-h-h-h? Tokyo, Chicago, Madrid,
Prague, Rio de Janeiro and . . . the mouse that roared?
But to those of us who chanced to be in Doha, Qatar, in December 2006 for the 15th Asian Games -- the
second largest sporting event after the Olympics, attended by 8,060 athletes and 4,100 team officials from 45
countries representing more than half of mankind -- the bid came as no surprise.
When I met with the energetic 36-year-old secretary-general of the Qatar Olympic Committee, His
Excellency, Sheik Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, a distant cousin of the royal family and a New Mexico
State graduate in engineering, he walked me through the rationale for hosting the Asian Games: (1) to put
Qatar -- with the world's third-largest natural gas reserves, but with low international profile -- "on the map";
(2) to increase tourism by establishing an annual circuit of international sporting events in Qatar; and (3) to
instill discipline in Qatar's young people by providing facilities to enable them to participate in sports. An
Olympics in Qatar was a key ingredient in that vision, he added. Preparations had been in the works since
2004.
Qatar, the sheik told me, had put up $3.8 billion to build a state-of-the-art sports facility and to import some
25,000 foreigners to run the Doha Asian Games. What he didn't say, but numerous expatriates did, is that the
reason so many foreigners were needed is that Qataris, for whom the good life has come easily, are not used
to hard work. In any case, there weren't enough of them with the skills to do the job.
To the standard 28-event Olympic menu, the Doha Asian Games added 11 events, including kabaddi, a
centuries-old Indian village tag game played barefoot, which is also popular in Pakistan and Bangladesh. You
could learn as much about Qatar and its Olympic pretensions from the gold-medal match between India (35)
and Pakistan (23) as you could about kabaddi itself. Although some 750,000 people live in Qatar -- a
peninsula-state about the size of New Jersey jutting into the Persian Gulf from Saudi Arabia -- only 170,000
are its citizens. The balance are Indians (the majority) -- numbering more than 200,000 -- Pakistanis,
Filipinos, Iranians, Bangladeshis and a host of other groups who come to Qatar in search of work and
sometimes end up staying the rest of their lives. As at most events, very few Qataris were seen at the
kabaddi hall, whose seats were filled mainly by the immigrants who do the work that keeps Qatar running.
The Doha Games were executed almost flawlessly. Chinese gold medal weightlifter Li Hongli was among the
many athletes I spoke to who felt that the accommodations, the food and the competition facilities reached
the highest standards. The complex transportation system to the venues, the media services, and the
computerized information system all functioned seamlessly.
And in the most memorable moment of the superb Opening Ceremony -- which lavishly traced the history of
Qatar from antiquity until today -- the captain of the Qatar equestrian team, Mohamed bin Hamad Al-Thani,
the son of the Emir, galloped up a specially constructed ramp to the top of Khalifa Stadium to light the Asian
Games' eternal flame. The Closing Ceremony, following the theme of "A Thousand and One Nights," raised
the bar for future Olympic closing ceremonies.
Perfection . . . But a catering company from England fed the Athletes' and Media Villages, a Dutch company
ran the lnfo2006 system and Asian Games News Service, foreigners handled the accreditation, did the
announcing at the competitions, and managed and operated the transportation system. Foreigners ran the
Athletes' and Media Villages, as well as the scoreboards, the media centers, and the TV camerawork.
Foreign janitors did the cleanup. And the 16,000 volunteers who complemented the paid staff were drawn
overwhelmingly from Qatar's immigrant communities. Seven hundred Australians put together the Opening
Ceremony program; even the horse at the Opening Ceremony was trained in Australia. Only in the security
detail was there any identifiable Qatari presence. A simple "Keif halaq" ("How are you?") addressed in Arabic

--- Page 148 ---
Page 148 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
to a Doha Asian Games worker almost always brought a blank response. The Opening and Closing
Ceremonies aside, there was little of the flavor of Arabia at the Doha Games. Qatar simply gave the
go-ahead and wrote the checks.
To escalate from an Olympic Applicant City to a Candidate City, Doha must answer by Jan. 14, 2008, 25
questions posed by the IOC dealing with motivation and legacy, political support, finances, venues,
accommodations, transportation, and security. The IOC Executive Board will use this application to determine
next June if Doha is qualified to be one of the finalists. If chosen, Doha will prepare an elaborate "bid book."
The 2016 host city will be announced in October 2009.
With the support of the royal family, Doha will have no difficulty satisfying the economic requirements. A price
tag of $20 billion (Beijing's round-figure investment) was within budget, Sheikh Saoud said.
Where Doha will fall far short of the current host, Beijing 2008, is in popular participation, in what the IOC
calls "sustainability," and in the legacy an Olympic Games in Doha will leave behind. Beijing has made a
maximum effort to use local resources and, in the process, is learning the ways of the world. Its tourist
services, its translators, its caterers, its computer technicians, its TV cameramen will all be better for the
experience. Doha, on the other hand, would bring in almost everything from outside the country. Its
thousands of mostly expat volunteers could never match Beijing's 70,000. At the end of a Doha Olympic
Games, most of the imported skills will leave with the contractors.
Already, the writing is on the wall. When you click on the Media Centre tab at www.doha2016.org , up pop
two contacts from the international image maker, Burson Marsteller. In Beijing, at the same stage in the
application process, the public face was Chinese.
But the big unanswerable questionabout Doha's 2016 bid is "What after?" For the 2006 Asian Games, Qatar
had 7,000 hotel rooms to accommodate 20,000 visitors. Beijing 2008 will offer more than 100,000 hotel
rooms. After the Beijing Games, China will still have the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the Temple of
Heaven to attract tourists to those rooms; Qatar only sea, sun and sand.
On balance, hosting the 2016 Olympics would be a tremendous boon for Qatar, well satisfying Doha 2016's
bid slogan: "Celebrating change." At the extreme, it might force Qatar to deliberate whether a country whose
citizens are a 20% minority can be viable. In time, this might force liberalization of Qatar's naturalization laws
and, by example, influence other Persian Gulf ministates.
In analyzing Doha's 2016 bid, the International Olympic Committee needs to answer two essential questions:
Is nation-building on the agenda of the IOC? Are the Olympic Games up for sale?
If the answer to these is "yes," Doha 2016 would put on a whale of a show.

Gold, as Hedge to Dollar, Soars

Gold futures surged as the U.S. dollar slipped and speculators bought ahead of an anticipated Federal
Reserve interest-rate cut today, analysts said.
Technical chart-based trading also supported the metal.
The nearby December gold contract rose $13.30, or 1.7%, to settle at $807.70 an ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most-active February gold contract rose $13.30, or 1.7%,
to $813.50.
"Precious metals strengthened today, as the greenback lost ground," a BNP Paribas research note said.
"Gold built steadily on gains in Asia until the commencement of Comex trade, when it shot higher. Fund
buying and chart-based support [were] evident."
The price of gold often moves in tandem with the euro and inversely with the dollar because gold is viewed
as an alternative currency and hedge against the moves of the dollar.
Gold was "exceedingly strong" as the dollar was lower, said Leonard Kaplan, president of Prospector Asset
Management. However, Mr. Kaplan said it was surprising that gold moved up so much as oil fell and the
Federal Open Market Committee meeting is today. Normally, traders would be waiting to see what the
Federal Reserve will do about interest rates, he said. Trading volume was low, "and the funds are very
active," Mr. Kaplan said.
Most participants in the market are expecting at least a quarter percentage-point cut, said Patrick Lafferty,
commodity trading adviser with MF Global. He added that a lower dollar supported gold as the metal
continued to bounce off support from last week. Gold has bounced from around the $780 level, and now the
path of least resistance is upward until around $830, Mr. Lafferty said. "It should be clear up to that," he said.
In other commodity markets:
WHEAT: Prices rose but settled off all-time highs at the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange. Follow-through buying slowed after prices climbed to the highs and profit-taking moved in,
analysts said. December wheat at the MPLS rose 11 cents a bushel to $10.54, just off the all-time high of
$10.67. December KCBT also rose 11 cents, to $9.60, just off the high of $9.77.
CRUDE OIL: Futures ended slightly lower as expectations of growing U.S. crude-oil and refined-product
inventories blocked an intraday run at $90. Light, sweet crude stayed range-bound, with the January contract
falling 42 cents, or 0.5%, to $87.86 a barrel on the Nymex.
EXCHANGES: Malaysia's stock-exchange operator, Bursa Malaysia Bhd., is in preliminary talks with CME
Group's Chicago Mercantile Exchange on potential collaborations. Bursa said it continuously looks at
opportunities to work "with strategic business partners to assist the growth of its businesses," which may
involve equity holding.

Corrections &Amplifications
A chart with Friday's page-one article about the Bush administration's mortgage-relief plan illustrated the ratio
of median home-sale price to median household income, not the ratio of median household income to median
sale price as was incorrectly indicated.
(WSJ Dec. 10, 2007)
(END)
WASHINGTON -- In unveiling a plan to help more than one million struggling homeowners, the Bush
administration and the mortgage industry have embarked on a controversial project: picking winners and
losers from the rubble of the subprime-mortgage meltdown.
Under the deal, formally released yesterday, the industry would voluntarily help as many as 1.2 million
homeowners who are heading for trouble paying their subprime mortgages but aren't yet lost causes. For
some homeowners, loan-servicing companies will agree to freeze mortgages at their low introductory rates. In
other cases, credit counselors or loan servicers will walk mortgage holders through refinancing processes.
The deal won't provide relief to many subprime-mortgage holders: These include borrowers who are now in
foreclosure, have already refinanced their homes or are more than 60 days delinquent on more than one
payment over the past year. In some cases, people with good credit scores will be excluded. Also left out are
those deemed able to afford the higher interest rates scheduled to replace their introductory rates over the
next two years.
The initiative could help stabilize falling home prices and rising foreclosure rates, buoy the mortgage market
and provide a modicum of comfort to investors watching the housing crisis bleed into the broader economy.
But it also sets what promises to become a battle line as the subprime crisis plays out over the coming
election year. Some critics, especially Democrats, say the plan doesn't go far enough to protect vulnerable
homeowners against foreclosure. Others, including some homeowners, as well as those who have watched
from the sidelines as home prices have soared in recent years, charge that the plan amounts to a bailout for
financially reckless borrowers.
The agreement covers homeowners who have taken out subprime mortgages, those offered typically to
high-risk borrowers. About 1.8 million subprime loans are adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, that carry low
introductory rates that are set to expire in the next two years and adjust upward. These ballooning mortgage
payments would threaten to produce a wave of foreclosures and a spiral of lower home prices and tightening
credit.
The housing crisis is spreading beyond this relatively small subprime universe, causing turmoil on Wall Street
and raising the specter of an economic slowdown. In the third quarter, home foreclosures hit their highest rate
since at least 1972, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Prime adjustable-rate loans -- not
covered in the industry's rescue plan -- accounted for 18.7% of mortgages starting foreclosure, the
second-highest proportion behind subprime adjustable-rate loans. The overall delinquency rate is the highest
since 1986, with some 2.64 million borrowers nationwide behind on payments for their first-lien mortgages for
residences.
Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University and chairman of research firm Roubini Global
Economics, calls the plan "a step in the right direction." But Mr. Roubini says the plan won't turn things
around. "Over the next three years, we're still going to see a housing recession that leads to defaults and
foreclosures," he predicts. "Anything we do now is on the margins."

The agreement, which was hammered out with investors and mortgage companies under the auspices of the
Treasury Department, is the centerpiece of the Bush administration's free-market approach to the mortgage
crisis and may be as far as it is willing to go in the direction of a full bailout. But pressure is likely to increase
as housing and the economy move to the top of the presidential-election agenda. Candidates such as Hillary
Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have come out with their own plans, all of which go further than
the White House is willing to go so far.
Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee,
said he is concerned that the plan sends the wrong message by not helping borrowers who have maintained
good credit scores. These scores can run from 300 (bad) to 850 (ideal). According to the plan, homeowners
scoring 660 or above will be considered fit to pay their mortgages. Such a rule would punish people who have
tried to avoid taking on debt they couldn't handle, Mr. Frank said. He called the decision a "grave error."
Under the new plan, Humberto Goncalves would be on the cusp. The electrician took out an adjustable-rate
mortgage when he bought a home in Cranston, R.I., in 2005. He is current on his mortgage and thinks his
credit score is about 660. Mr. Goncalves says he is already paying about $2,000 a month. "Anything to keep
it from going up would be very helpful," he says. "There's no room for it to go higher."
Gladys and Robert Edmonds believe they should be offered a lifeline as well. The retirees in Tiverton, R.I.,
aren't eligible for government help because they don't have a subprime loan. Instead, the Edmondses, who
live on a fixed income, say they refinanced their home in 2005 by taking out an option ARM, which lets
borrowers pay small amounts early but that risks sharp payment increases later.
The couple has run up credit cards trying to keep current on their home payments, which have climbed from
$1,480 to about $1,800 and will rise again to more than $2,000 in January. They say they were approached
to refinance by a telephone solicitor and that the loan's terms weren't properly explained. "We're not the kind
of people to neglect our debts," says Ms. Edmonds.
At its most basic level, the Bush-supported proposal is aimed at stopping and reversing the real-estate
market's spreading turmoil. As foreclosures have increased, they have added to the number of houses for
sale, depressing prices. Falling prices encourage more people to stop paying their mortgages and go into
default, because their homes are worth less than their loans. More homes go into foreclosure.
The program aims to assist borrowers able to keep up with payments at their introductory rates but who will
likely fall behind and face foreclosure if their rates go up as scheduled.
According to the plan, homeowners would contact credit counselors or their loan-servicing companies, who
would sort them by their credit and payment history and ability to pay. Those 60 days behind on more than
one mortgage payment over the past year would most likely receive no assistance, other than credit
counseling to talk them through the loss of their homes. In the triage of the mortgage industry, they are
considered largely beyond help.
"If the sheriff is at your door hauling out your furniture, and that's the first time you call your lenders, then
you're probably too late," said Steve Bartlett, president of the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade
association of the country's 100 largest banks, mortgage servicers, insurance companies and mutual-fund
companies. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson asked the group to coordinate the industry negotiations, in a
forum called the Hope Now Alliance.
The alliance estimates that 600,000 of the subprime borrowers whose rates will reset in the next two years
fall into this category. They are likely to lose their homes, or, in Mr. Paulson's words, "become renters."
The 1.2 million borrowers relatively current in their mortgages will be considered for the
government-endorsed program. They will pass through the next set of screening to determine whether they
can refinance at more-favorable mortgage rates. Some 600,000 borrowers are expected to qualify. These
borrowers are expected to be offered counseling and a fast track to secure refinanced mortgages.
The remaining 600,000 won't qualify to refinance their existing mortgage,the alliance estimates. Such
borrowers' loan servicers or counselors would determine whether they can afford to pay the higher interest
rates once their introductory rates expire. The servicers will assume that those with better credit scores and
more equity can afford to pay when their existing loans adjust upward. They would receive no special
assistance.
Those who can't afford the higher payments, and who have credit scores below 660 and less than 3% equity
in their homes, will get the biggest break from the lenders. They receive a five-year extension on their
introductory interest rates, with the possibility that the grace period will be extended. Such a rate freeze
would be available only to people who live in the mortgaged properties.

--- Page 152 ---

A middle group, who may or may not struggle with the increased interest rates, will have to negotiate
individually with their loan-servicing companies to secure a rate freeze, repayment holiday or other relief.
Mortgage-industry officials say they aren't sure how many subprime borrowers will ultimately see their rates
frozen.
Mr. Bush, speaking in front of a White House fireplace mantel festooned with greenery and gold ornaments,
sought mainly to calm homeowners. "The holidays are fast approaching, and unfortunately, this will be a time
of anxiety for Americans worried about their mortgages and their homes," he said.
He said the initiative was focused squarely on borrowers, not on investors. "We should not bail out lenders,
real-estate speculators or those who made the reckless decision to buy a home they knew they could never
afford," Mr. Bush said. "Yet there are some responsible homeowners who could avoid foreclosure with some
assistance."
Treasury Secretary Paulson addressed some of the criticism about the plan's scope. "The approach
announced today is not a silver bullet," he told reporters yesterday. "We face a difficult problem for which
there is no perfect solution."
The program will be closely watched in markets around the world, where subprime defaults have triggered
steep write-downs and constrictions in credit markets. Many banks and investment funds invested in complex
securities backed by subprime mortgages, which promised high returns but are now battered and difficult to
value.
The rescue package suggests that most investors prefer to give up some interest revenue rather than carry
out expensive foreclosures of thousands of homes. But the plan won't reduce their losses by much. Analysts
at Barclays Capital Research said in a report that the Treasury's plan could reduce cumulative losses from
subprime loans by 0.6 to 1 percentage point, "which is not much relief when losses could reach 13% to 15%."
Investors who hold mortgages, meanwhile, would still bear the risk of the loans under the plan, said Doug
Dachille, chief executive of First Principles Capital Management in New York, which invests in some
mortgage-backed securities. Creditors would also bear the pain of forgone income from mortgages that under
normal market conditions would have brought higher interest income.
"There ought to be costs to both the borrowers and lenders, but right now you're just giving a freebie to
homeowners," he says. "They still get to live in their house and benefit from any appreciation in the value of
the house over the next few years."
Milton Ezrati, market strategist with money-management firm Lord Abbett &Co., says the plan could
undermine the market for mortgage-backed securities. Investors may say, "if you can interrupt my cash flow
today, you can do it tomorrow," says Mr. Ezrati.
Another question concerns mortgage servicers, the companies that collect payments on behalf of the
eventual debt holder: Can they change the terms of mortgages without being sued by the investors who
purchased them?
Jordan Schwartz, a structured-finance partner at law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &Taft LLP, says
agreements that govern mortgage securities generally give servicers discretion to modify loans if they
consider it to be in the best interest of investors who hold the securities. But any plan that emerges from
Washington "won't have the force of law," he says.
George P. Miller, executive director of the American Securitization Forum, a trade association of investors,
servicers and other securitization players, said servicers won't receive a guarantee against being sued. But
because the plan was created by major industry players, including his group, and was endorsed by the
Treasury Department, it offers a substantial shield against lawsuits.
Alan Gulick, a spokesman for Washington Mutual Inc., Seattle, the sixth-largest subprime servicer, according
to Inside Mortgage Finance, said the bank is "supportive of the proposal." Mike Heid, co-president of home
mortgages at Wells Fargo &Co., the eighth-largest servicer, said his bank played a key role in developing the
plan to help consumers who have managed their mortgages well but are "caught in the current whirlwind of
market forces."

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Hunting for Returns: Tips for TIPS --- Treasury
inflation-protected securities offer benefits as part of a long-term investment strategy

With oil and gold prices near record highs, should you protect your bond portfolio against inflation?
Inflation-protected Treasurys -- or a mutual fund that owns them -- could make sense if you plan to rely on
bonds for income over a long period. But bond professionals caution against diving in just because Treasury
inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have posted stellar gains this year.
"Investors should be wary of chasing TIPS returns," says Seamus Brown, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan.
Asset Management in New York. "TIPS work best as part of a longer-term allocation strategy."
For now, few people see inflation as a major threat. The world economy remains strong and the dollar has
been sliding, making U.S. imports more costly. But tighter credit and a badly sagging housing sector are
expected to hurt U.S. economic growth, and government data suggest that higher energy prices so far
haven't had a broad impact on inflation. Indeed, investors believe that the Federal Reserve, which has cut
short-term interest rates twice to quell market turmoil, will do so again.
Still, some bond investors worry about the longer-term threat of inflation, resulting from easier monetary
policy now. "The Fed is getting to a point where it is having to make a tough choice between growth and
inflation," says Daniel Dektar, chief investment officer at Smith Breeden Associates Inc., Chapel Hill, N.C.
Because they perform so differently than most other securities, inflation-protected bonds can provide a
valuable source of diversification in markets that increasingly are dancing to the same tune.
Financial advisers recommend putting 5% to 10% of a broader portfolio in TIPS, says Jim Tracy, national
sales director for Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.'s Hartford Mutual Funds. "That can bring down
volatility and, in the long term, raise your overall fixed-income returns," he adds.
TIPS, which the U.S. Treasury began issuing a decade ago, are the most readily available variety of domestic
inflation-linked securities. They carry the U.S. government's top-tier credit standing and offer one of the
purest forms of inflation protection. Their principal amount is adjusted periodically for changes in the U.S.
consumer price index, and you also earn a small amount of additional interest.
There's a downside to owning TIPS directly: Any upward principal adjustment is federally taxable, even
though you don't actually pocket it until the bonds are sold. People who own TIPS in mutual funds or
exchange-traded funds also face the tax liability, but principal increases are paid out via distributions, which
means you aren't taxed on money you don't actually have in hand. (You can postpone these tax bills by
holding your inflation-indexed bonds or funds inside a tax-deferred retirement account.)
Despite the periodic adjustment to the principal amount and interest payments, TIPS still pose market risk in
periods of broadly rising interest rates. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices, so if yields are
going up, bonds generally drop in value.
That isn't a worry for those who buy and hold a bond for the long haul; provided the issuer doesn't have
severe financial problems, upon maturity you'll get your full principal back. But funds constantly replace
maturing bonds with new ones, and the net asset value of a bond fund is based on daily values. So
shareholders selling a fund after rates have risen will be hit by falling bond prices that can result in a capital
loss.
TIPS can be more volatile than other bonds. Their maturities tend to be longer than those of conventional
Treasurys, and longer-maturity bonds gyrate more in reaction to broad shifts in sentiment.
But this year, TIPS are tops. Inflation-protected funds posted an average 10.5% return through Nov. 29, the
best of 13 major bond-fund categories tracked by fund researcher Morningstar Inc. Rather than stemming

from inflation worries, those gains resulted more from a stampede in late summer to the haven of U.S.
government bonds as fears of mounting home-mortgage defaults roiled the markets.
Inflation-protected bond funds come in many flavors. Here are some to consider:
-- Plain-Vanilla Treasury Funds: The $11.4 Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund takes a
straightforward approach involving TIPS and conventional Treasurys, says manager Ken Volpert. Like others
Vanguard products, it has a low expense ratio, which is the annual fee you pay to the firm each year for
management. The fee: 0.20% of assets a year. Hartford Inflation Plus fund also takes a relatively
conservative approach.
-- Funds That Mix TIPS With Other Securities: Pimco Real Return fund, with more than $11 billion in bonds,
invests mostly in TIPS. It also diversifies by owning some corporate, mortgage and non-U.S. bonds. The fund
is a pick of Stamford, Conn., planner Matthew Tuttle. because of Pimco's strong record in managing bonds.
-- Exchange-Traded Funds: A pure TIPS play is iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund ETF, an offering of
Barclays Global Investors. Because it is based on a Lehman index of U.S. TIPS, the fund moves closely in
sync with the broader TIPS market. ETFs trade on exchanges throughout the day just like stocks. While this
is another low-cost option, brokerage fees can erode that advantage if you trade often.
-- Closed-End Funds: Western Asset/Claymore Inflation Linked Securities &Income trades on an exchange
like an ETF, but closed-end funds are different from ETFs in that they sell shares in an initial public offering,
not continually based on demand; as a result, closed-end funds' shares often trade at either a discount or
premium to their net asset value, depending on demand for them. This fund invests mostly in TIPS but also
can own non-U.S. securities and may use futures contracts or other derivative instruments. The fund recently
traded at about a 12% discount to its net asset value.
-- Funds That Don't Own TIPS: J.P. Morgan Tax Aware Real Return fund owns mostly municipal bonds and
hedges against inflation with derivatives based on the CPI. The strategy uses the tax-exempt status of munis
to limit taxable distributions.

Terry Teachout says a top-priced theater ticket in the 1960s cost $11, whereas today tickets run in the
hundreds of dollars, which he believes substantially outpaces inflation, "The Price of the Ticket," (Leisure
&Arts, Nov. 24).
Actually, in the 1960s $11 bought about one-third of an ounce of gold, while today about $250 buys the
same. Top-tier Broadway tickets may be slightly more expensive today, but in constant terms, not much.

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Lessons Learned From a Wild Year --- What should

The year 2007 is destined to be memorable for investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a record
high 34 times. Two closing milestones -- 13000 and 14000 -- have been notched.
But it has been anything but a comfortable ride. The Dow is now off 792.81 points from its record close of
14164.53 on Oct. 9. Since this summer, volatility has been a regular part of the picture, triggered by fears of
huge waves of mortgage defaults. Banks, Wall Street firms, insurance companies and other institutional
investors from around the world have tallied up tens of billions of dollars in losses from bad bets on
complicated mortgage securities packaged by Wall Street with acronyms -- CDOs in SIVs, for instance -- now
familiar from negative headlines. So far this year, the U.S. stock market has seen 20 daily swings bigger than
2%, far above the three to four typical of the past few years.
With the end of this roller-coaster year in sight, we invited a dozen prominent figures in the investment-fund
arena to answer a simple question: What is the most important lesson that individual investors should take
from this wild ride, and how can they apply that lesson next year?
Here are edited excerpts of their responses:
Dan Fuss
Vice Chairman, Co-Portfolio Manager
Loomis, Sayles &Co.
The lesson you have to carry forward is that about the worst thing you can do is get into frequent asset
reallocations. There's a financial cost going from fund A to fund B. The more important cost is that it messes
up your thinking about what it is you want to accomplish with these funds.
You should make asset reallocations only if your goal changes -- or, in the extreme case you have one major
asset class that goes bananas one way or the other. An example would be stocks in 1987, when you got
precipitous change in the price level [a 36% decline in the Dow]. That's so extreme, I would sell half of my
bond portfolio, and allocate part of those funds to stocks.
What we had so far is not extreme. There are some headlines that do scare. There are scary things going on.
This involves the banks, and every time banks are included, you really do have to worry. But I would not react
to those sharp ups and downs here. I would just look at your goals and have your money in the right place in
regard to your goals.
[Well-run bond funds try] to maintain a balance between current yield and preservation of capital. My
preference is a bond fund with flexibility to be in each of the markets [Treasurys, high-yield, mortgages, etc.].
You want the manager, within reason, to be able to adjust in this changing environment.
Bill Gross
Chief Investment Officer, Founder
Pacific Investment Management Co.
What began on a high note of global growth and euphoric optimism for risk markets is ending with fear of
hidden subprimes and the loss of AAA ratings galore. 2007 was the year when our modern-day shadow
banking system lost its innocence.

"Too securitized to fail" was exposed for what it always was: "garbage in, garbage out." Hundreds of billions
in losses await those that took the AAA Kool-Aid, and a frozen "deer in the highlights" investment community
stands by in hopes of central-bank salvation. The rate cuts will come, but salvation will dangle tantalizingly
out of reach.
But to think that our SIVs or our CDOs or even our supposedly impregnable trillion-dollar, asset-backed,
commercial-paper market will revive anytime soon is a stretch of the imagination. If they don't, all of the
assets they supported in years past will suffer downside potential: home prices, of course, as well as
financial- and then consumer-based stocks.
Importantly, add to the list of victims the strength and viability of our national currency. A run on George
Washington into emerging-market currencies is under way. Expect it to continue. Your portfolio in 2008
should reflect a global bias with non-dollar-denominated assets.
Harry Lange
Portfolio Manager
Fidelity Magellan Fund
The key lesson that fund investors should learn from 2007 and apply to 2008 -- and beyond -- is the
importance of portfolio diversification in a volatile market.
There have been broad disparities in the performance of various equity markets and market sectors in 2007.
In spite of the large swings up and down, however, many diversified fund investors who stayed the course
were able to achieve positive returns. It would have been a mistake to trade in and out of funds based on
short-term market moves or daily changes in the news. Recent volatility notwithstanding, the S&P 500
returned 3.29% year to date through Nov. 23, but the MSCI EAFE index [of overseas developed-market
stocks] returned 10.8%. That meant that if investors didn't have a meaningful position in international funds,
they missed an opportunity for strong gains.
Within the U.S., S&P 500 sector returns varied from 25.2% for energy to negative 18.6% for financials
through Nov. 23. After long periods of outperformance by small-cap stocks over large-cap stocks, and value
stocks over growth stocks, new leaders emerged this year. Across all styles -- value, blend and growth --
large-cap funds have outperformed small-cap funds on average. As a result, investors with portfolios heavily
tilted toward value and small-cap funds coming into 2007 underperformed due to their lack of appropriate
diversification.
What markets, sectors or styles will outperform in 2008? Tough to say. The markets are notoriously difficult to
predict over short periods, which makes portfolio diversification critical for every fund investor who is focused
on reaching his or her financial goals.

The circumstances change, but the lessons are almost always the same. "Don't get greedy and "don't get
excited" are my two favorites from 2007. Investors were protected in money-market funds, but suffered
damages in a lot of investments that claimed to yield more than "cash" with no additional risk. Some
ultrashort bond funds, stable-value funds, bank-loan funds, and "enhanced cash" funds suffered losses in the
asset-backed securities and mortgage-market meltdowns. Many investors, who likely shouldn't have been in
these less-liquid vehicles in the first place, fled at the first sign of losses, compounding the problems for those
left behind.
Investors should ignore market movements and match their investments to their current and future needs. If
there is any chance you might need the cash in the next year or two, money-market funds should be your
only option. If you have time for income or growth, invest long term in a diversified portfolio of stocks and
bonds.
With money-market funds, some investors made the mistake of fleeing to Treasury funds, which offered pitiful
yields. They were in effect shooting themselves in the foot, losing two percentage points of yield, in order to
avoid the remote possibility of losing perhaps one percentage point of yield should their adviser not "bail out"
their prime money fund [to make up for losses on subprime-mortgage securities]. Prime funds, the main class
of money-market funds, yield 5%, and Treasury funds yield 3%.

All of the [money-market] fund firms have absorbed the financial losses, so you're handing yourself a loss to
avoid the possibility of a loss. The reaction far outweighed the risk.
John Bogle
Founder
Vanguard Group
I have to tell you, I am concerned. The volatility is enormous.
I think a very important lesson is: Don't let your emotions drive your investment program, because you will be
thinking of getting in and out. For investors the best rule by and large is to ignore the daily moves of the stock
market. The stock market is a giant distraction for the business of investing.
Buy and hold a very diversified portfolio, U.S. and global. Minimize trading fees, mutual-fund management
fees and sales loads, and investment-bank fees.
Another important lesson: Always hold some bonds. I happen to like short-term bonds better than money
markets, because they yield a bit more and they don't fluctuate very much more -- high-quality short-term
bonds, 10% to 20% of your portfolio. If you are older, a lot more than that.
Another very clear lesson this year for investors is: avoid complexity. If you don't know what the fund is
investing in, don't buy it. Wall Street has created those derivatives and those collateralized debt obligations of
very uncertain problems with very high risk, just to earn a little more return. Another lesson is that, if you think
you are getting a premium yield, assume that you are taking a premium risk.
Looking ahead to the next year, be risk-averse. I would never tell anybody to get out of the stock market. You
want to think of how your account is balanced. For example, if you normally want to be 75% in stocks, I'd
rather be 65% than 85%. I believe it's a good time to be a little more cautious.

In 2007 we learned a number of things, but perhaps a better way of putting it is: We confirmed a number of
things that we have noticed for a few years now.
First, I confirmed that the increasingly complex and opaque accounting of public companies leaves investors,
lenders and the public more and more confused. Therefore, we are faced with a situation where massive
liabilities are not decipherable from company or bank reports. The accounting bodies establish rules that
result in (a) additional complexity and opacity, as well as (b) extensive discretionary power put in the hands of
the auditors, enabling them to present accounts in a variety of ways suitable to management.
Second, I confirmed that poor corporate governance is not a monopoly of emerging markets but is alive and
well in all major markets around the world.
Finally, I confirmed that we are living in a wonderful period of mankind's history where the life of individuals
around the world has improved dramatically and continues to improve as the world's two most populous
countries, India and China, attain the world's fastest economic growth rates.
Emerging markets around the world are doing very well, with their economies and stock markets booming.
However, investors must remind themselves that economies and stock markets are constantly changing. It
has been proved time and time again that most of the time forecasts of these evolving phenomena cannot be
accurate. Investors should thus ensure they are diversified across many markets. The coming year promises
to be an exciting one with high volatility.

This year has served as a reminder that making decisions in an uncertain world is difficult. Economic
forecasts are not consistently accurate enough to serve as a basis for investment decisions. They also say
nothing about the degree to which risks are already reflected in financial asset prices. While the economy is
very likely to weaken, the magnitude of any slowdown will only be known after the fact. It is even possible that

the U.S. economy will surprise on the upside relative to expectations, with the aid of the Fed easing, a weak
dollar that stimulates exports and global growth driven by emerging markets. Getting excessively defensive
could result in missing out on returns that could be captured during a few more years of economic growth. On
the other hand, stocks could drop as much as 20% or even more in a cyclical bear market. So, depending on
how things play out, 2008 could range from a very rough year to a good year.
Except for those who are lucky, making big bets based on a specific view of how the big picture will play out
in the near term is speculating, not investing. So rather than bet on a single outcome (e.g., recession and a
bear market), investors should consider looking past 2008 and focus on the long term with a portfolio that is
consistent with their long-term investment objectives. But it should also be one they can live with in
shorter-term market dislocations such as a cyclical bear market.
For investors who have sensitivity to short-term risk, this means owning some investment-grade bonds,
probably through a bond fund. Additional benefits could come from some non-dollar bond exposure if the
dollar continues to weaken. Equities should be diversified globally to broaden the investment universe, allow
for participation in faster-growing economies and for currency diversification. We favor larger-cap stocks over
smaller-caps because we believe larger-caps currently offer better value, and because they usually perform
better late in the economic cycle. Generally, they also have more exposure to the faster growth occurring
outside the U.S.
Some commodity exposure via a mutual fund that invests in commodity futures provides a low-correlation
asset, some inflation hedge and additional dollar hedge. These asset classes can be mixed in different
proportions depending on a given investor's risk and return objectives.

Other than the obvious truths of not putting your eggs in one basket and not chasing returns, I would say the
most important lesson investors can learn is when to sell.
For reasons of ego more than anything else, investors can often be found holding on to their former darlings
well past their season of bloom. Now, if you really think the current market is wrong and you are sure a
particular security you have is going to come back, why not peel some of it off in case you are wrong? Give
yourself some odds here: You're 75% certain a stock will turn around, so sell 25% of it. Risk management is a
key part of successful investing.
Look at your investments with a sliver of ice in your heart -- the same way Graham Greene used to revise his
novels. Ego is not your friend, and it can definitely be your enemy if that's what you really have invested in
your losing positions.
Jean-Marie Eveillard

First Eagle Funds
We had a financial crisis in August, the sixth in 20 years. Investors seem to believe -- maybe they are right --
the odds are good that the crisis will be handled successfully, at least in the short term. The odds may be
pretty good that crisis No. 6, within the next three to six months, will be gone.
But individual investors should remember one thing: Sometimes what matters is not how low the odds are
that something totally negative might happen. Sometimes what matters more is what the consequences
would be if that something truly negative happens.
Unless we are talking about play money, or money that otherwise will be spent in Las Vegas, caution is
always in order. Caution is more in order in 2008.
Value investors in a way are always on the side of caution. If you are a value investor, you are a long-term
investor, so by definition you don't try to keep up in the short term with your peers and with the benchmark.
Pick a good value mutual fund. Read Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor" first. Then read [fund]
prospectuses and annual reports to see whether the manager is a "genuine" value investor or not. Here are a
few things to look at: long-term track record; portfolio turnover ratio (anybody who has a ratio of 100% a year
is not a value investor); managers [who] pick stocks based on intrinsic value rather than chasing market
psychologies.

Natural resources/energy is one sector where one has to adopt a long-term perspective, given the huge
day-to-day volatility, as the market is not efficient in catching up to the sea change in world commodity prices,
leaving the commodity stocks very undervalued relative to reasonable commodity price expectations.
Investors who are unable to distance themselves mentally from the periodic sharp downturns, and who sell,
or who believe the stocks are reflective of current prices and try to call a top in current prices, and who sell as
a result, wind up missing out on the subsequent outperformance.
This sector has had a really good run for seven years, so a number of people have been recommending all
along the way to get off the train. We came into the year with market expectations for longer-term oil prices
averaging about $45 a barrel. Now, we've got the futures market saying that oil prices will be $84 [beyond 12
months], and the stock market saying $55 [deduced from prices of oil stocks]. It takes longer for the stock
market to catch up. Our assessment is somewhere north of $70.
If you are short-term-oriented, you will get shaken out during real sharp downturns, and you will be drawn in
by real sharp upturns.
One should have 5% to 10% of assets in something that does not correlate with the market, either a gold
fund or natural-resources fund.
In general, [the natural-resources] sector does have some correlation to the overall global economy. If the
subprime [lending] mess takes down world growth rates, it will have a relatively small, but some, effect on the
stocks in this sector.

A lot of people are scared away when they hear the headlines of big declines in the market. It's very important
not to be caught up in the prevailing sentiment, because usually those are not good times to sell when the
market is going down. In fact, this is really an illustration of the importance of what we call dollar-cost
averaging. Basically, you have [an automatic-deduction] program where you buy $200 of mutual funds. When
the market goes down, that $200 buys you more shares, and when the market goes up, it buys you less
shares.
This is an approach which has been known for years. In these volatile times, it gains the most.
Kenneth Heebner

CGM Realty Fund
The lesson is that valuation is critical. When valuations become high relative to historical norms, it is time to
sell.
In the first quarter of 2007, CGM Realty Fund sold most of its real-estate investment trusts. We believed that
after many years of appreciation, the valuation on these stocks had reached extreme levels.
Since reaching a peak in February, real-estate investment trusts have declined substantially, and, we believe,
their values are becoming more reasonable. We have begun a process of moving back into real-estate
investment trusts. The areas where we find opportunity are retail REITs. We don't believe a wavering of
consumer confidence on account of the current housing problem or any hesitation in retail sales will hurt the
growth in funds-from-operations from these REITs. The principal driver of growth in retail REITs is the rolling

over of five- and 10-year old leases to substantially higher rent levels reflecting the increase in rental rates
over these time periods.
We continue to invest in the strength of the global economy within the real-estate investment trust universe.
[We also] find industrial REITs that focus on activity at port levels, particularly those with significant foreign
operations, to be very attractive.

Citi's Deal May Be Wiser Than Thought

Citi's Deal May Be Wiser Than Thought

At first glance, Citigroup looks like it paid a dear price to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for its $7.5 billion
capital infusion.
This week Citigroup, in exchange for Abu Dhabi's investment to buttress Citigroup's coffers, agreed to issue
convertible preferred shares to the Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund. The shares will convert to a 4.9%
stake in the bank in about three years and Citigroup will pay Abu Dhabi an 11% interest rate in the interim.
Critics said Citigroup was taken to the cleaners by Abu Dhabi and pointed out that even companies rated junk
only pay 9% interest rates.
But looks can be deceiving.
Details of the deal, which is private, are scant, and therefore analysts say it is difficult to value. However,
many agree that the dividend on the preferred shares isn't unreasonable compared with the 7.4% dividend
yield on Citigroup's common shares at the time the deal was announced.
Looked at this way, Abu Dhabi is getting a 3.4 percentage-point premium for stepping up when everyone else
was fleeing the sector. In addition, the structure of the deal limits Abu Dhabi's upside and the potential dilution
of Citigroup shares, other reasons why the investment fund should get a premium to the dividend. Finally,
Abu Dhabi's ability to sell its shares will be restricted through 2014.
In this deal, Abu Dhabi's shares will convert into Citigroup common stock between March 2010 and
September 2011, with the amount of the shares to be determined by where Citigroup shares are trading. The
terms include a lower strike price of $31.83 and a cap of $37.24. The lower strike price limits Abu Dhabi's
downside but also caps its upside if the share price increases sharply.
The number of common shares granted to Abu Dhabi falls as the share-price rises. If it rises to $37.24 or
above, Abu Dhabi will receive a maximum of 201.4 million shares, but if it falls to $31.83 or below, the fund
receives 235.6 million. If the price is within the range, Abu Dhabi gets some amount of shares in between,
depending on an undisclosed formula. Traders call this range, which limits Abu Dhabi's upside, the "dead
zone."
For its part, Citigroup managed to raise tax-deductible, tier-one capital. It has also locked in a long-term
investor who has promised not to meddle much in its daily affairs, which, in this age of shareholder
disgruntlement and activism, could be worth its weight in gold.

Gold Stages Rally, Up 30% for Year --- Oil Sets a High, Soybeans Rally, But Trading Is Thin

Gold Stages Rally, Up 30% for Year --- Oil Sets a High, Soybeans Rally, But Trading Is Thin

Gold futures rallied on an overnight low in the dollar, strength in crude oil and bullish technical patterns,
analysts said. Trading volume was light on the Friday after Thanksgiving.
"Maybe some of these moves are exaggerated because of that," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst
with Future Path Trading. "But it's speculators and funds coming back into the gold."
Nearby November gold rose $26.40 an ounce to $824.00. Most-active December gold gained $26.10 to
$824.70 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold prices are now up 30% on the year.
The initial catalyst, analysts said, was the dollar index falling to a record low of 74.484 overnight and the euro
hitting a high against the U.S. currency. Friday, the dollar finished up 0.1% against the euro, with the
European currency buying $1.4838.
But in an abbreviated Comex session, gold extended its gains late in the day even though the dollar index
eventually moved slightly higher.
"Gold was up off of the dollar early, then the crude oil turned around after being down on the day," said Dave
Rinehimer, director of futures research with Citigroup Global Markets.
Speculation the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again because of further subprime and credit-market
fallout weighed on the dollar, a research note from MKS Finance said.
Some of gold's support amid high crude-oil prices stems from concerns about rising inflation, which tends to
support gold, said Ira Epstein, chief executive of Ira Epstein &Co. Futures.
"The market is realizing that overall inflation, regardless of what our government would like us to believe, is
alive, well and thriving," Mr. Epstein said.
Mr. Rinehimer said some technical-chart buying was triggered in gold.
"When we got above Wednesday's high of $808, that probably activated some buying," he said. "And the
same thing over $820."
The latter level is near the Nov. 15 high of $819.40. The next upside chart level traders are eying is last
week's $833.60 peak, Mr. Rinehimer added.
MKS Finance analysts said that a recent consolidation period for gold was probably helpful technically and
may help it test its record $850 high.
In other commodity markets:
CRUDE OIL: Prices on the Nymex jumped to an exchange- record Friday as positive momentum in the U.S.
stock market overpowered data indicating OPEC is upping its oil output. Thin trading contributed to volatility.
January crude oil rose 89 cents, or 0.9%, to $98.18 a barrel.
NATURAL GAS: Futures rose as traders bought back previously sold positions ahead of the December
contract expiration amid forecasts of chillier weather next week in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. Nymex
December gas ended 15 cents, or 2%, higher at $7.70 a million British thermal units.

SOYBEANS: Chicago Board of Trade futures rallied to 34-year highs on export demand, technical-chart
buying and strength in commodity prices in general. January soybeans gained 16.25 cents at $11.0025 a
bushel.

Big Buybacks Begin to Haunt Firms --- Dow Ends Up 51.70 Despite Growing Signs Of Economic Slowdown
Tuesday's Markets
Big Buybacks Begin to Haunt Firms --- Dow Ends Up 51.70 Despite Growing Signs Of Economic
Slowdown

Stocks enjoyed a late surge despite growing concerns about economic growth and a rally that returned crude
oil to record territory near $100 a barrel.
Other assets offered a stark picture of investors' worries regarding the economy. The dollar hit a record low
against the euro. The price of gold, a traditional haven, leapt 1.7%. Yield spreads between Treasurys and
so-called agency debt -- supposedly safe securities often used to back mortgages -- have been widening,
suggesting that bond buyers view the agencies as riskier than before.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off as much as 118.76 points during the day but ended 51.70 points
higher at 13010.14, up 0.4% for the day and 4.4% on the year. The blue-chip indicator's strongest component
in percentage terms yesterday was energy giant Exxon Mobil, up 4.4% because of the oil rally.
The Dow's gain was only its third in the past 10 trading days, during which it has tumbled 4.8%, often beset
by worries about bad mortgage bets on Wall Street, falling home prices and their possible ripple effect on the
broader economy.
Analysts said those issues remain at the fore, and in recent days many have cautioned not to read too much
into this week's trading as a harbinger, considering that many market participants have already left their
trading screens ahead of tomorrow's Thanksgiving holiday. Such situations tend to sap volume from the
market and, in some cases, add volatility and enable computer-generated orders late in the session to swing
the market more than usual.
"There's a crisis going on in the financial world that has the potential to spill into the real world by the
mechanism that you eventually may not be able to get credit" for home purchases or everyday spending,
says strategist Howard Simons of Bianco Research in Chicago. "I don't think we'll fall into a black hole or a
recession, but we still have to deal with some things no one quite understands."
Mr. Simons alluded to the sophisticated credit instruments on the books of major Wall Street firms that have
led to write-downs and quarterly losses.
Investors digested another such announcement yesterday as home lender Freddie Mac announced a $2
billion third-quarter loss and said it is "seriously considering" slashing its fourth-quarter dividend in half. Its
shares plummeted 29%.
The Federal Reserve released minutes of its policy meeting last month, which showed that officials were
concerned about slowing growth when they decided to cut their key interest-rate target. Some investors
interpreted the comments as a hint that the Fed might also cut rates again next month.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.45%, or 6.43 points, to 1439.70 and is up 1.5% on the
year. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 0.13%, or 3.43 points, to 2596.81, up 7.5% on the
year.
Cold weather in the Northeast and today's scheduled release of weekly energy-inventory data prompted
energy traders to bid up crude futures for January delivery by $3.39, or 3.6%, to an exchange record close of
$98.03 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rose, and bond prices were mixed. The 10-year note gained 6/32 point, or $1.875 for each $1,000
invested, pushing the yield down to 4.055%. The 30-year bond fell 4/32 to yield 4.484%.

The dollar was mixed. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose to 109.89 yen, compared with 109.81
yen. The euro rose to $1.4812, from $1.4666.

Common Sense: For Now, Go Cautiously, And Buy Nasdaq at 2575

After Monday's triple-digit plunge below 13000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was nearing its August
lows, with financial stocks and home builders again leading the way down. But here the similarity between
then and now ends.
In August, there was a credit panic followed by an interest-rate cut and inflation fears that drove oil, gold and
other commodities to record levels. Now, just three months later, inflation has given way to a new fear:
recession. A brief rally yesterday morning led the average above 13000, but Freddie Mac's poor earnings and
concerns about the depth of the credit crunch sent it down again by the afternoon. The average closed just
above 13000.
In the intervening months, I've read all sorts of reassuring reports on the health of the financial system, the
prospects for technology spending and the vitality of the American consumer. They all had just one caveat:
All bets are off if there is a recession.
Recession fears appear to have been the driving force in the market's recent turmoil. Among the hardest hit
have been economy-sensitive sectors that were supposed to benefit from lower interest rates, a weak dollar
and stronger inflation -- the forces driving the market back in August.
Over the past week (through Monday), some of the weakest sectors have been construction and farm
machinery (-2.32%), gold (-2.59%), chemicals (-3.91%), paper and packaging (-5.96%), airlines (-6.2%),
metals and mining (-6.55%), autos (-9.95%) and trucking (-11.66%). Until this week, many were among the
year's best-performing areas, and had rebounded strongly after August's slump.
Among these tidings of bad cheer, the consumer discretionary sector was also hard hit as the holiday
shopping season got under way. Apparel was down 4.03%, general merchandise down 5.01% and
department stores dropped 6.1%. Everyone seems to be ratcheting down their expectations for the season,
with Thanksgiving discounts already proliferating.
So will there or won't there be a recession?
You already have the answer to that: No one knows. Once we do, the opportunities to make money from the
present uncertainty will have vanished.
For the record, no one -- at least no one in a position of responsibility and authority -- is using the "R" word.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has been warning of an economic slowdown in the U.S., but
measures of global growth remain strong. At the same time, the latest inflation readings have remained
tame, even with a weak dollar. Little more than a month ago, investors were giddy with hopes for a soft
landing, driving market averages to new highs. What, really, has changed?
My own sense is that investors' recent mood swings have been overdone at the extremes of both optimism
and pessimism, and that caution remains the appropriate stance. I'm not changing my own approach, which
remains focused on stocks of companies that benefit from global growth, a weak dollar and strong
commodities prices. I'm not rushing into defensive areas. I'm still avoiding the financial sector, which
continues to spew forth unwelcome surprises.
Meanwhile, for those of you recalibrating your buy and sell thresholds in line with the Common Sense system,
a 10% decline from the Nasdaq high of 2860 reached on Halloween is 2575, which is my new buying target.
That's when the holiday shopping season will really begin (at least for stocks), so it's not too soon to be
preparing your list.

Oil Surge Suggests Prices Might Stay High

Oil Surge Suggests Prices Might Stay High

Crude-oil prices leapt 3.6% to a new commodities-market high of more than $98 a barrel, adding to growing
evidence that the cost could remain high for months and pose a challenge to the economies of many
industrialized nations.
A survey of energy analysts by Dow Jones Newswires released yesterday found these observers believed oil
prices would stay strong well into next year. They forecast that prices would simmer down only at the end of
2008, as the world's richest economies, including the U.S., begin to flag.
The weakening U.S. dollar, the currency used to buy and sell oil globally, is helping reinforce the notion that
oil prices could remain high. The dollar fell against the euro yesterday after the Federal Open Market
Committee released minutes from its most recent meeting. A weaker dollar blunts the effect of higher oil
prices outside the U.S. and gives purchasers in other currencies greater power.
A barrel of oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $3.39 a barrel, its third straight gain, to close at
$98.03 a barrel. That is less than the cost of a trader's subway fare home from topping $100 a barrel, and not
far from the inflation-adjusted high of $102 a barrel set in April 1980.
Looking ahead, energy analysts see little to reverse current trends that have sent oil on its record trajectory
this year. "Demand growth has been surprisingly strong, especially in the emerging markets, supply hasn't
really responded, and the weaker [U.S.] dollar has driven up prices because of strong demand in the U.K.
and Europe," said Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC senior economic adviser Thorsten Fischer.
Price expectations have climbed substantially in recent weeks. According to the survey of energy analysts
from more than 30 banks and other institutions, the forecast for the median price of oil in the current quarter
shot up 21% to $88 a barrel. Crude prices next year are expected to average $76 in 2008, up 12% from the
same survey last month.
Yesterday's surge in crude-oil prices underscores the extraordinary volatility energy markets are facing. Last
week, prices dropped after signs of weakening demand appeared, Iraqi oil production showed a surprising
climb, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled it might raise its production ceiling
next month.
But oil markets are still bedeviled by longer-term trends: growing demand from the developing world,
continued supply constraints and political uncertainties in major oil-producing regions like the Middle East.
"Despite apparent weakness in the U.S. economy, the global economy is going ahead. China and India
continue to march forward and demand oil and OPEC isn't supplying much more," says Chris Ross, a vice
president at consulting firm CRA International Inc. While oil prices can turn quickly, he said, "my belief is the
balance of probabilities is towards strength rather than weakness."
The high prices are weighing on economies around the world, hurting big oil consumers such as the U.S. and
nations that subsidize gasoline prices, while filling the coffers of oil producers in the Middle East and
elsewhere. Still, Deutsche Bank chief energy economist Adam Sieminski said that for now, the global
economy can weather high prices. He said that it would take oil prices of $125 to $150 a barrel to cause a
global recession and a price drop.

Oil Surges Above $98 a Barrel --- Inventory Data To Become Focus; Gold Touches $800

Oil Surges Above $98 a Barrel --- Inventory Data To Become Focus; Gold Touches $800

Crude-oil futures surged to a record settlement high above $98 a barrel as the dollar fell, potentially paving
the way for another run at $100.
Expectations of colder weather toward the end of the month in the Northeast, the world's biggest heating-oil
market, as well as a fire at an oil-sands upgrader in Canada and positioning before key weekly U.S. inventory
data also boosted crude prices.
Light, sweet crude for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $3.39, or 3.6%, to settle
at $98.03 a barrel, a record for a front-month contract. Prices rose as high as $98.62 after contract
settlement, equaling the record reached Nov. 7.
"The rise in crude is relentless, and it's going higher for the same reasons: the dollar keeps getting crushed,
supplies are tight . . . and there are geopolitical issues" that could crimp the flow of oil if they worsen, said
Tom Bentz, an analyst at brokerage BNP Commodity Futures in New York. "I can see us going well over
$100."
Prices are still below the inflation-adjusted record price of U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude
oil of $102 a barrel set in April 1980.
All eyes will turn now to U.S. inventory data due at 10:30 a.m. EST today, which could push prices above
$100 a barrel. Analysts expect a rise in crude oil stocks according to a Dow Jones Newswires survey, but the
latest price gain indicates many are betting on another decrease in stockpiles, which have fallen three times
in the past four weekly reports.
"All you need is a surprise draw in the statistics and we could easily print new highs," said Tony Rosado of
IAG Energy Brokers in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
The dollar fell to a fresh record low against the euro after minutes from an Oct. 31 Federal Reserve
rate-setting meeting led to some expectations of more interest-rate cuts. The dollar's weakness has been an
important factor in crude's recent record-breaking run, increasing the buying power of traders using other
currencies and blunting the effect of higher oil prices in countries outside the U.S.
Dollar weakness gave the biggest boost to crude prices, but expectations for increased weather-related
demand and some actual supply glitches in Canada and Mexico, both major exporters to the U.S., added
support.
The Northeast, which got snow in many parts Monday, is forecast to get colder-than-normal weather from
Nov. 25 until at least Dec. 3, according to the National Weather Service's midterm-outlook forecasts. The
expectations come as most forecasters are predicting a warmer-than-normal winter and Thanksgiving Day.
Winter heating demand, both through heating oil and electricity in countries that use fuel oil, is expected to
make for a big supply gap in the fourth quarter, according to many predictions. How far temperatures deviate
from normal, in either direction, will play a big part in price moves in coming months.
"The forecasts for colder weather are giving it a boost, at least until somebody comes out and downgrades
the forecast" to warmer weather, said Michael Cambria of Eagle Futures, on the Nymex floor.
A fire at a 155,000 barrels-a-day Royal Dutch Shell PLC oil sands upgrader near Edmonton, Alberta, also
boosted prices.
In other commodity markets:

NATURAL GAS: Futures ended almost 4% lower as high storage levels and forecasts for relatively mild
weather during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend put prices on a downward trajectory. Natural gas for
December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled floor trade 31 cents lower, or 3.98%, at
$7.477 per million British thermal units after reaching a low of $7.459 per million BTUs in combined electronic
and floor trade earlier in the day.
GOLD: Futures rallied as the U.S. dollar slouched and crude oil flexed its muscles, gaining back more than
what they lost in selling during the previous session. Nearby November gold gained $13.50 to $790.30 an
ounce while most-active December gold rose $13.40 to $791.40. In the thinly traded after-hours session
December gold broke above $800.

Black Gold's Yellow Link: Oil Hints Metal May Rise

LONDON -- Sizzling crude-oil prices have outpaced even gold's heady rise this year, throwing the historical
interrelationship between the two commodities out of kilter but not completely off track.
Crude oil and gold still share several key parallels that make the oil-gold ratio a useful barometer, analysts
say.
For the six decades until this one, one ounce of gold bought roughly 12 barrels of crude oil. Yet the gold-oil
ratio is now about 8.5 to 1. On this basis, gold looks cheap; it is as unlikely to double in price as oil is to
plummet.
But gold and oil respond to the same signals, which are positive for the price of both commodities. "Sharp
moves in oil suggest tension in the system and add to inflationary pressures, and gold responds," says
TheBullionDesk's Ross Norman.
The nearby November contract for gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled
Friday at $785.70 a troy ounce, down 5.6% for the week, while Nymex December crude was at $95.10 a
barrel, down 1.3% for the week.
To be sure, gold has long been used as a hedge against inflation; it is deemed to be a store of value when
the value of paper money falls. While some analysts question whether these attributes are justified, few can
deny that gold and oil have benefited from the current inflationary environment.
The situation was the same in the 1970s, when the oil price spike led to a surge in gold because of inflation.
Central banks then acted to get inflation under control, while better alternatives to manage inflation, such as
inflation-linked bonds, were developed.
Yet ever-expanding U.S. debt and a backdrop of worries in the global credit markets mean something has
changed. Analysts say the Federal Reserve is unlikely to fight inflation by raising interest rates to the extent
that it could trigger a recession, as happened in the '80s.
"Now again, inflation is a major worry, but against a very sensitive financial backbone," says Stephen Flood
of Gold Investments. "Gold is reflective of the pressures that high oil prices bring to the economy."
If U.S. growth slows to the extent that it spills over into Asia and the rest of the world, gold is set to
"massively outperform," says Michael Lewis, global head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank.
"A dollar overshoot to the downside is great for gold. It happens when the economic environment is weak
and equities collapse," he says. "This would create global financial-market instability, including exchange-rate
gyrations, declining growth, and create a weakening oil-demand story, which isn't an unrealistic scenario at
the moment."

Weak Dollar Isn't the Inflation Driver It Once Was
THE OUTLOOK
Weak Dollar Isn't the Inflation Driver It Once Was

Inflation warnings are sounding in the U.S. because of the plunging dollar. But they may be false alarms.
Evidence has been building that a weak dollar doesn't fuel inflation like it used to.
A key reason: Foreign exporters are so keen to keep U.S. market share that when the dollar weakens they
often lower their prices to keep them steady in dollar terms. That's especially true when the economy is
slowing and American consumers are less willing to pay higher prices.
A 10% decline in the dollar's value-the drop seen over the past year-might be expected to raise the price of
imports by 10%. But the actual increase has been much less. Studies have found that only one-quarter to
one-tenth of a currency depreciation gets passed through as higher prices for foreign-made goods.
That makes the Federal Reserve's job a bit easier during uncertain times. If the nation's economy slows
sharply, the Fed could give it a boost by lowering interest rates-a move that tends to weaken the dollar even
more-without worrying as much about inflation.
Last month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that while the weaker dollar leads to "some inflationary effect"
as imports' costs rise, "our experience over the recent decade has been that those effects are relatively
small."
The Fed's job is to balance growth and inflation, and few economists believe it should act simply to preserve
the dollar's value. Moreover, for Fed policy makers, the weak dollar has had a timely benefit: It boosts U.S.
exports by making American goods cheaper abroad. That helps ease the pain of the housing slump and
credit crunch.
"Right now, they're going to view this as good, not bad," says Brandeis University professor Stephen
Cecchetti. "There are no tangible inflation risks that are coming out of it."
Markets seem to agree. The dollar's five-year decline hasn't raised inflation expectations, as expressed by
the bond market. Prices of gold, oil and other commodities have surged, but much of the cause has been
growing demand and speculation in financial markets.
A recent study by Fed staffers found that many foreign companies sending goods to the U.S. have given the
American consumer special treatment. As the dollar has fallen, those companies have accepted thinner profit
margins, especially since 2002. They haven't given consumers elsewhere a similar break. That reflects the
dollar's dominance and concerns about losing ground in a key market.
Even if the weak dollar has only a modest impact on inflation, however, it still poses risks.
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, has remained tame in recent months -- within some
Fed officials' 1% to 2% comfort zone. But the dollar's drop could boost the public's inflation expectations,
sparking a self-fulfilling bout of price increases.
The dollar's decline also could create a communications problem for Fed officials, whose policy decisions
aren't aimed at the dollar but can still depress the currency. "It sets the market backdrop which your policy
actions will be interpreted against," said Vincent Reinhart, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute and former head of the Fed's monetary-affairs division. "People might get confused as to why exactly
you're easing policy."
A weakening dollar used to have a bigger impact on import prices. From the mid-1970s through the 1990s,
the pass-through rate was as high as 50%-meaning a 10% drop in the value of the dollar would raise import

--- Page 179 ---
Page 179 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
prices by 5%. This decade the pass-through rate has been less than 25%. For the overall economy, that's still
a small increase because imports are a fraction of the goods consumed.
Of the roughly $2 trillion of products the U.S. imported last year, more than a third came from Asia. Compared
with the euro, Asian currencies have remained far more stable against the dollar, partly because some Asian
countries, like China, manage their currencies to hold down their value. In many cases, too, markups can
make importers' costs for goods from China just a fraction of the ultimate prices charged to U.S. consumers.
The companies bringing goods into the U.S. have the choice of "eating it in their margin or jacking up their
price when the exchange rate moves," Mr. Cecchetti says.
How a falling dollar affects imports can depend on the product involved: The prices of some luxury imports,
such as BMW autos, have stayed steady as their makers have accepted lower profits. Airlines, however, run
on thinner margins and are quicker to raise ticket prices if their costs rise. In addition, price increases on raw
materials, including steel and other commodities, tend to pass through at much higher rates-90% or more-in
part because they are priced globally and tend to affect rivals equally.
Some economists question how long companies that are squeezed by the falling dollar will accept weaker
profits. Joel Popkin, an economist who analyzes price trends at Popkin &Co., says some importers are
starting to seek price increases as their costs rise. "I think we're seeing it now," he said. "If oil continues on its
path we're going to see more pass-through from oil than we've seen before, says Joel Popkin, a private
economist who analyzes price trends. "You're starting to get to the point where the costs can't be absorbed."
Other economists are keeping a sharp eye out for dollar-induced inflation, even as they note that their
economic models suggest little reason to worry. "We're not blind to the risk that something may have
changed," says Lehman Brothers economist Drew Matus. "You can never really tell the regime shifts until it's
too late."
That poses another challenge for the Fed: Identifying the elusive point at which companies abroad might
decide it costs too much to give American consumers preferential treatment.

Oil Officials See Limit Looming on Production --- Politics, Lack of Finds Curtail World Supply; Counting on the Saudis

A growing number of oil-industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe: The world is
approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day.
Some predict that, despite the world's fast-growing thirst for oil, producers could hit that ceiling as soon as
2012. This rough limit -- which two senior industry officials recently pegged at about 100 million barrels a day
-- is well short of global demand projections over the next few decades. Current production is about 85 million
barrels a day.
The world certainly won't run out of oil any time soon. And plenty of energy experts expect sky-high prices to
hasten the development of alternative fuels and improve energy efficiency. But evidence is mounting that
crude-oil production may plateau before those innovations arrive on a large scale. That could set the stage for
a period marked by energy shortages, high prices and bare-knuckled competition for fuel.
The current debate represents a significant twist on an older, often-derided notion known as the peak-oil
theory. Traditional peak-oil theorists, many of whom are industry outsiders or retired geologists, have argued
that global oil production will soon peak and enter an irreversible decline because nearly half the available oil
in the world has been pumped. They've been proved wrong so often that their theory has become debased.
The new adherents -- who range from senior Western oil-company executives to current and former officials
of the major world exporting countries -- don't believe the global oil tank is at the half-empty point. But they
share the belief that a global production ceiling is coming for other reasons: restricted access to oil fields,
spiraling costs and increasingly complex oil-field geology. This will create a global production plateau, not a
peak, they contend, with oil output remaining relatively constant rather than rising or falling.
The emergence of a production ceiling would mark a monumental shift in the energy world. Oil production has
averaged a 2.3% annual growth rate since 1965, according to statistics compiled by British oil giant BP PLC.
This expanding pool of oil, most of it priced cheaply by today's standards, fueled the post-World War II global
economic expansion.
On Oct. 31, Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of French oil company Total SA, jolted attendees at a
London conference by openly labeling production forecasts of the International Energy Agency, the
sober-minded energy watchdog for industrialized nations, as unrealistic. The IEA projects production will grow
to between 102.3 million and 120 million barrels a day by 2030. Mr. de Margerie said production by 2030 of
even 100 million barrels a day will be "difficult."
This is "the view of those who like to speak clearly, honestly, and [are] not just trying to please people," he
bluntly declared. The French executive said many existing oil fields are being depleted at rates that will
damage their geologic structures, which will limit future output more than most people allow. What's more,
some nations endowed with large untapped pools of oil are generating so much revenue from their current
production that they feel they don't need to further develop their fields, thus putting another cap on output.
Earlier this month, James Mulva, the chief executive of ConocoPhillips, echoed those conclusions in a
speech at a Wall Street conference: "I don't think we are going to see the supply going over 100 million
barrels a day. . . . Where is all that going to come from?" He questioned whether the industry has enough
support services and people to execute projects to add that much oil production.
Even some officials from member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has
long insisted on its ability to supply the world with fuel for decades hence, are breaking ranks and forecasting
limits. The chairman of Libya National Oil Corp. said at the same London conference the world will have
difficulty producing more than 100 million barrels a day.

--- Page 181 ---

A former head of exploration and production at Saudi Arabia's national oil company, Sadad Ibrahim Al
Husseini, has also gone public with doubts. He said in London last month that he didn't believe there were
enough engineers or equipment to ramp up production fast enough to keep up with the thirsty global
economy. What's more, he said, new discoveries are tending to be smaller and more complex to develop.
Many leaders of the industry still dismiss the idea that there is reason to worry. "I am no subscriber to the
theory that oil supplies have already peaked," said BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, earlier this month in
a speech in Houston.
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Rex Tillerson has said that if companies had better access to the world's
oil reserves, production would increase and prices would go down. "Sufficient hydrocarbon resources exist to
play their role in meeting this growing global demand, if industry is allowed to access them," he said in a
speech this month. If access were granted, Exxon Mobil believes the industry would be able to raise fuel
production to meet demand in 2030 of 116 million barrels a day.
The oil industry has long been beset by doom-and-gloom scenarios, which so far haven't panned out. "The
entire oil industry in the late 1970s was convinced the price [of oil] would be $100 by 1990 and we would
need huge oil shale mines" to exploit oil locked away tightly in rock, says Michael C. Lynch, president of
Strategic Energy &Economic Research Inc. Of course, that didn't happen, as discoveries ushered in new eras
of low-priced oil in the mid-1980s through the late 1990s.
U.S. government experts are optimistic -- to a point. The Energy Information Administration, the data arm of
the Energy Department, forecasts world oil production will hit 118 million barrels a day by 2030. But the
agency warns that its prediction might not pan out if resource-rich nations such as Venezuela and Iraq don't
invest enough in their operations.
"We know that the world is not running out of energy resources, but nonetheless, above-ground risks like
resource nationalism, limited access and infrastructure constraints may make it feel like peak oil just the
same, by limiting production to something far less than what is required," said Clay Sell, deputy secretary of
energy, in a speech in October. Resource nationalism refers to tightening state control of oil fields to achieve
political aims, often by restricting outsiders' ability to develop the oil for world markets.
Two or three years ago, it was far more common for oil analysts and officials to trumpet the potential of new
technology to harvest more oil. In a report last year, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a prominent
adviser to energy companies, made the comforting prediction that oil production could reach 110 million
barrels a day by 2015, and "more than meet any reasonable high growth rate demand scenario we can
envisage" up to that date. Because of progress being made in extracting oil through new methods, CERA
said it found "no evidence" there would be a peak in oil flows "any time soon." In a later report, CERA said
world oil production won't peak before 2030 and that even when it does, production will resemble an
"undulating plateau" for one or more decades before declining gradually.
Oil companies have seen several years of bull-market prices, and thus of trying to produce more. This has
given their executives a better sense of what is and isn't possible.
One limit: Many people think most of the world's giant fields already have been discovered. By 1970,
oil-industry explorers had discovered 10 giants that could each produce more than 600,000 barrels a day,
according to Matt Simmons, chairman of energy investment banking firm Simmons &Co. International.
Exploration in the next 20 years, to 1990, yielded only two. Since 1990, despite billions in new spending, the
industry has found only one field with the potential to top 500,000 barrels a day, Kazakhstan's Kashagan field
in the Caspian Sea. And Mr. Simmons notes it is proving expensive and difficult to extract.
Big strikes are still possible. This month, Petroleo Brasileiro SA announced a deep-water find off Brazil's
Atlantic coast that appears to be the largest discovery since Kashagan.
But some of the most promising geological formations are in locations that are inhospitable, for reasons of
geography or, especially, politics and strife. Output from Iraq's rich fields is unlikely to grow much until
security improves and outside investment returns. The future of Iranian and Nigerian production is likewise
clouded by geopolitical and local instability.
Labor and construction bottlenecks also are making it difficult to develop proven fields. One of the largest
obstacles is the booming commodity markets themselves: The prices of raw materials used in oil-field
platforms and equipment has escalated. And during the years of low or moderate oil prices in the 1980s and
1990s, companies didn't develop enough geologists and other skilled workers to supply today's needs. "Years
of underinvestment in new talent have led to a limited and aging pool of skilled workers," noted Andrew
Gould, the CEO of oil-service giant Schlumberger Ltd., last month.
High oil prices have also led to steep cost inflation for drilling rigs and other equipment. Costs have soared
so much that the industry is falling behind in the investment needed to sate expected future demand. To meet

--- Page 182 ---
Page 182 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
demand forecasts of 90 million barrels of oil a day in 2010, the industry needed to have spent $350 billion on
drilling and producing in 2005, argues Larry G. Chorn, chief economist of Platts, the energy and
commodities-information division of McGraw-Hill Cos. But the International Energy Agency estimates that
spending on oil-field production in 2005 came to only about $225 billion, he says.
A failure to spend enough in the past few years "may have already put the industry behind the spending
curve," Mr. Chorn says. As a result, he predicts "temporary shortages over several years, causing debilitating
price spikes."
Compounding the problem: Most of the world's biggest fields are aging, and production at them is declining
rapidly. So, just to keep global production at current levels, the industry needs to add new production of at
least four million daily barrels, every year. That need is roughly five times the daily production of Alaska, with
its big Prudhoe Bay field -- and it doesn't assume any demand growth at all.
Mr. Simmons scoffs at estimates that production from proven fields will decline only 4.5% a year. He thinks a
more realistic rate of decline is 8% to 10% a year, especially because modern technology actually succeeds
in depleting fields faster.
If he's right, the industry needs to add new daily production of at least eight million barrels -- 10 times current
Alaskan production -- just to stay even.
Mr. Simmons thinks the world needs to shift its energy focus from climate change to more immediate
concerns. "Peak oil is likely already a crisis that we don't know about. At the furthest out, it will be a crisis in
2008 to 2012. Global warming, if real, will not be a problem for 50 to 100 years," he says.
Oil executives who believe a production ceiling is coming are making plans to stay relevant in a world where
oil production is constrained.
Mr. de Margerie said at Total's annual meeting this spring that the company was "looking into"
nuclear-industry investments and had hired nuclear experts to help make strategic decisions. ConocoPhillips
recently said it was considering building a commercial-scale plant to turn plentiful U.S. coal into natural gas.
Soaring energy prices have breathed new life into projects targeting "nonconventional" oil, such as that
trapped in sand or shale. But these sources can't be tapped nearly as quickly or inexpensively as the big oil
finds of the past.
Canada's massive oil-sands deposits, which hold the largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia's, offer a vivid
example. They contain an estimated 180 billion barrels of oil. But after years of intensive development and
tens of billions of dollars of investments, the sands are producing only a little more than 1.1 million barrels of
crude a day. That's projected to reach three million a day by 2015. The oil deposits are so heavy that
companies must either mine them or slowly steam them underground to get the oil to flow out of the sand.
Randy Udall, co-founder of the U.S. chapter of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, has written
that these unconventional oil supplies are like having $100 million in the bank, but "being forbidden to
withdraw more than $100,000 per year. You are rich, sort of."
As these uncertainties mount, there is growing hope that Saudi Arabia, which has about 20% of the world's oil
reserves, would ride to the rescue if needed. Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, has embarked on an
ambitious plan to increase its daily production by 30%, or three million barrels, early next decade, and thus
reclaim the title of top producer from Russia. But Mr. Al Husseini, the former Saudi oil executive, now an
independent consultant, said others aren't doing as much, leaving the world entirely dependent on Saudi
Arabia to provide extra capacity.
"Everyone thinks that Saudi Arabia will pull us out of this mess. Saudi Arabia is doing all it can," he says in an
interview. "But what it is doing, in the long run, won't be enough."

Investors Go to Treacherous Places Seeking Returns --- Funds Pour Money Into Zimbabwe on the
Theory Mugabe Can't Rule Forever, Nation Will Rebound

Johannesburg, South Africa -- Zimbabwe is an economic nightmare. The annual inflation rate is 8,000% and
rising. People don't have food to eat.
Yet investors have started pouring millions of dollars into the country. Foreign direct investment has
rebounded, reaching $103 million in 2005, up from just $4 million in 2003, according to the most recent
figures available from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
What explains the flood of money? Some investors are betting there's nowhere to go but up. A slump like
Zimbabwe's can't last, and when it's over -- perhaps with the graceful, or otherwise, exit of President Robert
Mugabe, who has presided over a decades-long downward spiral -- the country will rebound.
The race to invest in Zimbabwe also underscores just how far global investors are willing to stretch in search
of decent returns. The turmoil in global credit markets has rippled across emerging economies, boosting
yields for some of the riskiest bets around.
At the same time, in recent years, relatively sluggish returns in many developed markets have sent investors
farther afield.
Africa overall is emerging as a hot destination for money. Amid a global commodities boom, investment
bankers from around the world are flocking to African commercial hubs such as Lagos, Nigeria, and
Johannesburg.
China, in particular, is pouring cash into the continent, investing in oil fields, mines and more recently the
financial sector. Just last month, Industrial &Commercial Bank of China Ltd. said it would spend $5.5 billion
for a 20% stake in South Africa's Standard Bank.
Managers at Imara Holdings Ltd., a Botswana-based investment-banking company, were surprised when
investors started asking this year about Zimbabwe, considering the seemingly better opportunities in the
region, including diamond-rich Botswana and agribusiness-focused Uganda.
Dave Eliot, chief executive of subsidiary Imara Assets Management in South Africa, said he once classified
Zimbabwe as an "emerging market," but has now downgraded it to "frontier" status since the country began
falling apart in the past few years.
"It's gone backwards," he says.
Once known as Rhodesia under white minority rule, Zimbabwe became a democracy in 1980 after a
prolonged guerrilla war. The veteran guerrilla leader, Mr. Mugabe, was elected president, and the new
country became the darling of foreign investors eager to access Zimbabwe's natural resources. Within a
decade, Mr. Mugabe had become corrupt and paranoid, fixing elections, crushing dissent and dragging the
country into economic decline.
Investors are interested anyway. Imara launched a Zimbabwean-focused investment fund in March, hoping to
pull in $10 million by the end of the year. It had $11 million in a few months, mostly from private investors.
John Legat, the fund's manager, estimates most businesses in Zimbabwe are selling at 15% to 20% of their
actual value. In October, Imara said the fund was up 35% in September from the previous month.
Investments include: Zimbabwean fast-food company Innscor Africa Ltd., which also owns a
crocodile-farming business; mining subsidiary Rio Tinto Zimbabwe Ltd.; and Dawn Properties Ltd., which
invests in hotels left over from Zimbabwe's once-flourishing tourism industry centered around the spectacular
Victoria Falls.

Pan-African investment house Lonrho PLC divested itself of its Zimbabwe holdings a few years ago, but now
is getting back in. The London-based company has set up an investment fund targeting Zimbabwe and
neighboring countries. The fund, called LonZim, plans to raise $145 million.
Separately, Lonrho last month snapped up Blueberry International Services Ltd., a company incorporated in
the British Virgin Islands with interests in two Zimbabwean companies -- telecom firm Celsys Ltd., which
specializes in payphones, and Gardoserve Ltd., a chemical maker -- for $5.45 million.
One irony of Zimbabwe's slump is that it is home to some of the richest gold and platinum reserves in the
world. As a result, natural-resource investors -- who are used to operating amid political instability -- are
looking closely at Zimbabwe, too.
South Africa-based Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., which owns two Zimbabwean mining subsidiaries, has
announced plans to expand its operations in the country, and Anglo Platinum Ltd. is planning to build a
120,000-ton-a-month mine, one of its larger projects.
Despite the excitement, Zimbabwe is still one of the world's riskiest bets. Lawmakers recently took steps to
tighten foreign-ownership rules, requiring 51% local ownership of foreign companies there.
It is unclear how -- or even whether -- the bill will be enforced. Still, it worries some observers who see
parallels with Mr. Mugabe's previous land-overhaul program. Starting in 2000, he let squatters violently
overrun the nation's commercial farms (owned mostly by white Zimbabweans), throwing food production into
disarray.
Part of the challenge of investing in Zimbabwe is figuring out how much anything is actually worth, given the
plummeting Zimbabwean dollar.
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe fixes the exchange rate at 30,000 Zimbabwean dollars to the U.S. dollar.
The problem: Zimbabweans don't put much faith in that figure -- if they did, they'd quickly lose all their money.
There is another, presumably more accurate, method of estimating what a Zim dollar is worth. Dubbed the "
Old Mutual Implied Rate," it offers a glimpse of the obstacles to doing business in Zimbabwe.
It is based on the share price of Old Mutual, a British investment company whose stock trades on three
different markets -- London, Johannesburg and Zimbabwe's capital of Harare. Because all Old Mutual shares
are of equal value, it is possible to extrapolate the market value of the Zim dollar by comparing the price of
Old Mutual shares on the different markets.
On Friday, the Old Mutual Implied Rate stood at 2,596,784 Zimbabwean dollars to the U.S. dollar.
Not everyone can stomach that much risk. Navaid Burney, managing director of Washington-based
private-equity firm Emerging Capital Partners, which invests exclusively in Africa, says his fund hasn't made a
move in Zimbabwe yet.
"It doesn't have the feel of Lagos," he says, referring to the crumbling, crime-plagued Nigerian commercial
hub -- which is a bustling boomtown by comparison.

[Today's Market Forecast]
Financials
Are Cheap
For a Reason
Shares of financial firms are traditionally cheaper than other stocks. The past few months show there's a
reason for this.
Banks and brokers have gotten hit so badly by subprime-mortgage troubles that billion-dollar write-downs
now seem commonplace. This week it's been Bear Stearns with a $1.2 billion write-down; Bank of America
with a $3 billion write-down; and HSBC with a $3.4 billion charge.
Turmoil at financial firms isn't new. They make money by taking on and managing risk. Periods of stability
tempt them into taking bigger risks, which is profitable and, besides, everyone else is doing it. As former
Citigroup CEO Charles Prince said in July, "as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance."
In the end it looked less like dancing than musical chairs, and Mr. Prince lost his seat.
Financial firms' risk-taking tendencies make owning their stocks a riskier proposition, hence the lower
valuations. According to Standard &Poor's, financial firms in the S&P 500 index now trade at just 11.6 times
the past four quarter's earnings; the price-to-earnings ratio a year ago was a still-low 13.5. The S&P 500's
overall P/E is 16.4 versus 16.2 a year ago.
If financial firm P/E ratios are down, and the overall P/E is basically unchanged, that means that nonfinancial
firm valuations are higher -- especially since financial firms contribute an outsize quarter of S&P 500
earnings. Excluding financial firms, the index's price-to-earnings ratio is 18.2, compared with 17.2 a year ago.
In other words, while financial stocks have gotten cheaper, the rest of the stock market has gotten more
expensive. That doesn't make great sense with broader economic worries on the rise.
As Gold Goes,
So Go Stocks
The price of gold is slipping. Stocks could be next.
That's not the way it used to work. Gold once moved inversely to stocks. Its rise tended to reflect worries
about inflation, and inflation scared stock investors.
In recent years, gold has become a proxy for the strengthening global economy, reflecting demand in rising
markets such as India and China. One reason: As more families enter the middle class in growing countries,
they turn to gold and jewelry as a status symbol or a store of wealth.
Since the latest bull run began in October 2002, the Dow Jones Global-World Index is up 145%. In the same
period, gold has gained 146%. The rise in gold prices "is all about a strong global economy," says Bianco
Research strategist Howard Simons.
Global growth might be slipping now. Since hitting a 27-year high of $835 an ounce last week, the yellow
metal has dropped more than 6%, falling $27.10 yesterday, one of the steepest drops of the year. During a

stretch in 2006, gold fell 22% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 8%, a sign of how they now tend to
move together.
The long-term trend in gold is up. The recent decline might simply be some profit-taking. But concerns about
the global economy are mounting because of the credit crunch. Gold could be an early warning sign the
concerns are becoming reality.

Inflation, Growth Worries Team Up to Push Dow Down

Inflation, Growth Worries Team Up to Push Dow Down

Investors often worry about slowing economic growth or inflation. Yesterday they worried about both.
The competing concerns took turns spooking the stock market, which suffered a broad pullback as it piled up
losses faster and faster late in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled for a second straight day,
down 120.96 points, or 0.9%, at 13110.05, up 5.2% this year.
Other market measures posted steeper declines, a sign that the broad majority of stocks were getting
hammered more than big multinationals like the blue chips. Nearly 2,600 New York Stock Exchange listed
stocks declined, compared with 723 that advanced.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index closed 19.43 points lower, off 1.3%, at 1451.15, up just 2.3% this
year. Financial stocks took further hits on worries about the credit crunch and the economy. Citigroup fell 4%.
Investors continued to take profits in highflying tech stocks, sending the Nasdaq Composite Index 1% lower,
off 25.81 points, at 2618.51. It is up 8.4% on the year.
At the start of the session, investors focused on inflation. New data from the Labor Department measuring
the monthly rise in retail prices were mostly in line with Wall Street's expectations. The bad news: Wall
Street's expectations were pretty dire, and some experts are increasingly worried about a possible surge in
readings as high as 5% in the months ahead in retail prices, including all items.
"The problem is not that [monthly readings] of inflation are high right now," said Wells Fargo economist
Eugenio Aleman. "The problem is that the long-term trend doesn't look good. We can see that inflation is
coming in the pipeline."
Mr. Aleman believes that a 5% reading of retail-level inflation could be on the way "very soon," up from 3.7%
on an annual basis in October, according to data released yesterday morning. Higher energy prices this year
have driven annualized headline inflation sharply above the core rate -- excluding food and energy -- which
is still at 2%, within the Federal Reserve's "comfort zone" to make rate cuts.
Some Wall Street pros also remain concerned that the long-term rally in crude-oil prices could yet translate
into higher costs for various goods transported over long distances.
If that happens, then core readings would eventually creep up as well and could prompt the Fed to raise
rates, which would increase borrowing costs throughout the economy.
Crude prices have soared more than 50% this year, but the commodity took a breather yesterday afternoon
on the heels of surprisingly robust inventory data from the Energy Information Administration. Oil futures
finished down 66 cents, or 0.7%, at $93.43 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Stock investors' economic focus shifted in the afternoon after Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President
Thomas Hoenig -- who recently cast the lone dissenting vote against a Fed interest-rate cut to spur growth --
expressed new concerns about growth, calling the outlook "uncertain."
Mr. Hoenig noted that housing weakness has led to a slowing in housing-related employment, as well as a
decline in consumer spending financed using home equity.
There was other bad news about consumer spending as J.C. Penney posted a 9.1% decline in third-quarter
earnings and cut its forecasts for the fourth quarter. The stock fell 5.1%.
Gold futures slid $27.10 to $785.90 an ounce. Investors flocked to the haven of Treasury securities, sending
the yield on the two-year note to 3.346%, its lowest level since February 2005.

In major U.S. market action:
Stocks fell. Of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 3.86 billion shares changed hands.
Bonds rose. The benchmark 10-year note was up 29/32 to yield 4.159%. The 30-year bond gained 1 6/32 to
yield 4.534%.
The dollar was mixed. The euro traded at $1.4619, down from $1.4646 late Wednesday, while the dollar fell
against the yen to 110.35 from 111.43 yen.

San Francisco -- In San Francisco, architectural heritage buffs still harass politicians and builders in every
possible way to preserve old buildings they profess to love and prevent new ones they expect to hate from
replacing them.
No one has risen to the defense of the building that stood on the site of our latest star-architect creation, the
San Francisco Federal Building (actually, the third San Francisco Federal Building) at Seventh and Mission,
designed by Thom Mayne of Morphosis in Santa Monica, Calif. (Pritzker Prize 2005). All that stood here
before was an unlamented Greyhound bus depot. There was some grumbling about Mr. Mayne's decision to
ignore its proud neighbor to the east, a heavily rusticated and decorated granite courthouse of 1902-05 (now
home to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals) that has survived two major earthquakes and been lavishly
restored. Mr. Mayne's plaza, at least, gives the old building room to breathe.
The new Federal Building is basically a 240-foot-tall slab with 18 floors, most of them 345 by 65 feet, set far
back on a barren, bollard-protected plaza filled mostly with sand (actually decomposed granite, which is more
ecologically correct). A four-story glass-walled wing that reaches out on the west half-closes the plaza, and a
glass-box cafe stands all by itself in its southeast corner, across from the old courthouse. The unusual
narrowness of the main building's floors was determined by the goal of reducing energy use and the resultant
CO2 emissions. Almost all work stations are placed within reach of natural daylight from floor-to-ceiling
window walls. Natural ventilation is tempted to flow through the skinny floors from north to south. The building
uses almost no air conditioning, except in the first five unwindowed "security" floors. (Actually, most buildings
in this cool city do without it.)
Three goals were set for Mr. Mayne and his associates by their client, the U.S. General Services
Administration. First, the building had to be as clean and energy-efficient as possible, in response to the
demand for "green" or "sustainable" buildings that the global-warming crisis has created. Buildings are among
the greediest consumers of energy and the most prodigal spewers of greenhouse gases, and they can now
be measured against a detailed list of Good Things to Do and Bad Things Not to Do. The U.S. Green Building
Council awards a maximum of 89 points for things like building near bus stops, providing parking for bicycles
rather than cars, conserving or restoring green space (or creating some on the roof), reusing rain water and
waste water (waterless urinals and composting toilets are favored), making use of natural ventilation rather
than air conditioning and daylight instead of electric lighting, using solar or geothermal power, building out of
recycled materials or (better yet) recycling an old building. Any nonrecycled wood used should come from
sustainable forests. Using bamboo, cork and straw wins you points, because they grow back so quickly.
The council offers four levels of approval for what it regards as an environmentally responsible building.
"LEED-certified," the lowest level, requires 36 points out of 89. ("LEED" stands for "Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design.") With 44 points, you're LEED silver; 53, gold; 71, platinum. Since 2000, about 1,100
buildings in the U.S. (not counting homes) have passed muster -- 50 at platinum, 289 at gold, 339 at silver.
San Francisco has 18 LEED-certified buildings, eight of them gold; New York has 11, and seven of them are
gold.
The most important energy-saving features in Mr. Mayne's new building are the sun-shades he has applied to
the long north and south facades, designed to let in desirable daylight but keep out unwanted heat and glare.
On the north, 55 building-high sets of frosted green glass fins are bolted to catwalks outside the glass wall, to
provide shade from the late northern sun. On the more visible, vulnerable south side, a huge screen made of
stainless-steel panels has been tossed over the building, like a sheet over the back of a chair, and allowed to
roll in angular rumples over half of the plaza. Parts of this screen open and close automatically to respond to
changing sunlight and temperature. Mr. Mayne professes not to care about LEED ratings -- after all, those
acres of stainless steel were not dug out of the earth -- but his Federal Building seems likely to win LEED
silver when it officially opens later this year.

A second goal of the GSA was to make the new Federal Building more "worker friendly," by designing it
around the needs and comforts of 1,700 employees. Reversing the usual configuration of office floors, all the
desks next to the glass walls are reserved for the worker-bees, each of whom can open one window just a bit.
Executives are concentrated in glass-walled cabins in the core of the building, over which fresh air can
circulate. Standard elevators stop only at every third floor, forcing most employees to walk up or down a flight
of sheet-steel stairs to get to their destinations. This may be Nanny Mayne's way of making people exercise
(one expects the candy machines to dispense carrot sticks), but it is also intended to encourage "interaction"
among people passing on the stairs or lingering on landings in front of big box-framed windows on the south
facade.
A third major consideration in the design was to make it "connect" to the surrounding community. Hence the
cafe on the corner (open to all, except perhaps the homeless who still congregate here); a semi-underground
child-care center with its own outdoor playground; and conference rooms in the basement that can be rented
by community groups. The plaza, with its barren sandpit, bunker-benches and ubiquitous security cameras, is
probably better suited to protest demonstrations than casual lunch breaks.
From the 11th floor to the 13th, a square hole has been poked through the building -- an idea lifted from a
sleek 25-year-old condo by Architectonica in Miami, which did it better. This provides views over low-rise
buildings to an edge of the bay at the south, and an impressive vista of San Francisco's elegant Civic Center
just a few blocks away to the north. From this angle, you can see the original neo-classical Federal Building
of 1936 and the dull modernist facade of Fed II of 1963, the latter of which still houses most of the city's
federal courts and offices. (Fed III is used by the departments of Labor, Agriculture, Health and Human
Services and Transportation; the Social Security Administration occupies the west wing.) This "Sky Garden"
-- still a bit bleak when I visited -- is open to members of the public, after they pass a security check in the
lobby. Of course, the gray slab that provides these views now blocks the views of people in the buildings you
are looking at.
Very few people other than employees or their clients ever get to see the interiors of office buildings, private
or public. But we are all obliged to look at the outsides of such buildings, especially when they are built in
such a central location as San Francisco's new Federal Building. People looking south from Civic Center now
have their view stopped by its greenish north face. Some 175,000 vehicles a day pass on Interstate 80
alongside the southern front, which is punctured by square holes and strangely tilted on top. As you drive in
the city to or from the Bay Bridge, it rises up like a quirky, oversized drive-in movie screen.
John King, the San Francisco Chronicle's astute urban design critic, has defended this strange building from
the start, partly because of its strangeness. Whether you like it or not, he has written, the building matters
because of its novelty, its daring, its potential to shake San Francisco out of its smug sense of
self-satisfaction. But for all of its trumpeted contributions to green building, community outreach and
employee welfare, the building most people will see is ultimately the product of one architect's own
self-indulgence -- mainly in the bland gray steel scrim that is thrown over the south side of the building,
curling over the top like an Elvis flip, then crumpling into meaningless, decorative folds over the day-care
center and cafe, where it is supported on needlessly large triangular props.
Only in the long, soaring main lobby, propped up by six colossal concrete columns that lean against a wall
inset with glazed light boxes like open drawers, does the building inspire. Best of all, I think, is the view from
the far end of the lobby, over an open pit that looks down to the basement. Here the intricate stone carving of
the 1905 courthouse is framed by one huge jagged, triangular window.

Small-capitalization stocks fell as fears of a chastened U.S. consumer returned to the market, even as muted
inflation data tempered other worries.
In particular, shares of clothiers and other stores were weak after the Commerce Department reported that
retail sales growth eased in October from the September pace. Stein Mart slipped 71 cents, or 9%, to $7.18;
Tuesday Morning fell 69 cents, or 8.4%, to 7.54.
"You've got housing, you've got energy costs; with all these things weighing on the consumer, I don't see any
reason [for consumer stocks to rise] in the short term other than the type of short-covering rally" the market
had Tuesday, said Bradford Evans, a portfolio manager at value investor Heartland Advisors.
The retail-sales data also weighed on the dollar. Commodity futures -- which have developed an inverse
correlation to the dollar -- rose and took mining and materials issues with them. Among gold miners, Golden
Star Resources rose 25 cents, or 8%, to 3.38; and Vista Gold tacked on 10 cents, or 1.7%, to 5.95, both on
the American Stock Exchange. Among other materials issues, metals processor OM Group rose 5.63, or
12%, to 51.23 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Russell 2000 index of small caps declined 6.69 points, or 0.85%, to 782.47; and the S&P SmallCap 600
fell 3.63, or 0.89%, to 404.28. Both slipped back into negative territory for the year to date.
Daktronics plunged 8.68, or 30%, to 19.89. The maker of baseball scoreboards and digital billboards posted
second-quarter profit short of forecasts.
Nastech Pharmaceutical jumped 92 cents, or 19%, to 5.79 after the biotechnology concern approved the
spinoff of a unit focused on "RNA-interference" genetic research.
ArvinMeritor rose 20 cents, or 1.6%, to 12.77 on the NYSE as the auto-parts supplier projected improved
earnings next year.
Bois D'Arc Energy dropped 3.37, or 15%, to 19.19 on the NYSE after the Houston oil-and-natural-gas driller
said it couldn't find a buyer because of conditions in the financing market, and concluded a search for
alternatives.
Bois D'Arc shareholder, large-capitalization concern Comstock Resources, fell 3.61, or 10%, to 32.80 on the
NYSE.

Interest Rates And Dollar Fundamentals

Is the dollar down or is the euro up? It is the same thing viewed from different sides, of course. Yet the topic
is too often viewed from just one side. Looking at the dollar alone, many economists blame the Fed for
lowering interest rates. Viewed from the other side, however, one might wonder why other central banks
have not lowered their interest rates.
Rising currencies are not necessarily a sign of strength. The U.S. dollar rose sharply before and during the
recession of 2001. The trade-weighted index of the dollar's value against 26 currencies rose 10.5% from
March 2000 to January 2002, as the stock market and economy tumbled.
A graph in the Aug. 5-11 issue of The Economist showed that, "countries whose currencies have gained most
[against the dollar] are high interest-rate economies, such as Turkey, Brazil and New Zealand, commodity
producers, such as Canada, or a mixture of both, such as Australia."
Central-bank interest rates are 16.75% in Turkey, 11.25% in Brazil, 8.25% in New Zealand, 6.75% in
Australia and 5.75% in the U.K. High interest rates may prop up a currency for a while by attracting
international "hot money." But super-high interest rates, like those in Turkey and Brazil, are typically a
symptom of inflation-prone monetary policy, requiring a high risk premium to bribe investors to hold that
country's IOUs. In any case, high interest rates are certainly not something most Americans would envy or
hope to emulate.
The spectacular rise of the Canadian dollar was more closely tied to the price of oil than to interest rates,
although the Bank of Canada did raise interest rates in July, just before the Fed began nudging rates down.
While prices of oil and gold were soaring, exporters of oil and gold such as Canada could trade their wares
for more U.S. technology and services. Such improved "terms of trade" typically raise the global demand for
the assets of commodity-producing countries and thereby raise their currencies.
Other commodity exporting countries, such as Australia and to some extent the U.K., also see their
currencies rise whenever the price of their exports rises faster than the price of their imports. Trade deficits
have nothing to do with it. Australia's current account deficit is a bit larger than that of the U.S., as a share of
GDP, and Britain's deficit is not much smaller.
Currencies of commodity exporters likewise fall when commodity prices fall. When the price of oil fell in early
1986, late 1998 and 2001, the Canadian dollar fell substantially, even though central-bank interest rates
were higher in Canada than in the U.S.
Many currency and commodity traders have recently made leveraged bets that prices of oil and gold could
only go higher, but the expression "trees don't grow to the sky" does not just apply to stocks.
What about the euro? Interest rates set by the European Central Bank (ECB) are now about the same as in
the U.S. But that is something quite new. In June 2006, the euro discount rate was only 3.75% while ours was
6%. Today, they are both at 5%.
Until recently, the ECB had pegged its interest rate on "main refinancing operations" (MRO) as much as 2.25
percentage points below the equivalent U.S. fed-funds rate. That gap between U.S. and euro interest rates
widened in 2005 and early 2006. Unsurprisingly, the euro then fell to 1.195 per dollar from November 2005 to
March 2006 -- down 16% from its level at the end of 2004.
The Fed stopped raising rates after June 2006, but the ECB continued to push rates higher. As a result, the
gap between U.S. and euro interest rates first narrowed and then vanished as the Fed eased.
Unsurprisingly, the euro rose.

--- Page 195 ---
Page 195 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The euro's recent rise involved betting on the expectation that the Fed will soon cut interest rates again, but
also that the ECB will not follow suit. Yet the ECB has always followed the Fed's interest-rate moves, albeit
quite slowly. The ECB did not begin reducing rates until May 2001 -- five months later than the Fed. And the
ECB did not put rates above 2% until December 2005 -- a year later than the Fed.
In past episodes of rising oil prices -- 1974, 1980 and 2000 -- all major central banks raised interest rates in
unison. That always ended in a world recession, which was belatedly followed by deep cuts in central bank
interest rates. After the oil spike of August-November 1990, when the fed-funds rate was above 8%, the Fed
failed to reduce interest rates significantly until a year after the recession ended.
Those calling for higher central-bank interest rates when oil prices rise should realize that such policies
have, in the past, resulted in interest rates of 1%-2% two or three years later (arguably too low and too late),
after global industrial slumps slashed the price of oil.
This time, the Fed was first to jump off that rusty old bandwagon, unilaterally. That obviously affected
exchange rates. However, this does not necessarily mean other central banks have been pursuing a wiser
course.
There are two sides to every exchange rate. Perhaps it is time for the other side -- notably, the central banks
of Europe, Canada and the U.K. -- to take their turn at reducing interest rates, even if the Fed sits this one
out.

How Investors Bet on Civil War

Think handicapping Ben Bernanke's next move is tough? Imagine trying to place market bets on Robert E.
Lee's fate 150 years ago.
That is what a pair of economists have tried to re-enact in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper.
Using the prices of Confederate bonds that traded in Europe during the Civil War, the economists -- Marc
Weidenmier of Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif., and Kim Oosterlinck of Solvay Business
School in Brussels -- retraced how European investors judged the odds of Confederate victory in the latter
years of the conflict.
Their conclusion may come as a surprise to those historians that assume the North's industrial might virtually
guaranteed a victory in the 1861-1865 war.
"European investors gave Johnny Reb approximately a 42% chance of victory," until the South's defeat at
Gettysburg in July 1863 sent Confederate victory futures plummeting, the economists wrote.
Civil War re-enactments have become something of a cottage industry in recent years, especially in the
South, where much of the war was fought. Re-enactors go to great lengths to re-create conditions in the
1860s. Messrs. Weidenmier and Oosterlinck's re-enactment takes place not in the fields of Virginia, but the
trading exchanges of Amsterdam.
Messrs. Weidenmier and Oosterlinck based their estimates on prices of Confederate gold bonds that traded
in Amsterdam.
The South sold bonds in Europe to raise gold for the war effort, according to the authors, and frequent price
quotes in Dutch financial papers suggest the debt was actively traded.
These days financial markets price in expectations of future events all the time in markets for gold, oil,
commodities, stocks, even future Federal Reserve decisions. But financial markets weren't as developed 150
years ago, and news didn't travel quite as fast.
Still, "by nineteenth century standards, this was a liquid market for a sovereign debt issue," the economists
wrote.
In order to use bond prices as a proxy for Southern victory, the economists assumed the North would pay off
none of the debt in the event of a Southern defeat, while the Confederacy would have fully honored the debt
had it won the war.
Because the Confederate debt market wasn't actively trading when the South had key early victories, at some
point European markets might have priced in higher than a 42% chance of a Southern victory.
The biggest weekly decline in the probability of a Southern victory came after its defeat in Chattanooga,
Tenn., in late 1863, the authors said. It also declined when the U.S. government informed its embassies that
the South had little chance of winning -- rather like fed-funds futures dropping when officials say they plan on
keeping inflation low.
The biggest weekly rise in the chances of a Southern victory came in late 1863 on rumors of peace talks
between the North and South -- the 19th-century equivalent of fed-funds futures rising on rumors of an
intermeeting rate cut.
The string of Northern victories led to a steady decline in investor odds of a Confederate win, and by the time
President Lincoln was re-elected in 1864 "financial markets considered a Southern victory a low probability
event," the authors wrote.

Oil Is Farther From $100 --- Broader Pressures Relax World-Wide; A Return to $90?

Oil Is Farther From $100 --- Broader Pressures Relax World-Wide; A Return to $90?

Crude oil prices fell sharply on forecasts of slower-than-expected world oil demand growth and the expiration
of options.
The fall startled traders, who last week had come close to pushing the benchmark oil contract to $100 a
barrel. Yesterday oil futures traded as low as $90.13 a barrel, down 9% from the record intraday high of
$98.62 reached last Wednesday. The slide in oil prices came in spite of a weaker dollar, which can lend
support to crude futures. "Last week the question was whether we can touch $100," said Nauman Barakat,
senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA in New York. "This week it's, 'Can we touch $90?' What a
difference a week makes."
Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled down $3.45, or 3.7%, to $91.17 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest closing price since Oct. 30.
Sparking the selloff was a monthly oil-market report from the Paris-based International Energy Agency, the
energy watchdog for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations. The IEA cut its 2007
world oil demand growth forecast to 1.2% from 1.5% in the previous report. The IEA also cut its oil demand
growth forecast for next year to 2.3% from 2.4%. Soaring prices were assigned some of the blame.
A batch of crude-oil options, including a number with strikes priced at $100, also expired, exacerbating
market volatility and further fueling the decline. Call options gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to
buy crude futures at that price before the end of the day. With yesterday's close, they became worthless. The
fact that the market failed to breach the psychologically important $100 threshold in and of itself has fueled
the volatile fall in prices, traders said.
"Not only is the market not approaching $100, it's being exacerbated by the fact that the December crude
options are expiring," said Peter Donovan, vice president of Vantage Trading in New York.
Also burdening futures prices were comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali Naimi, that the kingdom
didn't foresee a recession in the U.S. and that the world economy remained resilient. Mr. Naimi added that he
was skeptical about claims of worsening tightness in the world's oil markets given that oil stockpiles are
trending around their five-year-average levels. "I believe the latest inventory numbers . . . are in the middle of
the five-year average," he said. "I don't see the tightness that pessimists are talking about."
Mr. Donovan said the comments helped soften crude prices. The Saudis "are concerned about oil prices," he
said. "They don't want to see them go straight up. The further you get away from $100, the more people are
slapped in the face with a dose of reality that this doesn't go straight up."
Potentially alleviating geopolitical tension, Iran has given the U.N. nuclear agency blueprints showing how
to mold uranium metal into the shape of warheads, diplomats told the Associated Press, in an apparent
concession meant to head off the threat of new U.N. sanctions. Analyst Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading Corp. in
Chicago said the development also helped remove support for prices. "It may be another reason why people
are selling oil, hoping a conflict might be avoided," said Mr. Flynn.
In other commodity markets:
GOLD: Prices fell on the Comex division of Nymex, pressured by losses in oil and continued profit taking after
last week's stretch to 27-year highs. Nearby November gold fell $8.60 per troy ounce, to $797.20.

Common Sense: Hold BHP and Let Others Chase Commodities Craze

Common Sense: Hold BHP and Let Others Chase Commodities Craze

Sometimes, a cloud has a silver lining, or should I say a gold, iron or aluminum lining?
Amid last week's market slump, it was no small consolation to be the owner of shares in Rio Tinto, the big
mining concern that I've recommended repeatedly and most recently bought during the summer. Rio Tinto
shares jumped more than 25% on news of a possible takeover bid from rival BHP Billiton, which came
through with a $140 billion offer on Monday. Shares surged to $484 before dropping back and closing
yesterday at $447.25.
Suddenly, I find myself on both sides of a takeover battle, since I own BHP shares, too. I also own Cia. Vale
Rio Doce, the big Brazilian mining concern that could emerge as a rival bidder.
This is an unusual position for me. I've written often about takeovers and arbitrage strategies, most recently in
connection with the Whole Foods acquisition of Wild Oats. For some reason, I've usually owned shares in the
company doing the bidding rather than vice versa. As readers of my M&A playbook well know, shares of
acquiring companies usually drop, while the target's shares soar. It can be both difficult and potentially
rewarding to figure out if the acquiring company's shares represent a bargain. I always thought it would be so
easy if you own shares of the target. You just sit back and cash in the gains.
Now that I'm actually in this position, of course, it doesn't seem so simple.
I'm in no rush to sell Rio Tinto. BHP's current offer is three BHP shares for each RTP share. According to
BHP, this amounts to a 15% premium over Rio Tinto's share price on Nov. 7, a value of approximately $410
for each ADR traded in the U.S. This is far below the $484 RTP reached last week, which may account for
this week's decline. But even if BHP doesn't increase its offer, and no other bidder emerges, the BHP bid has
pretty much set a floor under RTP's share price. The "just say no" defense no longer works, which means that
if Rio Tinto persists in ignoring or rebuffing BHP, it will have to find another scenario to deliver returns to
shareholders. A lower share price will only keep the company in play.
Rio Tinto might consider a counterbid for BHP, or try to rustle up a takeover or merger of its own that would
make it so big as to be prohibitively expensive. But surely CEOs and their investment-banking advisers have
learned by now that tactics that ignore shareholders and serve only to entrench corporate managers are bad
for business.
The bid for Rio Tinto has come at a time when commodities mania is at an all-time high. Now that the art
craze and real-estate bubble are over, and the credit crisis is in full bloom, where is all the world's liquidity
flowing? Into inflation hedges like gold and other commodities. Demand from emerging economies for basic
materials continues to soar.
This seems the ideal time for Rio Tinto to auction off its incredibly rich holdings in an array of precious and
other metals and ores, either to one bidder, like BHP, or by breaking itself into pieces.
I'd be cautious about being a commodities buyer right now. The RTP bid set off a wave of excitement in the
basic-materials sector, with investors rushing into stocks considered vulnerable to similar takeovers. But the
same group of candidates could also be rival bidders, in which case their shares, like BHP's, would likely
decline. I'd let the gold dust settle, so to speak, before making any precipitous investments.
The one exception might be BHP, whose shares have dropped. Is it now a bargain in a sizzling sector? The
danger is that it will overpay, but the potential benefits seem compelling. High-risk investors seeking
commodities exposure might want to buy BHP on further weakness. For the rest of us, there will be plenty of
time to assess the situation.

For now, my advice is to let others chase the commodities craze. I plan to hold my BHP and RTP shares, and
enjoy the show while it lasts.

In China Are Cited

HONG KONG -- Asian stock markets continued their decline into the new week, suggesting that a mix of local
and global storm clouds may hover over the region for a while.
One cloud is the deteriorating U.S. housing market. As long as U.S. home values were rising, the U.S.
consumer had felt emboldened to spend, helping bolster Asian economies and markets. No longer.
In addition, persistent concerns about mortgage-related losses at banks around the world intensified after
Wachovia Corp. reported a $1.1 billion write-down on mortgage-backed securities Friday. Investors expect
more bad news when HSBC Holdings PLC's U.S. consumer-lending business reports its third-quarter
earnings this week.
A host of local factors also kicked in yesterday, from higher bank-reserve requirements in China to the
strengthening yen. Some analysts raised alarms over the potential bursting of an asset bubble that many
market watchers have been predicting as stock prices soared this fall.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index tumbled 3.9%. Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies lost
2.5%, Seoul's Kospi slid 3.4%, and the Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks yuan-denominated Class A
and foreign-currency Class B shares, fell 2.4%.
In Hong Kong and Shanghai, the wider pressures were exacerbated by the Chinese central bank's weekend
raising of the reserves requirement for banks, the ninth increase this year. Beijing's aim -- to cool hot stock
and property markets -- is no shock. But mainland shares have soared so much that such news can combine
with broader fears to spur selling. The Shanghai Composite has skidded 15% since hitting a record on Oct.
16.
In HONG KONG, the Hang Seng Index fell to 27665.73, bringing its percentage loss for November to 12%.
Hong Kong's China Enterprise Index, which tracks Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland Chinese companies,
fell 5.9% to 16656.91, an 18% decline since it hit a record on Oct. 30.
Investors bid down Chinese financial shares, among others. Bank of China shed 3.9% and China
Construction Bank fell 4.3%.
To some analysts, these declines herald the bursting of a bubble, especially with monthly economic figures,
due later this week, expected to show inflation higher on the back of soaring food prices. Lan Xue, head of
China research for Citi Investment Research, says Hong Kong-listed shares in Chinese companies have
gone up "too much too fast" and China's domestic stock market could be "losing momentum."
Still, China's markets have had more than one big decline this year, only to bounce right back, powered by
the nation's economic growth and vast pool of pent-up investor funds. So far, investors have tended to take
the periodic declines in stride. Some say the Chinese market is merely correcting itself after setting a series
of record highs tied in part to the $1.5 billion initial public offering of electronic-commerce portal Alibaba.com
last Tuesday. That stock burst out the gate, ending its first day at 39.50 Hong Kong dollars ($5), almost three
times its offering price -- only to drop sharply the next day. Yesterday, the shares fell again and are down
28% from that first-day close.
Jing Ulrich, head of China research at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong, attributes some of the region's declines
partly to the Japanese yen's rapid rise against the U.S. dollar. Some investors had borrowed in yen to buy
higher-yielding assets and are now looking to unwind those trades.
A stronger yen also eats into the profits of Japan's exporters.

In TOKYO, declines of 3.6% by Honda Motor Co. and 3.4% by Nissan Motor Co. dragged the Nikkei 225 to
its seventh straight decline. The 15197.09 close was the lowest in 15 months.
In SEOUL, concerns about the outlook for Chinese companies weighed on South Korean shipbuilders.
Hyundai Heavy Industries fell 3.6%, and Doosan Heavy Industries &Construction skidded 8%. STX Pan
Ocean, which is also listed on the Singapore exchange, plunged 11% and steelmaker Posco retreated 3.4%.
Traders in Singapore also cited China as the reason for the drop in the benchmark Straits Times Index. The
STI fell 2.5% to 3511.12, its lowest close since Sept. 13.
European Banking Stocks
Rise After Week's Plunge
European banking stocks gained yesterday as investors viewed last week's plunge on credit-crunch fears as
overdone. The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index finished flat at 367.69, as mining and oil stocks tumbled.
In LONDON, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.5% to 6337.9, snapping a three-session losing streak. Barclays
jumped 8.1%, while Royal Bank of Scotland surged 9.2%. Basic resource stocks also headed south as
copper and gold futures fell sharply on the London Metal Exchange. Vedanta Resources plunged 5.3%,
Xstrata lost 4.7% and Antofagasta shed 6%.

Gold Record Is Distant Prospect

Gold Record Is Distant Prospect

Gold made headlines last week by flirting with its 1980 peak price, but the precious metal remains far short of
its inflation-adjusted record -- and probably won't see it soon.
On Friday, gold traded in the cash market at $831.50 a troy ounce, nearing the $850-an-ounce record that 27
years ago was briefly touched. Adjusted for inflation, the 1980 price translates to $2,250 now. Similarly, gold
futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled $2.70 lower at $832.50 Friday, a
mere $40.50 from the January 1980 all-time high for nearby Comex gold. That inflation-adjusted price is
about $2,400.
While a raft of bullish factors have catapulted gold prices just as they did in 1980, analysts said a real-price
peak remains a distant prospect.
A collapse in the dollar, an ailing global economy, higher oil prices and inflation fears, as well as "very
significant" cuts to interest rates and surging investor interest, would all be needed to push gold toward
1980 levels, said Philip Klapwijk, executive chairman of gold consultancy GFMS.
"If you get all of that coming together, then under those circumstances maybe you'd get $2,250 an ounce
taken out," Mr. Klapwijk said. "But I personally think that's unlikely."
Still, some parallels between the current economic climate and that of 1980 can be drawn, analysts say.
Inflationary pressures have once more reared their head, as benchmark crude futures fast approach $100 a
barrel, similar to when the Iranian revolution caused crude prices to double over the year to April 1980, when
U.S. fixed-price crude hit $39.50 a barrel.
The sharp increase in crude prices helped pushed inflation near 15% in the U.S. that year.
However, "it's more a question of concerns than actuality, because if you look at the inflation numbers you
see at the moment, they're not terrible," said analyst Peter Dixon of Commerzbank.
Also, in 1980, a U.S. recession was just around the corner with the Carter White House exiting and the
Ronald Reagan administration entering.
Mr. Klapwijk said some market watchers see a similar story unfolding, with fears that losses in the global
banking system may be greater than anticipated, curtailing world-wide economic growth.
Analyst Tom Kendall of Mitsubishi Corp. thinks they have it wrong. "On the surface, it's an attractive theory,
but the biggest change you have to factor in today is the position of the Chinese economy on the world stage.
Back in 1980, U.S. [gross domestic product] would have been a larger proportion of global GDP than it is
today," Mr. Kendall said. "That's a huge difference from 1980."
Safe-haven buying buoyed gold prices in 1980 after the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, and Mr.
Klapwijk said some people see a parallel in escalating tension between the U.S. and Iran.
"In 1980 everything was going gold's way . . . [but] if you look at it in real terms, it's still got a way to go," said
economist Jill Leyland of the World Gold Council, adding that further gains were "certainly" a possibility.
Ms. Leyland said the rise of the middle class in China, India and the Middle East is likely to fuel further gains
in prices, but not without a "substantial" correction first.
Indeed, with open interest on the Comex market at record levels and an almost uninterrupted rise in gold
prices since early September, analysts were almost unanimous in expecting prices to fall back. Open interest
is the number of positions outstanding in a market, and large open interest is a sign of liquidity.

"Even at the all-time [nominal] high, I'd be cautious to say that gold can't go significantly higher still," said Mr.
Klapwijk, who added that by this time next year, gold could be trading well above $1,000.

Green Thumb: New Products Make It Easier To Buy Gold

It's getting easier for investors to play the gold boom -- perhaps too easy.
Gold is one of the year's red-hot investments, thanks to the weakening dollar, inflation fears and a credit
crisis that threatens to tip the U.S. economy into a recession. Gold prices touched their highest level since
1980 during the past week -- and even with a decline on Friday, December gold futures prices rose $26.80,
or 3.3%, a troy ounce from the previous week to settle at $832.50 on the Comex division of the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
People typically turn to gold to hedge against a sagging dollar and inflation. Some advisers also recommend
making a small allocation to gold and other commodities to diversify a portfolio, since the performance of
these assets usually doesn't mirror the movement of stocks or bonds.
It used to be that investing in gold was a clumsy and costly process. Investors would buy gold coins and
bars, usually through bullion dealers, and pay storage and transportation costs.
But recently launched products are making it easier for investors to get started. Two exchange-traded funds --
streetTRACKS Gold Shares and iShares Comex Gold Trust -- let individuals buy and sell gold much as they
would a stock, without needing to take physical possession of the stuff.
Investors can also get exposure to gold through the MarketSafe Gold Bullion CD, a five-year certificate of
deposit from EverBank Financial Corp.'s EverBank that guarantees depositors' principal and offers potential
returns equal to the percentage change in the average spot price of gold over the five-year period. The bank
also offers an online account that lets customers purchase gold or silver.
But investing in gold, which is notoriously risky and volatile, isn't for the faint of heart. If the dollar were to
reverse course and strengthen, for example, it would likely cause gold prices to fall.
What's more, gold has risen so far and so fast -- at the end of last year, it was trading at $635 an ounce --
that many observers say it's due for a correction.
The best way for investors to get started is to buy small amounts at regular intervals over time, says John Hill,
director of metals research for Citigroup Inc. He expects gold to climb to $1,000 an ounce over the next
several years.
If you're willing to take on more risk, consider stocks of gold-mining companies, best suited for people who
are "really confident that gold is going to go way up," says Peter Schiff, author of "Crash Proof: How to Profit
from the Coming Economic Collapse." A small price change in gold can be magnified in a company's
earnings, and thus its stock price.
Mutual funds that invest in gold-mining stocks can be a better way to hedge your bets across companies,
although high fund expenses can be an issue. Specialty precious-metals funds are up 36.3% for the year,
making it the fourth-best-performing mutual-fund category, according to Morningstar Inc.

Adam Smith Growls
REVIEW &OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Adam Smith Growls

'The U.S. dollar is the linchpin of not only the American economy but also the world monetary system." Those
words were the lead of an editorial in this newspaper on August 21, 1978, amid the inflation of the 1970s
and the world's last great dollar crisis. Are we watching another such period today? It's not inevitable, but this
week we all got a reminder of what such a thing looks like, and it isn't pretty.
The dollar is "losing its status as the world currency," declared Xu Jian, a middling official at China's central
bank, on Wednesday. "We will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones, and will readjust accordingly."
That was perceived as a threat by China's central bank to diversify its foreign exchange reserves out of
dollars and into other currencies, especially euros. While China later qualified those remarks, the dollar
nonetheless fell again around the globe, stocks plunged, and gold and other traditional inflation hedges rose
to fresh heights.
Meanwhile, French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited Washington and brought a dollar warning of his own.
"The dollar cannot remain someone else's problem," he told Congress. "If we are not careful, monetary
disarray could morph into economic war. We would all be its victims." The Frenchman was referring to the
damage that the dollar's record lows against the euro are doing to Europe's exports, and the potential for a
return to so-called "competitive devaluation," or what used to be called "beggar-thy-neighbor" currency
policies.
- - -
Coming from opposite sides of the world, these are warnings worth heeding. For as our editorial explained 30
years ago, the dollar is far more than a medium of American exchange. It is a reserve currency, held by
central banks the world over, and the core of the monetary system that underpins what has been a
remarkable period of global economic growth. By toying recklessly with dollar devaluation, our policy makers
are also toying with a far larger economic crisis than the current credit problems.
Yet the striking and dangerous fact is that the conventional wisdom in U.S. financial circles has been that the
dollar's fall is in fact beneficial. Wall Street wants easier money to rescue the banks caught in the subprime
crisis, never mind the risks of future inflation and how damaging that can be to stocks. Manufacturers favor a
lower dollar to boost their own exports, never mind how exchange-rate volatility makes a hash of business
planning.
Worst of all are the economists, who should know better but have convinced themselves that the dollar must
fall so that the "trade deficit" can adjust. Some want to give a short-term boost to exports, which they hope
will keep the economy out of recession while housing dips. Others have been preaching trade-deficit doom
for so long that they view a dollar rout as a kind of policy wish fulfillment.
What all of this ignores is why the dollar should fall so precipitously now. The trade deficit is, by accounting
definition, merely the reverse of a capital surplus. To buy something abroad you must get foreign currency.
So the national accounts will show some offsetting transaction, whether borrowing or the sale of assets or
goods. The trade balance isn't a moral verdict on the strength of an economy, but is merely one snapshot in a
constant series of global transactions.
The U.S. has run trade deficits for years and decades when the dollar was strong, most recently in the late
1990s -- a period of legendary prosperity. As long as foreigners want to invest in the U.S., a strong economy
and a trade deficit can co-exist for long periods. It's preposterous to think that millions of foreigners awoke in
the last week and suddenly discovered that the U.S. trade deficit they'd tolerated for years is a crisis.
To understand the dollar's current woes, you have to look elsewhere -- to monetary policy and economic
management. The supply of dollars in the world is ultimately controlled by a single source, the Federal
Reserve. With its aggressive easing in September, and again in late October, the Fed has signaled to the

--- Page 209 ---
Page 209 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
world that it cares more about creating dollars in the hope of limiting U.S. credit problems than it does about
the dollar's value. Investors can see this, and so they are dumping dollars and looking for other assets to
hold. This includes commodities such as gold, which is now at $835 an ounce. The nearby chart from
economist Michael Darda gives a sense of how far the dollar has fallen this year.
The world can also hear the silence from U.S. economic officials, whom they have come to believe are
content with the dollar's decline. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson mouths the ritual lines about a strong
dollar, even as he keeps pressuring China to revalue the yuan. Otherwise he is missing in action. Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke yesterday told Congress that inflation remains a risk, which shows that he at least
has noted this week's dollar rout. But his previous actions have left him and the Fed with a growing credibility
problem that is perilous for any central banker.
- - -
Our current financial woes are in large part the result of previous monetary excess, which fueled a debt and
asset boom that has become a banking bust. The way to emerge from the mess is to slowly but honestly
work off the bad debt and write down the losses. The one sure way to make things worse is with more
monetary excess. That could trigger a run on the dollar and the necessity for far higher interest rates to stem
it.
But don't take our word for it. Listen to Adam Smith, who this week has been growling in the distance, ready
to enforce his own very rough form of market discipline if the Fed doesn't listen.

Lifelines for the Drowning Dollar

Dollar weakness is neutralizing the positive effects of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts. As the dollar
spirals downward, weakened by Washington's indifference and market expectations of more rate cuts,
liquidity drains from the U.S. into inflation hedges like gold and, in the case of entrepreneurship and
risk-taking capital, to countries with strengthening currencies. This drain undercuts the growth impact of the
Fed's recent rate cuts, complicating the recovery from the August credit-market turbulence. Question: What's
harder to sell than a complex loan during a credit crunch? A dollar-denominated one.
Foreign countries are suffering the opposite phenomenon. Global investors want to buy more in
strong-currency countries, heating up those countries' economies, land values and stock markets. If their
central banks hike rates, as China has been doing and Australia did on Nov. 7, it invites even more capital
inflows in search of higher yields and currency appreciation, reinforcing the upward currency spiral.
Europeans, Canadians and others revel in their wealth relative to Americans. It's their chance to grow their
risking-taking capital base, set global standards, and begin to dominate geopolitical issues. But
ever-strengthening currencies run risks as well, as the U.S. found in the economic boom/recession cycle of
the late 1990s, when stock prices were bid higher despite declining profits.
The U.S. should stop the currency rollercoaster. Other countries would applaud. On Nov. 8, the head of
Europe's central bank called the euro's upward spiral "brutal." It's never been clear to them why the U.S.
wanted a super-strong dollar in the 1990s, at the expense of global deflation, and now wants a super-weak
dollar, driving innovation away from the U.S. and enriching our competitors.
The Bush administration frequently repeats the Clinton-Rubin policy position that "a strong dollar is in our
national interest." By any measure, though, the dollar has weakened steadily under this administration's
policies. The impression is that the "strong dollar" phrase is a throw-away, or worse, cover for a weak-dollar
policy.
Currency momentum can be broken. The dollar wouldn't be hard to strengthen if the Treasury included dollar
weakness in G-7 discussions, and the Fed singled out dollar weakness as a concern. Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke passed up an opportunity to change the dollar's direction in his testimony yesterday to Congress's
Joint Economic Committee, noting mildly that the rise in the price of oil and other commodities, and weakness
in the dollar, "were likely to increase overall inflation in the short run and, should inflation expectations
become unmoored, had the potential to boost inflation in the longer run as well."
The Fed's in a good position if it wanted to strengthen the dollar. By cutting rates well before economic
weakness, it has room to express stronger interest in the dollar's recovery even if that comes across as
hawkish. A clearer preference for dollar strength would increase the demand for dollars, breaking the
weak-dollar momentum without requiring currency intervention or rate hikes. As the dollar strengthens, capital
would return to the U.S., providing extra liquidity and making the Fed's stimulus job easier.
Answering a question at the Economic Club of New York on Oct. 15, Mr. Bernanke said: "No central banker
can be entirely indifferent to the exchange value of the currency of their country and we certainly will pay
attention to that issue." But the formal statement accompanying the Fed's Oct. 31 rate cut was careful not to
mention the dollar in the inflation discussion: "Recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among
other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation."
The market's view is that the Fed has been proactive in providing liquidity but less so in creating conditions to
keep it in the U.S. With gold topping $830 per ounce and the once-meek euro now weighing in at $1.47, it's
simply not clear whether the Fed envisions any bounds to the dollar's slide.
Adding to the dollar's latest sell-off, the Oct. 19 G-7 statement said the group's finance ministers "reaffirm that
exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals." Rather than "reflecting economic fundamentals,"

--- Page 211 ---
Page 211 of 225 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
which are code words for the acceptance of instability, currencies should be "strong and stable" in order to
create good fundamentals for private-sector growth.
The market's clear reaction to Washington's reliance on "fundamentals" has been to sell the dollar on the
view that U.S. economic fundamentals are bad and getting worse. The communique pointedly left out any
confidence-building phrases -- like the one in the 1992 G-7 statement that "the ministers and central bank
governors . . . will take appropriate additional actions as needed to achieve sustained growth and greater
currency stability."
Some argue that dollar weakness helps the economy by making our goods, workers and houses cheap
enough for foreigners to buy or hire. This hasn't worked in practice because investors are momentum
oriented -- they want assets that are going up, not down. The weaker the dollar in recent years, the more
quickly capital has flowed out -- to emerging markets, commodities and foreign real estate. Cheap is
assumed to become cheaper when a currency is weakening.
While the U.S. trade deficit has declined some over the last year, most of that reflects the U.S. housing bust --
home-building is import-intensive -- and the foreign economic boom. The trade deficit is likely to remain wide
regardless of the dollar's value. It reflects a huge demographic differential -- our major trading partners are
aging much faster than we are, requiring them to save more while building and importing less.
Prolonged dollar weakness creates a multitude of problems. Companies have to devote an increasing portion
of their time and energy to currencies rather than their operating business. Foreigners, not always friends, are
gaining wealth relative to Americans. Rather than making the U.S. more competitive, the dollar's weakness
makes it harder to justify investments in the U.S., where growth is slowing and interest rates are higher than
in Europe or Japan to compensate for the weakening dollar. The investment killer is that assets in the U.S.
keep losing value in foreign-currency terms, so U.S. opportunities have to be significantly better to entice
investment in the face of a weakening dollar.
This doesn't mean the Fed was wrong in its Sept. 18 and Oct. 31 interest-rate cuts. By 2007, the Fed
probably didn't have the option of undoing its 2003-2005 mistake of keeping interest rates too low too long --
the inexplicable "measured" hikes from a 1% interest rate during a U.S. and global boom. The damage in
terms of dollar weakness, the housing bubble and credit market distortions was substantial, and the Fed's
rate-cutting action appropriately lowered the recession risk.
The goal now should be to create the best future environment for growth. Alan Greenspan's new book
conveys a long-term pessimism about the value of the dollar in an entitlement-heavy society. That should be
addressed. The remedy is clear -- a new "strong and stable" dollar policy, personal accounts for Social
Security, productivity improvements in medical care, and confidence in low future tax rates to restore growth
and invite investments in dollar-denominated assets.

Why Fed Expects Growth to Slow --- Bernanke Says Credit Fears Are Growing as Oil, Dollar Threaten to Fuel Inflation

Why Fed Expects Growth to Slow --- Bernanke Says Credit Fears Are Growing as Oil, Dollar Threaten
to Fuel Inflation

The Federal Reserve's balancing act between weakening growth and rising prices is getting tougher. Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke said that since the Fed reduced short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage
point to 4.5% a week ago, concerns about credit-market strains have intensified while rising oil prices
threaten to fuel inflation and put "further restraint on economic activity."
Mr. Bernanke's testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress yesterday echoed the Fed's
statement last week that it saw the risks of economic weakness and higher inflation as roughly balanced, a
signal it thought no more rate cuts would be needed.
Since then, stocks have sunk on worries about the prospect of bigger mortgage-related write-offs by banks
and other financial institutions. That has renewed expectations the Fed will cut rates, perhaps as soon as its
Dec. 11 meeting. That expectation has contributed to a weakening of the dollar, which tends to fall when U.S.
interest rates decline while foreign rates are steady or rising, and put upward pressure on oil, gold and other
commodity prices.
Whether the Fed does decide to cut rates depends on if it agrees with the market's forecast that financial
turmoil means the economy will be even weaker than the Fed's already subdued forecast.
Data since last week's meeting still "suggest that the overall economy remained resilient in recent months,"
Mr. Bernanke said. The third-quarter annualized gross domestic product growth rate of about 4% showed
"scant evidence of spillovers from housing" to the broader economy.
He said the Fed's policy committee sees growth slowing "noticeably" in the current quarter and remaining
"sluggish during the first part of next year" but "then strengthening as the effects of tighter credit and the
housing correction began to wane."
Mr. Bernanke played down the threat to consumers' spending from their decreased ability to borrow against
home values, citing the greater importance of overall wealth, which hasn't declined. Moreover, he added, "to
the extent labor markets remain reasonably strong and employment and income continue to grow, that's a
positive." Adding evidence to that case, the Labor Department said yesterday that the number of initial claims
for unemployment insurance fell 13,000 last week to 317,000, the lowest level in a month.
Still, the Fed chief also said that "financial market volatility and strains have persisted" and that investor
concerns have "intensified . . . about credit market developments and the implications of the downturn in the
housing market for economic growth." He predicted that over the next year, 450,000 subprime mortgages
each quarter will see interest rates reset, boosting monthly mortgage payments. A resulting jump in
foreclosures could drive down surrounding property values, "weaken the already struggling housing market
and thus, potentially, the broader economy."
Underscoring the delicacy of current circumstances, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged inflation risks from oil as
well as the weaker dollar, saying the Fed is "very attentive" to the risk that the falling dollar has "the potential
to raise import prices and contribute to inflation."
Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican, told Mr. Bernanke that he was "delighted you're in that job and
I'm not."

Markets Tumble As Dollar's Fall Adds to Anxiety
Markets Tumble As Dollar's Fall Adds to Anxiety

The credit crisis sparked by mortgage problems reared its head anew, as stocks tumbled on fears about
shaky financial institutions. This time, the dollar's fall to record lows and oil's flirtation with $100 a barrel
added to the worrisome brew.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 360.92 points, or 2.64%, to 13300.02. The index has now wiped out all
of its gains since the Federal Reserve on Sept. 18 made the first of its two recent interest-rate cuts, sparking
a short-lived rally that sent the Dow to a record high Oct. 9.
Wall Street is once again nervous about how much damage remains from subprime mortgages and other bad
credit, even after tens of billions of dollars in write-downs. The wave of credit-rating downgrades on mortgage
securities continued yesterday, and bank shares were especially hard-hit. Shares of Washington Mutual Inc.,
a major lender, lost 17%, and after the market closed American International Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley
reported new write-downs connected to housing problems.
Something else is beginning to nag at investors. The dollar and oil are pushing to opposite extremes, one to
record lows and the other near record highs. Gold, an age-old refuge in times of financial turmoil, is once
again above $800 an ounce. The combination of economic worries and market movements is reminiscent of
the chaotic 1970s, when the U.S. was beset by inflation, recession and a stock market going nowhere.
The global economy is much different today than it was then. Inflation is generally under control, and most
investors trust central banks to keep it that way. The U.S. economy, though slowing, has kept growing even
as higher energy prices hit consumers.
Still, the parallel points to some challenges that policy makers are trying hard to manage. One is the threat of
inflation. Another is the risk of a broad international loss of confidence in America and its currency, which
has long been the place where countries with big foreign reserves put the bulk of their assets.
"This is a critical juncture," said Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research at Goldman Sachs. "The dollar
is behaving in the past couple of days as though the market is testing its reserve-currency status."
On Wednesday, the dollar took a sharp turn lower against several major currencies, sliding to a new record
low against the euro and hitting its lowest level in decades versus the Canadian dollar. One dollar now buys
only about 93 Canadian cents. At one point in 2000, the euro was worth only 85 cents. Now one euro buys
$1.46.
One spark behind the dollar's latest downturn was a comment by a Chinese lawmaker suggesting that the
country should buy more euros. Although the lawmaker isn't responsible for financial policy and later
amended the remark, the comment fueled pessimism about the dollar's prospects amid slowing U.S.
economic growth.
The price of oil, meanwhile, is pushing toward $100 a barrel, a price that just a few years ago most
economists agreed could fuel a nasty recession. Strong demand from developing countries, constrained
supplies around the world and speculative pressure are joining to push it higher. And gold closed yesterday
at $831 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its highest level since 1980, as investors sought its
perceived protection against inflation.
The combination of movements in the dollar, oil and gold was similar in the 1970s. Back then, the dollar
became unhinged after President Nixon abandoned the gold standard and the global system for regulating
exchange rates collapsed with it. That was one factor behind oil's rise during that decade. Because oil is
traded in dollars, exporters were earning less in other currencies for every barrel, and had a big incentive to
restrict supply to drive up prices.

The world is far different today. The 1970s were wracked by recession and double-digit inflation. Today,
strong global growth is a major force pushing the price of oil and the dollar in opposite directions. Central
banks are acutely aware of the danger posed by inflation, and declare their readiness to move quickly to
combat it. U.S. consumer prices in October were up 2.8% from a year earlier.
"Economies are much more resilient and much less prone to a creeping inflation process," says Eric
Chaney, an economist at Morgan Stanley in London.
Fears of a falling currency were likely a factor when the Fed signaled last week, at the time of its latest
interest-rate cut, a reluctance to cut rates again. The dollar's decline "could lead to higher prices for imported
goods," Fed governor Kevin Warsh said yesterday. "If these same forces cause inflation expectations to
become less reliably anchored, then inflation could increase in the longer run as well."
So far, the dollar's decline has benefited U.S. exporters by making their goods cheaper abroad and boosting
the value in dollars of money earned overseas. That has helped lift the share prices of many multinationals.
Taken too far, however, a dollar slide could hurt stocks broadly, if investors become unwilling to hold U.S.
dollar assets.
"If you get a dollar rout and people start dumping quickly, that will complicate monetary policy and
undermine the Goldilocks scenario that investors are hanging on to," said Russ Koesterich, head of
investment strategy at Barclays Global Investors.
George Magnus, a senior economic adviser at UBS AG, notes some echoes of the past in the way some
international investors are treating the dollar. Back in the 1970s, Germany and Japan, which had supported
the dollar, tried to demand gold in exchange for their burgeoning reserves.
Today it's oil-producing countries and emerging economies like China that find themselves sitting on
mountains of dollar reserves that are losing value. Some are looking to diversify their reserves, for instance
by creating sovereign wealth funds that turn those dollars into other real assets. China has purchased a stake
in Blackstone Group, the private-equity firm. "Some of the storylines are the same but the characters are
obviously different," says Mr. Magnus.
As before, a sliding dollar gives oil exporters an incentive to keep prices high to avoid eroding their own
purchasing power, although the major causes of high oil prices are soaring demand and constrained supply
as key producer nations are unable to raise output.
The dollar's swoon means that consumers in different parts of the world don't feel the same pain. Since the
start of 2003, oil prices in dollars have tripled, but in euro terms, they have a little more than doubled.
Some economists fret about a vicious cycle in which Persian Gulf countries put more of their oil earnings into
the euro and other currencies, which drives down the dollar and leads the oil producers to keep a tighter
leash on production. That drives up oil prices and brings in even more money for the countries to convert into
nondollar currencies.
Some analysts say oil markets have attracted investors specifically looking for a hedge against the rapidly
falling dollar. "The perception is that you want to own whatever benefits from the dollar weakening. And
commodities are an ideal play on that," says Ben Dell, an energy analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &Co.
John Taylor, head of FX Concepts, a New York-based hedge fund that specializes in currency trading, was a
foreign-exchange analyst in 1970s. Then, he says, the U.S. was also struggling with budget deficits due to
war spending and with a spike in commodity prices. One advantage the dollar enjoyed in the 1970s was that
the U.S. still saved more than it spent. Now the country depends on foreign money to finance its debt, which
could keep the dollar under pressure.
But Mr. Taylor is also more optimistic about the ability of leading governments to coordinate action to stop the
dollar's slide if needed. The Group of Seven developed nations, which had its first meetings in the 1970s, has
built three decades of experience responding to currency gyrations.

The dollar spiraled further down against the euro and the pound, despite mixed euro-zone data, on investor
pessimism about the U.S. credit crunch.
The euro reached a high against the dollar yesterday morning, climbing to $1.4571, just as sterling hit above
$2.09, a 26-year high.
"If the barriers were there, they're now gone," said Chris Furness, senior currency strategist at economics
consultancy 4Cast in London.
Against the yen, the dollar was up slightly on the day.
Late yesterday in New York, the euro was at $1.4554 from $1.4471 late Monday, while the dollar was at
114.71 yen from 114.52 yen. The euro was at 166.94 yen from 165.72 yen. The British pound was at $2.0870
from $2.0811. The dollar was quoted at 1.1453 Swiss francs from 1.1537 francs.
Even mixed euro-zone data, including weaker retail sales and German factory orders released yesterday, did
little to relieve the dollar, similar to dollar-positive data last week. Currency investors are also keeping the
European Central Bank meeting tomorrow in mind.
The ECB is likely to leave its interest rates on hold, one week after the Federal Reserve cut rates. The
central banks' divergent paths and U.S. economic uncertainty spell out a clear route for the dollar in the near
term, analysts say -- downward. That helped the euro soar beyond its previous synthetic high extrapolated
from historical dollar-Deutsche mark levels.
Overnight, the yen was struck by data that suggested the Japanese economy is on the brink of reversal and
will put further pressure on the Bank of Japan to keep rates unchanged at 0.50%.
That helped improve risk appetite and investors resumed carry trades, in which the yen is sold to fund the
purchase of higher-yielding assets, which bumped up the dollar versus the yen.
Separately, surging prices for crude oil and gold boosted the Canadian dollar and pushed the U.S. dollar
down to its lowest level since Ulysses S. Grant was president, said analysts at Scotia Capital. The dollar
reached C$0.9215 from C$0.9329 Monday.

Small stocks rose in a late burst of buying, as mining and materials issues took the leadership reins from
technology stocks.
The Russell 2000 index of small-cap shares rose 11.34 points, or 1.43%, to 801.77 -- with the bulk of the
gains coming in the last half-hour -- after falling as much as six points earlier. The Standard &Poor's
SmallCap 600 added 5.58, or 1.36%, to 415.24.
"Ever since the Fed announcement, or right prior, the market got into volatility mode and can't quit," said
James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
A number of mining companies surged again yesterday as a weaker dollar helped precious-metal prices
continue to soar. Coeur d'Alene Mines rose 52 cents, or 14%, to $4.36 on the New York Stock Exchange,
because of the higher silver and gold prices and a Wall Street analyst's comments that the Idaho miner's
stock was undervalued. U.S. Gold added 40 cents, or 9.3%, to 4.71 on the American Stock Exchange.
Shares of tire makers fell after Cooper Tire &Rubber's third-quarter results raised concerns. Cooper fell 3.06,
or 15%, to 17.94 on the NYSE. Tire-technology concern Amerityre declined eight cents, or 2.9%, to 2.71.
Airlines faced more selling as oil prices closed in on $100 a barrel. Among small carriers, AirTran Holdings
(NYSE) fell 23 cents, or 2.3%, to 9.63, and Alaska Air Group (NYSE) slipped 46 cents, or 1.9%, to 23.36.
Tech stocks saw mixed fortunes. DivX rose 3.91, or 33%, to 15.89 after the San Diego maker of
video-compression software posted third-quarter operating earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates.
Limelight Networks declined 1.29, or 10%, to 11.23 as third-quarter losses widened.
Valassis Communications jumped 2.23, or 21%, to 12.87 on the NYSE after the Livonia, Mich., producer of
newspaper inserts and other marketing materials posted a sharp increase in profit and revenue.
Novatel Wireless fell 4.70, or 18%, to 21.72 after the San Diego provider of broadband-technology products
reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, but Wall Street analysts expressed concerns over the
company's valuation and increasing competition.
Tenet Healthcare rose 72 cents, or 22%, to 3.95 on the NYSE after the Dallas hospital-chain operator said its
third-quarter loss narrowed as it admitted more insured patients.

Shrugging off fears about bad loans and turning their attention back to the robust world economy, investors
bid the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 117.54 points.
Broad market gains were led by beaten-down financial stocks, small stocks and shares of companies, such
as oil producers and materials makers, that benefit most from strong economic growth.
The Dow industrials, which have been buffeted by credit worries linked to bad mortgage securities,
rebounded 0.87% to 13660.94. The blue-chip average is ahead 9.6% in 2007, although still more than 500
points below its record 14164.53, hit Oct. 9.
Oil futures jumped 2.9%, or $2.72, to $96.70 a barrel, the highest price ever in nominal terms on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. At one point during the day, oil broke $97, closing in on the 1980 record,
measured in current, inflation-adjusted dollars, of $101.70.
Oil futures are up 58% this year, amid talk supplies are getting squeezed amid rising world demand. Heating
oil and gasoline also rose, sparking fears about the impact on consumer spending for the holiday season, but
investors looked past that concern.
Gold, whose gains have been attributed to both inflation fears and world commodity demand, surged $12.70
to $820.80 a troy ounce, a 27-year high.
The dollar hit another record low against the euro.
Worries lurked about inflation and the housing and loan-market troubles. But, at least for now, investors
hoped global growth would help companies get past those problems.
"All this concern we had about Citigroup, it affected the market a few days ago, and now it seems almost as if
it is old news," said stock trader Larry Peruzzi at Boston Company Asset Management., it affected the market
a few days ago, and now it seems almost as if it is old news," said stock trader Larry Peruzzi at
An index of bank shares rose 2%, but investors were picky about which they wanted. J.P. Morgan Chase
rose 3.1%, and Goldman Sachs Group added 2.2%, but Citigroup itself fell 2.3%, and Morgan Stanley fell
1.9%.
Exxon Mobil, which had slumped on its disappointing profit report, rebounded 3.1%.
The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index, which includes a big dose of financial stocks, rose 1.20%, or 18.10
points, to 1520.27, up 7.2% this year.
The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.07%, or 30.00 points, to finish at 2825.18, ahead 17% in 2007.
Outside the U.S., stocks advanced in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks,
rose 0.95%, or 2.69 points, to 285.65.
In major U.S. market action:
Stocks rose. Total trading volume for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.82 billion shares,
as 2,110 stocks rose and 1,188 fell.
Bond prices declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, or $3.13 for each $1,000 invested, pushing the
yield up to 4.356%. The 30-year bond was down 19/32 to yield 4.652%.

Dollar Gains on Euro As Investors Trim Risk

NEW YORK -- The dollar advanced against the euro, as investors trimmed riskier positions as worries
continued to grow over problems in the U.S. banking sector.
Financial markets were vexed by a heightened sense of risk aversion from news of more write-offs,
leadership departures and analyst downgrades for U.S. banks.
During bouts of risk aversion, lower-yielding currencies, which the dollar has become, benefit from a return of
funds that were used to purchase higher-yielding, riskier assets. The dollar doubly benefits from safe-haven
flows from assets like gold or oil that are denominated in the U.S. currency.
The euro was at $1.4471in New York late yesterday afternoon, down from from $1.4514 late Friday, while the
dollar was at 114.52 yen, compared with 114.82 yen the previous trading day. The U.K. pound was at
$2.0811, down from $2.0896.
Although the dollar firmed on the euro, it made no significant intraday movements in New York, despite
yesterday's positive U.S. economic data.
Instead, brief dollar spikes were seen as buying opportunities to go into euro positions, said Niels From,
senior foreign exchange strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt.
The market needs clear proof that the subprime-mortgage crisis is over to be convinced that going short on
the euro against the dollar could make sense, said Roberto Mialich, foreign-exchange strategist at Bayerische
Hypo- &Vereinsbank AG of UniCredit in Milan.
Looking ahead, financial markets this week will focus on rate-setting meetings at the European Central Bank
and Bank of England, as well as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony on Capitol Hill before the U.S.
Joint Economic Committee -- all set for Thursday.
Any hawkish remarks from the ECB or BOE will send the dollar down, according to analysts.

Inflation Holds Potential For Profits in Certain Sectors
Abreast of the Market
Inflation Holds Potential For Profits in Certain Sectors

Investors have lots of things to worry about these days, so it is understandable that they aren't focusing on
the prospect of higher inflation. It is one scenario that could turn out to be painful, or profitable.
Of 10 sectors in the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index, two are in the red for the year, both with lots to lose if
inflation creeps up. The so-called consumer-discretionary sector is off 7% amid fears consumers will cut
back nonessential purchases if there is a general rise in prices throughout the economy. The financial sector
has fared even worse, off 14.3% this year.
Analysts say most of the financial sector's losses are directly related to bad mortgage bets at Wall Street
firms. It doesn't help that faster inflation would likely bring higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve,
raising the cost of deal making.
On the other hand, the S&P's biggest winners, all up more than 20%, are the energy, basic-materials and
information-technology sectors. All stand to benefit from red-hot economies overseas and, if necessary,
inflation in the U.S.
A surge in inflation isn't happening now. Still, there are signs much higher consumer prices could be on their
way soon, perhaps early next year.
Oil prices have soared to records above $95 a barrel, the dollar has continued to weaken, and the Fed has
effectively increased the supply of money sloshing through the economy by cutting interest rates twice in six
weeks. Gold is trading at more than $800 a troy ounce, the highest level since January 1980.
"We don't think inflation is imminent, but there is certainly some risk in the financial system caused by the
strength of [raw] materials prices," said strategist Jack Caffrey of J.P. Morgan Chase.
Combined with concerns about the subprime lending crisis and the availability of credit, such worries are
taking a toll on the stock market. Despite government reports showing surprisingly strong economic growth in
the third quarter and strong payroll growth in October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week
down 211.60 points, or 1.5%, to 13595.10, after a 362.14-point decline Thursday. The Dow is still up 9.1%
this year, although it is more than 569 points from its record close less than a month ago, Oct. 9.
"We have a mixed economic picture right now," says economist Leo Kamp of asset-management firm
TIAA-CREF. "Things have held up pretty well, but the Fed has been clear that it's worried about inflation,
especially in light of the energy rally, which probably will filter into inflation at some point."
When it announced a quarter-point cut in its target short-term interest rate at the end of last month, the Fed
indicated that it would be watching for signs of inflation before policy makers meet again in December. It cut
rates by a half-point in September.
The consumer-price index for September showed an annual inflation rate of 2.1%, excluding volatile food
and energy prices. Known as the core inflation rate, that is just within reach of the Fed's comfort zone for the
economy of about 2%, but the so-called headline number, which includes everything, was up 2.8% annually.
Although the Fed usually tracks core inflation to set its rate policy, many experts believe the impact of food
and energy prices on other goods is so pervasive that it will eventually translate into core inflation.
The broad-based Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index has risen 10.6%, outpacing the Dow industrials and the
Standard &Poor's 500-stock index. After slipping 1.7% last week, the S&P 500 is up 6.4% this year.

The dollar has hit a series of lows against the euro and is off 9% this year. This raises the cost of imports for
U.S. consumers, although it helps earnings of big U.S. companies whose overseas profits are translated into
dollars. Friday, the euro fetched $1.4514.
Most Wall Street pros believe economic growth has slowed in the fourth quarter and are pinning their hopes
on fast-growing overseas economies, like China's, to bolster the profits of large U.S. companies with
significant foreign operations. That has helped sectors such as technology and energy, which get more than
half their sales from outside the U.S., says Mr. Caffrey of J.P. Morgan. "You have this weird combination of
gunk and junk leading the way right now," he said, referring to oil and tech.
Tech stocks continued to be a bright spot last week, as the Nasdaq Composite Index finished with a slight
gain, up 0.2% for the week and 16.4% on the year.
Financial stocks took a big hit, as more banks reported big losses on assets linked to risky subprime
mortgages and Merrill Lynch &Co. Chief Executive Stan O'Neal was forced out. The financial sector of the
S&P 500 slid 6% for the week.
Energy stocks also were lower, hurt by disappointing earnings from Exxon Mobil, which had a difficult time
matching its heady year-ago results amid the long-running oil boom. The S&P 500's energy components were
off 2.2% for the week, but they have posted a solid 26.4% gain on the year.
If inflation does return in full force in the months ahead, Mr. Caffrey says, basic-materials stocks and energy
companies could continue to do well. The tech rally could come to an end, though, because many investors
buy such stocks looking for big profits far into the future.
Because inflation effectively eats into the value of dollars that an investor expects to receive in the future, it
would be bad for speculative investments like tech stocks. If the Fed and other central banks raise interest
rates to fight inflation, it would hurt the ability of fledgling tech companies to raise financing for new projects.
Don Rissmiller, chief economist at Strategas Research Partners, says inflation is a risk to the market, but he
noted that the Fed has a while to consider its next rate move; policy makers don't meet again until
mid-December.
If more data surface like Friday's strong jobs report, many Wall Street pros believe the Fed could hold its rate
target steady, to avoid adding too much cheap money to fuel the economy on the heels of the latest two rate
cuts. "The Fed gives money to the private sector," with rate cuts, Mr. Rissmiller said. "If we're productive with
it, we'll get goods. If we're unproductive, we'll get inflation."

Strong October Jobs Growth Sends Another Mixed Signal on Economy
Strong October Jobs Growth Sends Another Mixed Signal on Economy

A surprising surge in October payrolls suggested a U.S. economy running at two speeds -- with strength in
the service sector offsetting weakness from a plummeting housing sector and gyrating credit markets.
Employers added 166,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said, the most in five months. The
unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.7% despite widespread worries that the odds of a recession
are rising.
"Parts of the economy are fraying, but the labor market hasn't broken," said J.P. Morgan economist Haseeb
Ahmed.
Friday's report capped a week of conflicting signals. Earlier in the week, the government said the economy
grew at a robust 3.9% pace in the third quarter, helped by surging exports. Yet consumer confidence fell, and
a survey of purchasing managers suggested a loss of momentum for manufacturers.
Credit-market worries, meanwhile, reemerged due to troubles at major banks, leading to a sharp sell-off in
stocks; the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27.23 to close at 13595.10 on Friday, but for the week was off
1.5%, or 211.60. Crude oil continued its steady rise, with the benchmark crude-oil futures price up $2.49 to
$95.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, another new nominal high. Gold futures smashed
$800 an ounce, hitting $810.70 an ounce, and recently traded at $807.90.
The Federal Reserve cut its key interest rate by one-quarter percentage point this past week, citing its
expectation that the economy "will likely slow in the near term," and signaled its reluctance to cut rates again.
But even after the upbeat employment report, financial markets continue to anticipate another quarter-point
rate cut in December. "One day you see financial turmoil and financial markets going crazy, and the next day
you see a number of good jobs being created. It makes you much less certain about what [the Fed] needs to
do," said Brian Fabbri, BNP Paribas's chief economist for North America.
Friday's cheery employment headlines didn't dispel many economists' diagnosis that that the U.S. economy is
slowing significantly, pulled down by a persistent decline in housing construction and housing prices. The
volatility in financial markets continues to create unease. "It's those abysmal sectors that are going to create
more financial problems, and those financial problems are going to feed back into the economy and create
more weakness ahead," said Mr. Fabbri, who, like many other forecasters, expects fourth-quarter growth of
between 1% and 1.5%.
Many forecasters expect weaker consumer spending to push growth lower. Paul Ashworth, an economist at
Capital Economics Ltd., a London-based research firm, said the economy faces the risk of contracting due to
plummeting consumer confidence, higher oil prices and the effects of the housing downturn. "I'd probably
characterize the October payroll figures as the last hurrah," he said.
The International Monetary Fund's new chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn called the jobs numbers "much more
than expected," but said no recent developments in the global had changed the IMF's view that the U.S.
economy would slow in 2008, but avoid recession. "There is no evident signal that it [U.S. economy] will go
further than a slowdown," he told reporters.
Much of October's payroll increase came in restaurants, leisure and hospitality, education, health and
professional business services. Payrolls fell in manufacturing and construction and in housing-related finance,
though finance as a whole added jobs.
Temporary employment, sometimes seen as a leading indicator of overall job trends, rose as well after
declining since February. Temp agencies had been struggling all year, depending on growth abroad to offset
weak U.S. results.

Adecco SA, the world's largest temp-employment firm, said Friday that third-quarter world-wide revenues
rose 2% while revenue in the U.S. and Canada dropped 8%. "We don't see a recession in the U.S.," Chief
Executive Dieter Scheiff told investors. "And we continue to see solid growth rates in Europe and Asia."
A seasonally adjusted drop in payrolls among retailers could portend caution heading into the holiday
shopping season. OfficeMax, for instance, reported disappointing earnings growth this past week, and CEO
Sam Duncan said the firm would slash costs and adjust its promotional plans "in light of more cautious
shopping trends by retail consumers and small businesses."
"This is supposed to be, like, the worst holiday season in four or five years, and that concerns us," he said on
a conference call.
Average hourly earnings of production and non-supervisory rose just 0.2% in October, the smallest increase
since March, a sign that households may not have as much to spend in coming months, but economists said
that reading may have been distorted because a large number of jobs added in October were lower-wage
jobs. Hourly earnings are up 3.8% from a year ago. The Labor Department's measure of the total number of
hours worked in the economy is running 1.5% ahead of last October, an increase but significantly slower than
the 2.6% increase in the previous 12 months.
The jobs report is subject to substantial revisions; the report on August employment initially showed a drop of
4,000 jobs, which is now estimated to be a gain of about 93,000. The government now says employers added
96,000 jobs in September, down 14,000 from its initial estimate. Job gains of about 100,000 a month, given
current demographics, are generally considered enough to keep the unemployment rate steady.
But Dean Baker. co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington think
tank, noted that October marked another month in the ongoing decline in the fraction of the population
working, now at 62.7%. "This drop is being driven by younger workers, as people over age 55 continue to
work in growing numbers," he said.
