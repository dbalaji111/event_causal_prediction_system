World Is Bitten By the Gold Bug
World Is Bitten By the Gold Bug

Gold continued its upward march in a time of global financial tumult, closing above $1,500 an ounce
Thursday for the first time as investors seek safe haven in the metal.
In a remarkable performance for any sort of asset, gold has notched a record high every day this week -- on
days when investors were alternately gloomy and optimistic.
On Monday, as stocks swooned after Standard & Poor's warned about the credit rating of the U.S., gold
reached a new high. It kept rising on Tuesday and again on Wednesday, as stocks soared on impressive
corporate earnings.
On Thursday, gold rose $4.90 an ounce to $1,503.20, another nominal record high and its first settlement
above $1,500. Gold is up for five straight weeks, and has gained 5.8% so far this year. Gold will not trade in
the U.S. today, Good Friday.
The reason for gold's ability to do well in any market lies in its recent role as a haven from concerns about
the dollar, inflation and shocks in Europe, the Middle East and Japan.
"Gold has more than one hat right now," said Adam Klopfenstein, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
division of MF Global. "What people are seeing around the globe is that there's really nowhere to hide right
now. When one camp cools down on buying gold, you are seeing another camp come in."
Gold's rise is a broader reflection of a lack of confidence in governments' abilities to sort out fiscal problems.
Investors are concerned not only about the value of the U.S. dollar, a worry accentuated by S&P's decision to
downgrade the U.S. debt outlook. They also are concerned about the outlook for the euro, as the sovereign
debt crisis in Europe worsens, and the yen, which faces hurdles as the Japanese economy recovers from its
recent earthquake and tsunami. Gold is seen as a lasting store of value, which doesn't erode like that of
currencies.
"If you have two major currencies looking a little bit wobbly, some investors and speculators put their money
into gold," said Barry M. Wainstein, Global Head of Foreign Exchange & Precious Metals at Scotia Capital, a
subsidiary of Bank of Nova Scotia.
Some currency traders have sold their positions and bought physical gold recently, he said. As the metal
barrels higher, investors of all stripes are jumping in. And buyers are increasingly taking possession of gold,
instead of trading futures contracts.
Everyone from university endowments to small individual investors has been buying bars and coins.
Operators of storage vaults are scrambling to find more space to shelter the bullion, and are stepping up
hiring to deal with the extra work load.
The metal has rallied despite the interest-rate hikes by the European Central Bank and the People's Bank of
China in early April. A higher interest rate means a higher return on cash, and typically is negative for gold,
which yields nothing. However, gold investors took the rate increases in stride.
Gold has scaled new heights in all currencies. In dollars, gold rose 1.2% this week, in euro terms it rose
0.9%, and in pounds it is up 0.5%.
John Hummel, chief investment officer with AIS Futures Management LLC, which oversees $500 million in
assets, said he is "extremely bullish on gold." About 80% of AIS's $125 million Tactical Asset Allocation
Portfolio is in gold.

--- Page 6 ---

His primary argument: Central banks and private investors are increasingly turning to gold as an alternative
store of value as paper currencies continue to fall. As of the end of March, central banks around the world
held 27,219.8 metric tons of gold, or 11.3% of their total reserve holdings, according to the World Gold
Council. The rest is held in the form of reserve currencies such as the U.S. dollar.
"At some point, foreign holders will refuse to accept greater amounts of U.S. debt or the dollar as reserve
currency," Mr. Hummel said in a note to investors.
Some people are concerned by the fact that gold is on everyone's buy list.
The greater risk for gold at this stage is not higher interest rates, but growth and stability, said Daniel
Brebner, head of metals research for Deutsche Bank in London.
Gold could lose allure if investors conclude that the world has returned to a benign investment environment,
where growth is sustainable without extraordinary government support. If that happens, he said, "the reasons
for investors moving into gold start to reverse."
Because so many have piled into the market so quickly, the risk of a swift reversal becomes ever greater. The
gold market, while popular, is relatively small compared to stocks and bonds, making it more sensitive to
sentiment swings.
Demand in India, the largest consumer of gold, is likely to fade once its festival season ends with the arrival
of the monsoons in June, said Jeffrey Rhodes, global head of precious metals at INTL Commodities, a
commodities broker.
Mr. Rhodes still thinks gold will move higher later this year. And some say gold has much further to rise.
GFMS Ltd., a London-based metals consultancy, predicts gold will reach $1,600 an ounce before the end of
this year.
The University of Texas Investment Management Co. recently converted all its gold futures holdings into
physical bullion, worth about $1 billion.
"It's a very conservative hedge" against some low-probability scenarios, such as the debasement of a major
currency, said Bruce Zimmerman, chief executive officer of the $26.6-billion fund. The Texas fund has 20.7
tons of gold stored in a New York vault.
In 2010, total physical bullion investment soared 66% to 880 metric tons, says GFMS, and the trend looks set
to be repeated this year.
"These are long-term holdings," said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, an online service for
private investors to trade precious metals. Physical holdings are farther from the financial markets and less
prone to short-term sell-offs.
In Oklahoma City, bullion dealer American Precious Metals Exchange has seen a surge of orders for gold
bars and coins. In the past year, the company has doubled its work force and tripled its phone connections,
said Michael Haynes, chief executive officer. To warehouse more gold, it had to double its vaulting space
located underground in a former Federal Reserve building in downtown Oklahoma City in November.
"All of those people that missed out buying gold . . . are kind of re-energized and jumping in," said Robert
Higgins, chief executive of First State Depository LLC, a Wilmington, Del.-based storage operator. He has
hired three people in the past six weeks and is considering starting a night shift to handle all the inquiries.

Debt Takes a Holiday --- Light Trade, Little Direction in Market

Debt Takes a Holiday --- Light Trade, Little Direction in Market

NEW YORK -- Benchmark Treasurys were flat Thursday as a stocks rally offset disappointing U.S. economic
data and worries about sovereign-debt problems in the euro zone.
Trading was light ahead of the Good Friday holiday. The bond market closed at 2 p.m. EDT Thursday and will
remain so on Friday.
U.S. stocks rose on the back of strong corporate earnings reports, diluting the strength in bonds.
"Treasurys got a bid because data continues to disappoint" which adds to concern about the strength of the
economic recovery, said James Golden, head of Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co. in New York. "Light
trading is exaggerating moves in bond prices."
Late afternoon, the benchmark 10-year note was unchanged to yield 3.398%. The two-year note was
unchanged to yield 0.669%. The 30-year bond fell 13/32 to yield 4.475%. Bond prices and yields move in
opposite directions.
Two reports Thursday raised some anxiety about the strength of the economic recovery. The business index
released by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia fell to 18.5 in April from 43.4 in March. Economists had
expected a drop to 35. Readings above zero denote expansion.
Meanwhile, initial jobless claims decreased by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 403,000 in the week ended
April 16. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast claims would fall by 17,000.
Many economists have lowered their U.S. economic growth forecasts for the first quarter. Questions have
emerged on whether the economy could expand at a robust pace in the second half of the year when
monetary and fiscal stimulus wane.
The Federal Reserve is set to complete its $600 billion Treasury bond-buying program by the end of June
while U.S. lawmakers are pushing for spending cuts to shrink the bloated fiscal deficit. Standard & Poor's
warned Monday that it could cut the U.S.'s triple-A credit ratings by 2013 without a credible plan to reduce the
budget shortfall.
While some investors said deficit reduction would shore up foreign investors' confidence to buy Treasurys
and other dollar assets longer term, fiscal austerity is likely to be a drag on short-term economic growth.
The Fed's monetary policy meeting next week will be a key focus. The central bank is widely expected to
hold the key policy rates near zero while stating again that it will complete the full size of the Treasury buying
program in June.
The highlight will be Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's first news briefing, due at about 2:15 p.m. EDT on April
27, after conclusion of the policy meeting. Investors will zero in on the Fed chief's assessment of the growth
and inflation outlook which would determine when the central bank will shift to tightening monetary policy.
"This is the first time the Fed has taken such a step to improve transparency and clarity," said Adrian K.
Miller, senior fixed-income strategist at Miller Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York. "However,
Bernanke is a very skilled communicator and I would expect his prepared comments or those from the
question-and-answer session to not reveal anything different that what the Fed policy statement will deliver."
New debt supply is another focus. The Treasury Department announced Thursday that it will sell $99 billion
new notes next week, matching forecasts by many market participants. The supply will include $35 billion in
two-year notes, $35 billion in five-year notes and $29 billion in seven-year notes.

The Treasury Department on Thursday sold $14 billion in five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities at
a yield of negative 0.18%. The negative yield means investors paid a premium to buy the securities, reflecting
some anxiety about the longer-term inflation risks in the U.S. The value of TIPS is adjusted on the changes
in consumer prices, making it a popular hedge against inflation. Gold, another popular hedge, hit a new high
at $1,503.20 an ounce.

Fleeing the Dollar Flood
REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Fleeing the Dollar Flood
756 words
21 April 2011
The Wall Street Journal

Members of the International Monetary Fund emerged from their huddle in Washington last weekend
resolved to keep every option open to slow the flood of dollars pouring into their countries, including capital
controls. That's a dangerous game, given the need for investment to drive economic development. But it's
also increasingly typical of the world's reaction to America's mismanagement of the dollar and its eroding
financial leadership.
The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and as such the Federal Reserve is the closest thing we have to a
global central bank. Yet for at least a decade, and especially since late 2008, the Fed has operated as if its
only concern is the U.S. domestic economy.
The Fed's relentlessly easy monetary policy combined with Congress's reckless spending have driven
investors out of the United States and into Asia, South America and elsewhere in search of higher returns
and more sustainable growth. The IMF estimates that between the third quarter of 2009 and second quarter
of 2010, Turkey saw a 6.9% inflow in capital as a percentage of GDP, South Africa 6.6%, Thailand 5%, and
so on.
This incoming wall of money puts the central bankers in these countries in a bind. If they do nothing, the
result can be asset bubbles and inflation. Brazil (6.3%) and China (5.4% officially but no doubt higher in fact)
are both enduring bursts of inflation, as are many other countries. These nations can raise interest rates or
let their own currencies appreciate, at the risk of slower economic growth. Rather than endure that
adjustment, many countries are resorting to capital controls and other administrative measures to try to stop
the inflow.
Over the past year, Brazil has introduced taxes on stock and bond investment and raised bank reserve
requirements; Indonesia has introduced holding periods for government bonds; South Korea has limited
banks' ability to engage in foreign-currency financing, among other things; Peru and Turkey have taken
action, too. Yet their currencies have in many cases continued to rise and the money keeps coming in.
So it was little surprise earlier this month when IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn joined the parade and
endorsed capital controls as a necessary "tool" to be used on a "temporary basis," ending the fund's
long-time commitment to free flows of capital. The last time the fund did this was amid the Mexico monetary
crisis of the mid-1990s.
The IMF wanted its members last weekend to endorse guidelines on when they would use such measures.
Brazil's finance minister spoke for many when he refused, calling capital controls necessary "self defense"
measures against "spillover effects" from other countries' policies. He meant the U.S.
As if to underscore the point, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner responded by pointing the finger right
back at developing countries, essentially updating Treasury Secretary John Connally's famous line to a
delegation of Europeans in the 1970s that the dollar is "our currency but your problem."
The larger story is that the world is starting to protect, and perhaps ultimately free, itself from America's weak
dollar standard. The European Central Bank recently raised interest rates and may do so again to prevent
an inflation breakout. China is allowing more trade to be conducted in yuan, a first step toward making it a
global currency. At a meeting of developing countries -- the so-called BRICs -- in China recently, leaders
called for "a broad-based international reserve currency system providing stability and certainty." They
weren't referring to the dollar.
Even in the U.S., Americans are buying commodities (oil per barrel: $111) and gold ($1,500 an ounce) as a
dollar hedge, and the state of Utah recently took steps to make it easier for citizens to buy and sell gold as a
de facto alternative currency. Whether or not these prove to be wise investments, they are certainly signals of
mistrust in Washington's economic stewardship.

At an economic town hall this week, President Obama blamed "speculators" for rising oil prices. He should
have mentioned the Fed and his own Treasury, which have encouraged the world to invest in hedges against
the falling dollar. Chairman Ben Bernanke and Mr. Geithner have deliberately pursued a policy of
unprecedented monetary and spending stimulus to reflate the economy and boost asset prices. The bill is
coming due in a weak dollar, food and energy inflation, and the decline of U.S. economic credibility.

Dow Rises 187 Points As Profits Look Rosy

Investors again demonstrated the power of positive thinking on Wednesday, driving U.S. stocks near
three-year highs and snapping up growth-sensitive assets like copper and the Australian dollar.
After a shaky start to the week, when Standard & Poor's issued a warning on the U.S. credit rating, stocks
have rebounded. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 186.79 points, or 1.52%, to finish at 12453.54, its
highest close in nearly three years. The blue-chip index is now 12% from its all-time high.
Stocks also were up in Europe and Asia. Much of the optimism on Wednesday was driven by strong earnings
from U.S. companies including Intel and Yahoo. That helped refocus investors away from worries about the
U.S. debt burden. As well, gold again rose above $1,500 an ounce before drifting back to close at a record
$1,498.30. Oil rose 2.9% and the Australian dollar reached a fresh high, trading at $1.0646 late Wednesday.
Investors have grown increasingly confident in the global economic recovery, despite a series of
market-rattling events that has tested investors' nerves. The gains have defied skeptics, who have for months
been declaring a correction is nigh.
"In the background, there's a strong tide at work," said David Kelly, chief market strategist for J.P. Morgan
Funds. "Two years ago, there was an overreaction to the crisis -- companies were laying off too many
workers, investors were moving too much into cash and bonds. Now, there's a growing belief the U.S.
economy is on the mend, and a lot of people need to reposition back to normal."
On Wednesday, investors sold safe-haven assets including Treasury bonds and the dollar, which sank to
new multiyear lows against its rivals. The euro posted its biggest one-day gain in three months, rising to
$1.4511, a 15-month high. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six
other currencies, is now at its lowest point since November 2009.
First-quarter corporate earnings on average are on track to beat analysts' estimates, following a pattern of the
past several quarters.
Intel, the largest maker of computer chips, late on Tuesday issued a strong forecast, pushing its stock up
7.8%. The earnings helped lift technology stocks globally.
The Nasdaq Composite posted its biggest one-day point gain since September, rising 57.54 points, or 2.1%,
to 2802.51.
Many multinationals, including Johnson & Johnson and Citigroup, reported robust gains in their international
markets.
"There's been an enormous increase in global consumer spending" said Burt White, chief investment officer
at LPL Financial in Boston. It's been off-the-chart good."
The specter of rising commodity prices hasn't factored prominently in corporate outlooks, providing solace to
investors concerned about input-price pressures and profit margins.
Global giants in manufacturing and heavy industry fared particularly well on Wednesday. Caterpillar surged
2.5%, Boeing added 2.6%, 3M gained 2.1% and United Technologies rose 4.3%.
Major U.S. stock indexes are now in positive territory for the week and the month. On Monday, the Dow fell
nearly 250 points in intraday trading after S&P lowered its outlook on U.S. government debt, underscoring
Washington's fiscal bind.

"So far this week, the best investment has been a neck brace," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist
with RidgeWorth Investments.
Both Tuesday and Wednesday, however, saw strong data points from the U.S. housing sector, a moribund
corner of the economy that many investors had already written off.
"When I think about what's really holding the U.S. economy back, it's confidence -- and housing is absolutely
the center of that," said Mr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan. "In the past two days, we've had better-than-expected
numbers on housing starts and existing-home sales, and that's why people are feeling better about growth in
the U.S."
Mr. Gayle of RidgeWorth said the S&P debt warning is hurting the dollar, which has boosted prices for
commodities like copper, silver, gold and oil -- all of which are priced in dollars.
Amid optimism about global growth, crude oil mounted its biggest one-day advance since the escalation of
Libyan hostilities last month, finishing 2.9% higher at $111.45 a barrel. The surge lifted oil producers, which
saw their stocks soar.
Copper jumped 2.6% and silver reached a new 31-year high.

U.S. Warned on Debt Load --- S&P Signals Top Credit Rating Is in Danger, Stoking Political Battle on Deficit
U.S. Warned on Debt Load --- S&P Signals Top Credit Rating Is in Danger, Stoking Political Battle on
Deficit

A blunt warning Monday from a credit-rating firm about the U.S. government's mounting debt pushed stock
markets lower and intensified political divisions in Washington about how best to tackle growing deficits.
Both the Obama administration and House Republicans scrambled to gain leverage from Standard & Poor's
changing its outlook on U.S. Treasury securities to "negative" from "stable."
S&P didn't lower its top-notch AAA-bond rating for U.S. government Treasury securities, and their prices
initially fell but later rebounded amid optimism that the report could serve as a catalyst to force both sides in
Washington to compromise.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 140.24 points, or 1.14%, to 12201.59, its biggest decline in a month,
after earlier tumbling almost 250 points. Stocks in Britain, Germany and France fell more than 2%, with most
of the declines coming after the S&P news, and in early trading Tuesday, Japan shares fell 1%. Gold surged
to just below $1,500 an ounce.
But hopes that the report might spur a deficit deal actually helped U.S. borrowing costs and the dollar. The
10-year Treasury note rose 9/32 in price, pushing its yield down to 3.373%, its lowest 3:00 p.m. level since
March 23. The dollar rose against the euro.
A downgrade would push up interest rates on Treasurys, which are a benchmark for other consumer and
business borrowing rates, raising the cost of credit throughout the economy.
S&P also revised its outlook on five big U.S. insurance groups that currently are rated AAA, to negative from
stable. S&P said the five U.S.-focused insurers "are constrained by the sovereign rating on the U.S."
The insurers are Knights of Columbus, New York Life Insurance Co., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Co., Teachers Insurance & Annuity Assoc. of America and United Services Automobile Association.
New York Life said its financial and business strength justified continued triple-A ratings. USAA noted that
S&P maintained the insurer's AAA credit and financial strength ratings. And Northwestern Mutual said it
remains "confident in the strength of our business model." The others couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
Japan, meanwhile, expressed confidence in U.S. government debt. "We continue to believe that U.S.
Treasurys are an attractive product for us," said Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda.
The S&P report questioned whether the White House and Republicans would be able to reach an agreement
before the 2012 presidential elections on a plan to rein in deficits. "The sign of political gridlock was a key
determinant in our outlook change," said John Chambers, chairman of the sovereign ratings committee at
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
This year's budget deficit is projected to rise to between $1.5 trillion and $1.65 trillion, equal to roughly 10% of
America's gross domestic product, or total economic output. The White House is hoping to form a group of
Democratic and Republican lawmakers to craft a framework for reducing the deficit, but has made little
progress. Vice President Joe Biden plans to host the group's first meeting May 5.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has warned lawmakers that their reluctance to raise the federal
borrowing limit could cripple the recovery, and the jittery reaction to the S&P report could underscore his
arguments about how badly markets would react to any failure to raise the debt ceiling.

The U.S. debt now stands at $14.219 trillion -- just shy of the $14.294 trillion cap -- and is expected to balloon
in part because of rising costs for health care, retirement and other so-called entitlement programs, and the
interest on existing debt.
If no action is taken, the government could default on its debt by July 8. Wall Street executives have called
Capitol Hill with increasing frequency in recent weeks, urging it to raise the debt ceiling immediately.
Although S&P said it changed its outlook even while assuming the debt ceiling will be increased, many
Republicans cited the report in affirming their position that they would raise it only in exchange for a
commitment to address the deficit.
"As S&P made clear, getting spending and our deficit under control can no longer be put off for another day,
which is why House Republicans will only move forward on the President's request to increase the debt limit if
it is accompanied by serious reforms that immediately reduce federal spending and end the culture of debt in
Washington," said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.).
White House and Treasury Department officials, who were alerted to the report on Friday, questioned its
conclusions but said it validated their efforts to broker a bipartisan deal to address the debt.
"Any call for a bipartisan agreement on deficit reduction, on fiscal reform, is a welcome one, and in that
context, I think that it adds to what we believe is some momentum towards that end," said White House
spokesman Jay Carney.
The move to a negative outlook means S&P believes there is a one-in-three chance that Treasury bonds
could be downgraded from their AAA rating, the ratings agency said.
Moody's, another U.S. ratings firm, came to a different conclusion in its Weekly Credit Outlook. It called the
changed parameters of the debate a turning point.
Since S&P began assigning outlooks to government debt in 1989, five AAA-rated countries have been
assigned negative outlooks, including Britain in 2009. Three were subsequently downgraded, and Britain and
one other were returned to a stable outlook. S&P acted after it determined that new British austerity
measures to cut spending and raise revenue would reduce the government deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014
from 11.2% in 2009.
If the U.S. reaches a British-style resolution, S&P will restore the U.S. outlook to stable, Mr. Chambers said.
The White House last week proposed reducing the deficit at a moderate pace through a combination of tax
increases, changes to Medicare and cuts in military and other spending. Republicans have called for quicker
action, with bigger cuts in spending and overhauls of Medicare and Medicaid.
S&P said the difference was stark. "We see the path to agreement as challenging because the gap between
the parties remains wide," the report said.
Bill Gross, a founder of Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of the world's biggest bond fund,
dumped government-related holdings in February. He said the S&P action "is one warning shot at least to
investors that should be loud and clear in Washington."

Inflation Fears Drive Gold --- Settles at $1,485.30 an Ounce; 'the Heck With the Dollar'

NEW YORK -- Gold pushed further into record territory as renewed fears about inflation and sovereign-debt
default spurred investment demand for safe-harbor assets.
The price of the thinly traded gold futures contract for April delivery rose 0.9%, or $13.60, to $1,485.30 a troy
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the front-month contract's highest
settlement ever.
The most actively traded contract, for June delivery, also rose 0.9%, or $13.60, to settle at $1,486.00 a troy
ounce.
This past week, metals consultancy GFMS Ltd. said it expects gold to break through $1,600 before the end
of 2011.
"Assuming investment demand will at some point take off again this year, there remains good scope for new
highs in the price to be recorded," the London company said in its annual gold market survey.
On Friday, investors flocked to the safety of precious metals after monthly data showed China's
consumer-price index climbed 5.4% in March from a year earlier, outpacing forecasts of a 5.3% rise.
"You're not in a late phase of inflation, you're in an early phase," with rates likely to pick up in the future, said
Ira Epstein, director of the Ira Epstein division of the Linn Group.
U.S. consumer prices also rose in March, with the seasonally adjusted consumer-price index up 0.5% from
February and up 2.7% from the year-earlier month, the highest level since December 2009.
The increase highlights the influence of higher commodity prices on headline inflation, as crude oil, grains
and metal prices have swelled to records in recent months.
However, underlying inflation, which excludes energy and food prices that can be volatile, rose by 0.1% in
March from February.
The tame core inflation gives the Federal Reserve latitude to keep its low interest-rate policies in place,
though many market participants worry this approach will raise long-term inflation and devalue the dollar.
"Investors are frustrated with U.S. monetary policy. They're saying the heck with the dollar, the heck with
currencies and they're buying metals," Mr. Epstein said.
Silver prices remained at 31-year highs on Friday as investors continue to buy the metal as a cheaper
alternative to gold. The price of silver has increased almost 38% this year.
On Friday, silver for April delivery rose 2.1%, or 90.5 cents, to $42.566 a troy ounce, the highest settlement
price since Jan. 17, 1980.
Gold and silver traders also kept a wary eye on Europe, where Moody's Investor Services downgraded Irish
debt by two notches to Baa-3, one level before "junk" status.

ANYONE WHO HAS INVESTED in commodities is watching the markets warily these days. After soaring for
the past few months, oil and other basic materials have tanked in the past week.
But that doesn't mean it is time to bail. Volatility is a given in the commodities markets. Investment strategists
and money managers increasingly are suggesting that investors devote a bigger chunk of their portfolios to
commodities that pass one crucial test: scarcity.
With the world's population expected to hit 9.1 billion by 2050, up from 6.7 billion today, according to the
World Bank, demand for many commodities is only expected to rise. That is especially true as
emerging-market populations get richer. In countries with per-capita gross national incomes below $1,000,
each 10% increase in income will result in a 10% increase in the use of metals, a 6% increase in the use of
grains and a 4.25% increase in the use of energy, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. research.
Yet while demand for raw materials is growing steadily, supplies of crops, water, energy and industrial metals
aren't keeping up. The world now has enough corn to last only 54 days, the lowest since 1973 and well below
the average of 120 days, according to Michael Lewis, head of commodity strategy at Deutsche Bank AG.
Copper stores are about 10% lower than they were a year ago. While water supplies are sufficient for now, by
2030 they are expected to be 40% below demand, according to the 2030 Water Resources Group, an
industry research group.
Another benefit to the scarcity trade: Investment strategists say commodities can reduce volatility in a
portfolio. Adding a 5% position in a basket of commodities to a portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds can
reduce price swings by 0.1 percentage point while adding 0.1 point of return, according to J.P. Morgan Asset
Management.
The trick for investors is to play these markets smartly. Profiting from scarcity isn't as simple as buying barrel
of oil or a bushel of cotton; investors need to consider multiple financial instruments, from exchange-traded
commodity funds and individual stocks to private-equity plays and currencies. They also should have
exposure to a broad swath of commodities, says Robert Weissenstein, a managing director at Credit Suisse
Wealth Management.
"You don't just want to diversify your commodities," he says. "You want to diversify your investments as well."
Here's what you need to know.
Agriculture and Farmland
Some crops, such as soybeans and cotton, are fundamentally in short supply, because they can be produced
only in certain soils and regions of the world. For instance, 95% of all soybean production comes from just
four countries: the U.S., China, Brazil and Argentina. Last month, Chinese officials expressed concern that
growing appetites for soybeans are outstripping supply. In 2010, China imported a record 54.8 million tons.
Other crops may not be in short supply now, but new pressures, such as a push toward ethanol production or
shifts in diet, threaten to deplete supplies. As more people eschew chicken in favor of beef, for example,
supplies of corn and wheat likely will dwindle. It takes four kilograms of feed to produce one kilogram of beef,
versus just one kilogram of feed for poultry.
That doesn't mean it is easy for investors to capitalize on rising prices. Crops are among the riskiest and most
volatile of commodities. Rather than play the futures markets, investors should look for companies that focus
on producing more food for every acre of land, such as makers of fertilizer, seed and machinery, says Dylan
Grice, a research analyst at Societe Generale SA. Market Vectors Agribusiness, an ETF, includes some of

--- Page 22 ---
Page 22 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
the largest players in agribusiness, with fertilizer company Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and seed
maker Monsanto Co. among its largest holdings. The fund is up 23% over the past 12 months.
Earlier this month, ETF firm IndexIQ launched its Global Agribusiness Small Cap ETF. The portfolio holds
companies involved in livestock operations, agricultural logistics and farm machinery.
"Emerging markets are experiencing huge bursts in their populations, and that creates a fundamental,
long-term demand for food that will outstrip supply," says Roger Nusbaum, a portfolio manager at
wealth-management firm Your Source LLC in Phoenix, which owns shares of the Market Vectors
Agribusiness ETF. "We want to be part of that story."
Another way to invest in crops is via farmland. Across the U.S., prices have surged 58% over the past
decade, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some farming hotbeds have seen big gains of late:
In 2010 alone, prices in Iowa jumped 18%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Since farmland is difficult to buy and sell quickly, diversification is crucial. There are no publicly traded
real-estate investment trusts dedicated to farmland, but strategists say some private-equity portfolios are
worth considering -- particularly those focusing on Africa, Eastern Europe, South America, Australia and
Canada, where prices haven't run up as much as they have in the U.S.
For example, Canadian private-equity firm AgCapita Partners, with $150 million under management, focuses
on Saskatchewan farmland, which for regulatory reasons is less than half the price of farmland in nearby
Alberta. The fund saw an estimated 10% appreciation in portfolio land values in 2010.
Water
Water supply is essentially finite. Yet global demand is expected to increase 53.3% by 2030, estimates the
2030 Water Resources Group.
"We think water might be the most important commodity story of the 21st century," says Charles Reinhard,
deputy chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. "Scarcity of water in Africa and Western
Asia, combined with other factors including increased urbanization globally, will likely cause demand to
exceed supply." The firm is overweight in its commodity positions.
The problem for investors is that there is no pure-play in water: Futures don't exist, and many of the
companies involved in water production are giant conglomerates, including Siemens AG and General Electric
Co., of which water is only a small part.
Barnaby Levin, a financial adviser at the HighTower Advisors in Menlo Park, Calif., says he is looking to put
clients into ETFs and funds that can deliver exposure to water through publicly traded companies.
There are four ETFs to choose from: PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio, First Trust ISE Water Index
Fund, Guggenheim S&P Global Water Index and PowerShares Global Water. Water Resources Portfolio is
the biggest, with assets of $1.2 billion. It holds stocks of smaller companies that focus on treating water for
consumption and delivery. Since its 2005 debut, the fund is up 27%, compared with a 4% increase in the S&P
500. Abraham Bailin, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., likes the fund because it has the lowest fees.
There also are four small water-focused mutual funds: Calvert Global Water, Allianz RCM Global Water, PFW
Water and Kinetics Water Infrastructure Advantaged. With just $71 million in assets, Allianz is the largest.
The fund, which focuses on water utilities, has returned 15.4% over the past year, compared with 9.8% for
the S&P 500.
Energy
Prices for energy, like food and water, are being driven largely by emerging markets. Demand there is
expected to increase 27% by the end of the decade, versus 8% for developed nations, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.
At the same time, supply remains tight. Political turmoil in OPEN nations in North Africa and the Middle East
has fueled an 18% rise in oil prices this year -- so sharp a spike that some strategists are predicting a
pullback.
Yet despite the short-term worries, some analysts say prices will move higher over the next several years as
companies struggle to extract more oil from the earth. "Investors are buying the dips because the
fundamentals are strong," says Michael Marino, an analyst at investment bank Stephens Inc.
Much of the world's oil is deep under the ocean, trapped in Canadian sand or in politically unstable countries.
Risky deep-water drilling, for instance, now accounts for about 9% of world oil production, up from 2.5% in
2000.

--- Page 23 ---
Page 23 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"BP isn't drilling in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico for the intellectual challenge," says Gary Flam, a
portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors LLC in Los Angeles, which oversees $5 billion. "It's because
that's where the oil is." He is overweight energy in his portfolio.
Many advisers recommend against oil ETFs, which suffer from a market malady known as "contango."
Commodity ETFs typically buy futures contracts rather than the underlying physical substance. Contango
kicks in when funds must replace expiring futures with longer-term contracts at higher prices, eating into
returns. The U.S. Oil Fund, for example, has gained just 5.8% over the past 12 months, even as oil has
jumped 29%.
A better bet, say strategists, is oil-sector stocks. Mr. Flam prefers oil-service and exploration companies,
because their expertise will be needed to access hard-to-reach oil.
Buying opportunities could present themselves soon. Houston-based drilling company Baker Hughes Inc.
warned in a March 3 filing that it would take a profit hit because of unseasonably cold weather and the turmoil
in the Middle East and North Africa, which hampered its ability to deliver equipment to oil fields. Other service
providers are expected to announce similar problems when they report earnings in the next several weeks,
which could shave a few dollars from their stock prices.
Investors can also purchase ETFs or mutual funds holding shares of oil companies. The SPDR S&P Oil &
Gas Equipment and Services ETF, for example, has returned 35% in the past year. PowerShares Dynamic
Energy Exploration & Production Portfolio, which holds shares of Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., is up
42% over that span. iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index, with holdings like Halliburton Co., is up
39%.
Strategists caution against natural-gas and alternative-energy plays, however. The development of
hydraulic-fracturing techniques in recent years has allowed access to previously unreachable supplies of
natural gas, causing prices to plunge. That, in turn, has removed power producers' incentives to develop
alternative energy such as wind and solar. The Guggenheim Solar ETF has dropped 5% during the past year,
while the iSharesS&P Global Clean Energy Index ETF is down 8.2%.
Industrial Metals
Precious metals such as gold and silver get most of the attention, but industrial metals are better suited for
the scarcity trade. Gold, for instance, trades more as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk than on
supply and demand considerations.
Copper, however, is a key component of wire, switches, electromagnets and other industrial wares. The
metal has jumped 23% during the past 12 months, driven largely by growth in emerging-market nations.
China now imports 40% of the world's copper, up from less than 10% in 1996, according to Barclays Capital.
Supplies, meanwhile, have fallen well below their typical level of three weeks of consumption and will remain
below that for at least the next five years, according to Andy Mohinta, director of Citigroup Inc.'s mining and
steel research group. Other industrial metals facing shortages include lead and iron ore.
Paul Simon, chief investment officer of Tactical Allocation Group LLC, which has $1.1 billion under
management, likes precious and base metals as a way to play scarcity. "There are supply constraints and
seemingly insatiable demand in emerging markets," he says.
There is one ETF that buys futures contracts -- PowerShares DB Base Metals, which purchases aluminum,
zinc and copper and varies the contracts it buys to minimize contango.
Most industrial-metal products, however, are exchange-traded notes -- debt instruments that track specific
indices. These include iPath DJ-UBS Copper Total Return Sub-Index, iPath DJ-UBS Ind Metals TR Sub-Idx
and UBS E-Tracs CMCI Industrial Metals TR. ETNs typically do a good job of tracking the underlying index,
but can be less liquid than similar ETFs.
Other metals, like iron ore, don't have futures contracts, so investors are limited to the stocks of companies
that get a large portion of their profits from mining. Avy Hirshman, chief investment officer at Newgate Capital
Managment LLC, prefers Brazilian iron-ore producer Vale SA and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., which mines
iron-ore and coal.
"Both substances are scarce," Mr. Hirshman says, "and both are in demand."

Opportunity: Emerging markets clamor for metals to fuel economic growth; demand for copper is expected to
grow 4.5% in 2011.
Risk: World growth slows, reducing demand.
Strategy: Buy ETFs -- but look for funds that seek to minimize "contango."
WATER
Opportunity: Increasing demand collides with finite supply.
Risk: Lack of "pure plays" make profiting from water scarcity difficult.
Strategy: Buy water-themed ETFs.
ENERGY
Opportunity: The world needs more energy, but it is getting more expensive to produce. The cost of finding
new stores of oil has tripled since 2001.
Risk: Technology turns scarcity into a glut.
Strategy: Combine energy ETFs with shares of companies working to produce more energy.
AGRICULTURE
Opportunity: The world's population is expected to increase 36% by 2050 -- and those new mouths will need
food to eat.
Risk: Crops are subject to overplanting and sudden price swings.
Strategy: Buy companies that help farmers produce more at a lower price.

Global markets tumbled Tuesday, dragged down by rising concern that the high cost of raw materials is
eating into tight business and household budgets and undercutting prospects for economic growth.
Crude oil fell 3.3%, leading a broad reversal of the rally that had recently sent prices for copper, cotton and
other commodities to record highs.
Oil prices have now dropped 5.8% this week, after spiking in recent months amid Middle East unrest.
Oil's dip came after the International Energy Agency, which represents big oil-consuming nations, and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries both reported that demand is weakening amid high prices.
Saudi Arabia has cut back production after ratcheting it up just a few weeks ago amid fighting in Libya,
another major exporter.
Crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled on Tuesday at $106.25 a barrel, though prices are
still up 16% this year.
Stocks also dropped broadly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9%, its biggest daily drop in almost a
month.
Renewed worries about contamination from Japan's damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plant also
weighed on stocks.
Tokyo's Nikkei stock average dropped 1.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 1.3%, and Germany's DAX
declined 1.4%.
Surging prices for raw materials have been stoking rising fears of inflation in recent months.
But Tuesday's simultaneous drop in stocks, oil and other basic goods underscored another immediate threat:
that commodities have become too costly for cash-strapped customers still contending with high
unemployment.
Government data released Tuesday showing that U.S. exports fell in February for the first time since August
contributed to the worries and led many forecasters to reduce their economic-growth projections.
"The potential for a slowdown in the global growth story has finally come to fruition," said Jay Wong, principal
and equity portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel. "I'm not saying we're going to get a recession, but if you
look at range of growth estimates for the year, people are coming in more toward the bottom of the range. It
looks like expectations are on the muted side."
Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting group, cut its projection for first-quarter gross-domestic-product
growth from 2.1% to 1.5%, while Morgan Stanley analysts reduced their forecast from 1.9% to 1.5%. The
government will release first-quarter GDP data April 28.
For investors still struggling to gauge how the devastating earthquake in Japan and the continuing Middle
East turmoil may affect growth, the tepid trade data offered an early sign of the economy's persistent fragility.
The negative economic indicators, and words of caution from the IEA and OPEC, came as investors were
already digesting the recent commodity rally and weighing whether to take profits.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a commodity bull among Wall Street banks, on Monday recommended that
clients sell a basket of commodities that had risen sharply in recent months.

Prices for the handpicked basket, consisting of crude oil, copper, cotton, soybeans and platinum, had surged
25% on balance since Goldman recommended buying the commodities in December.
The basket hit Goldman's return target eight months earlier than expected.
"Even though we have not changed our fundamental views, prices have moved rapidly," David Greely, head
of energy research at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview Tuesday.
Tuesday's reversal also hit a range of commodities beyond oil, as investors sold out of hard assets that have
benefited for months from low interest rates and lingering fears of financial turmoil.
Copper prices dropped 1.7%, wheat plummeted 4.9%, cotton shed 2.4%, and gold prices dipped 1%.
"A lot of people are doing the exact same thing" as Goldman Sachs by concluding it is time to sell their own
commodity basket, said Nicholas Johnson, co-manager of Pimco's CommodityRealReturn Strategy Fund.
Even with the declines, many raw materials still cost significantly more than they did as recently as year end.
Corn, for instance, is up 20% this year.
"We are still very positive on many commodities on a fundamental basis over the long run," Goldman's Mr.
Greely said.
In its monthly report, OPEC cut its world oil-demand-growth forecast for 2011 by 50,000 barrels a day, though
it still forecasts world-wide demand to grow by 1.39 million barrels a day in 2011. OPEC said U.S. gasoline
sales fell by almost 1.3% in January, as people drove less and bought more efficient cars to make up for
higher fuel prices.
The IEA, meanwhile, on Tuesday kept its global oil-consumption estimates for 2011 unchanged but warned
that "preliminary January and February data suggest that high prices are already starting to dent demand
growth."
High oil prices may pose the greatest threat to global growth. U.S retail gasoline prices rose 11 cents last
week, to $3.79 a gallon, inching close to the level of $4 a gallon economists say will lead to cutbacks in
spending by consumers. Diesel fuel, a key transportation cost, already is more than $4 a gallon.
In the first quarter, average gasoline prices in the U.S. rose 20%, which translates into an additional expense
of about $150 per household, or a total increase in gasoline expenditures of $17 billion during the quarter, the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Friday.
Businesses paid an extra $1.2 billion a week on imported petroleum over the same period of 2010, the bank
said.

European markets advanced Friday, buoyed by solid gains for the mining sector as metal prices rose once
again.
The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 0.3% at 281.68, its 11th gain in the past 13 sessions. It had eased
0.3% on Thursday.
"There was relief in Asia after the tsunami warning was lifted and that carried on to the European markets,"
said Oliver Gilvarry, head of research at Dolmen Stockbrokers.
In LONDON, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 benchmark closed up 0.8% at 6055.75.
Miners advanced, helped by news that Rio Tinto had clinched a majority interest in long-pursued Riversdale
Mining, boosting chances its takeover offer will be approved. Rio shares rose 3.2%.
Gold prices rose once again as a weaker dollar and concerns about inflation led investors to seek refuge in
precious metals. Copper and silver prices also advanced. African Barrick Gold gained 3.4% and Randgold
Resources added 2.1%. Silver miner Fresnillo climbed 2.4%.
In FRANKFURT, the DAX 30 gained 0.5% to 7217.02, led by a 2.9% gain in exchange operator Deutsche
Boerse.
ICAP sagged 3.9% after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the interbank broker-dealer to "underperform" from
"neutral," citing the stock's full valuation.
In TOKYO, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average erased earlier losses to finish 1.8% higher at 9768.08 after a
7.1-magnitude earthquake in northeastern Japan Thursday night appeared to have caused little damage.
The jump helped the benchmark end with a weekly gain of 0.6%, its third consecutive weekly gain.
Shares of Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the March 11 earthquake-damaged Fukushima nuclear plant,
jumped 24%.
Fellow utility Tohoku Electric Power, which said Friday it had found water leaks at its Onagawa nuclear facility
and was forced to temporarily switch to an emergency diesel generator to power the cooling system at its
Aomori nuclear plant, erased early losses to finish 0.8% higher.
Fast Retailing, the operator of the Uniqlo casual-clothing chain, climbed 7.3% after the company raised its
profit outlook for the full business year ending in August.
"The summer merchandise sales season has only just gotten under way, and we think sales could easily
return to previous levels" by the Japanese Golden Week holiday between April 29 and May 5, Nomura
Securities analyst Masafumi Shoda wrote in a research note.
In SYDNEY, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7% to 4940.57, its highest close in nearly a year.
In MUMBAI, the Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensitive Index lost 139.73 points, or 0.7%, to close at 19451.40,
its fourth consecutive loss, as stocks fell on worries that corporate results might be pressured by high
commodity prices. Property developer DLF skidded 3.7% and Tata Motors dropped 2.8%.
"We expect strong sales growth of 25%-30% but higher raw material prices may take a toll on the bottom
line," analysts at Reliance Securities wrote in a note to clients, "Inflation remains high even after eight hikes
in interest rates in about a year," they said, adding that they expected the Reserve Bank of India to raise
lending rates by another 0.25 percentage point next month.

Among other markets, China's Shanghai Composite added 0.7% to 3030.02, its highest close since Nov. 11,
and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.5% to close at 24396.07, its sixth gain in the past seven trading
sessions and just 0.1% off its 2011 closing high.

Inflation Drives A Shift In Markets
Inflation Drives A Shift In Markets

After being pushed and pulled this year by tumult in the Middle East and the quake in Japan, the world's
financial markets are increasingly being driven by economic fundamentals, including inflation and interest
rates.
The winners in the shift have been precious metals and emerging-market currencies such as the Brazilian
real and the Korean won -- a sign of the growing split between healthier and still-sluggish quarters of the
global economy such as Japan, the U.S. and parts of Europe.
The shift is roiling markets around the world. Several currencies and precious metals hit all-time or multiyear
highs Friday. Some Asian governments intervened in the currency markets on two different days this week,
buying billions of dollars to drive down the value of their soaring currencies, traders said.
Gold hit a new record and posted its biggest weekly gain in a year. Silver closed above $40 an ounce Friday
for the first time in 31 years and has more than doubled over the past year.
Rising inflation is a key factor driving the emerging market currencies and precious metals.
"For the longest time, people were concerned that inflation would start to build to levels where central banks
are moved into action," says Mark Enman, head of global trading at Man Investments (USA) LLC. "That point
was somewhere on the horizon, and now the horizon is here."
Investors who believe inflation can be tamed are buying currencies in countries where central banks are
raising interest rates to control prices. So far this year, central banks in at least 18 developing economies
have raised interest rates, according to RBC Capital Markets.
That diverse list includes China, which raised rates this past week, along with Israel, Poland and Uruguay.
Brazil and India were virtually alone in raising rates last year.
Those higher rates make the currencies more attractive, leading to big flows of capital into those countries.
Brazil, after months of fighting the tide of money into the country, this week allowed its currency to rise
sharply to help its own fight against inflation. Other central banks, especially in Asia, continue to battle
investors who are bidding up the value of their currencies in order to protect the competitiveness of export
industries.
The impact of rates was a focus this week when the European Central Bank raised interest rates by
one-quarter of a percentage point, becoming the first central bank among the world's three major currencies
to boost rates.
The euro rose just over 1% against the dollar Friday, its biggest one-day gain since the start of the year, and
is up 1.65% over the past week.
The U.S. currency also lost 1.4% against the Australian dollar and was even weaker against the Brazilian
real, falling 2.7%.
The moves in gold and currencies come as economic officials are about to convene in Washington late next
week for the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Officials from the Group of Seven developed economies meet Thursday, and the broader Group of 20 talks
Friday.
High on the agendas is how the rest of the world will help Egypt and Tunisia revamp their economies. But
currencies are always part of the conversation in these meetings, both in private and public comments. The

wording of communiques is seen by officials and markets as a way for governments to send smoke signals to
investors and to pressure each other.
The dollar and yen are weakening against nearly all global currencies because the relatively slow economic
recoveries of America and Japan mean their central banks are unlikely to raise interest rates in coming
months.
After spiking to a record high after last month's Japanese earthquake, the yen has fallen more than 5%
against the dollar in the past three weeks -- a significant move for a major currency -- and fell more against
other currencies.
U.S. investors are worried about the Federal Reserve's "quantitative easing" plan of bond buying, which ends
in June.
In anticipation of lower demand for bonds from the Fed, they have been driving up the yields on U.S.
Treasurys, which rose to their highest level in a month. The possible shutdown of the U.S. government over
the budget impasse added to the anxiety.
The past few weeks have been a contrast to previous months, when worries about the European
governments defaulting on their debts or of upheaval in Middle Eastern countries had assets moving in
lock-step.
When fear was the prevailing emotion, the dollar rose, and when investors were less worried, riskier assets
ranging from the euro to oil to stocks took off.
Now, all different assets are moving based on their own fundamentals. U.S. stocks have continued to rise --
even as the dollar sinks -- because American corporations are profitable, strong and growing.

April 4-8
U.S.
-- The White House said alleged 9/11 plotters including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed will face military trials at
Guantanamo, scrapping efforts to try them in civilian courts. The move marked a significant reversal on an
issue that has vexed two successive administrations. Attorney General Holder blamed politics for the
continuing delay in bringing the defendants to justice. The undoing of the plan for a Manhattan trial came after
it was abandoned by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Charles Schumer.
-- The FBI has begun questioning Libyans living in the U.S. as part of an effort to identify any Tripoli-backed
spies or terrorists, and collect information useful to military operations. A similar effort targeting Iraqi-born
people in 2003 drew strong objections from the New York Civil Liberties Union.
-- The chancellor of the nation's largest school system is out after three months on the job, dealing an
embarrassing blow to New York Mayor Bloomberg. The short tenure of Cathleen Black -- a former chairman
of Hearst Magazines with no education experience -- was marred by a series of gaffes, the departure of
high-level deputies and low public-approval ratings.
---
Politics
-- Republicans and Democrats fought a two-front battle over Washington's role in the economy. The twin
fights -- one over funding the government for the next six months, the other over a sweeping plan to reshape
the government for decades to come -- show how far apart the parties are on basic fiscal issues. Efforts to
avert a shutdown over this year's spending came down to the wire after talks at the White House, which
included House Speaker Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Reid. The battle was broadened Tuesday with
the formal unveiling of the House Republican budget plan for next fiscal year, which calls for spending $6
trillion less over 10 years than President Obama proposes. The GOP blueprint, from Rep. Ryan, would
reshape Medicare and make dramatic changes to tax policies. It represents the most complete attempt so far
by Republicans to make good on their promises during the 2010 midterm elections to cut government
spending and deficits.
-- President Obama kicked off his re-election campaign with overtures to the grass-roots supporters key to his
2008 win. Mr. Obama became the first official candidate in the 2012 race, as the GOP nominating contest
shapes up more slowly than it did four years ago. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney appears to be
the early GOP front-runner, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Real-estate magnate
Donald Trump is making waves as an alternative.
-- A Wisconsin state Supreme Court race that could affect the outcome of Republican Gov. Scott Walker's
fight with unions turned in favor of the incumbent after the clerk of a conservative-leaning county reported she
failed to count thousands of ballots that largely favor David Prosser in his race against a Democratic-backed
challenger. She had led by about 200 votes before the discrepancy was detected.
-- The White House is considering a major national-security reshuffling that could see Central Intelligence
Agency Director Leon Panetta succeed Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Gen. David Petraeus take over
at the CIA, an administration official said.

-- Japan suffered its strongest tremors since last month's devastating earthquake, causing widespread power
outages through the north, shaking buildings as far away as Tokyo and putting the country on high alert again
for the safety of its nuclear-power plants. Hours earlier, the government said it was considering extending the
evacuation zone around its hobbled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex. The events heightened concerns
over the complex's short-term stability and raised questions over the long-term impact of radioactivity that
continues to issue from the plant. Japanese utility Tepco dumped water with low-level radiation into the ocean
and stopped a leak in a reactor pit. Authorities said they had discovered for the first time fish swimming off
Japan's Pacific coast carrying high levels of radioactive materials. The finding is stoking concerns about
environmental damage to local marine life and the safety of the nation's food supply, as well as the viability of
Japan's iconic seafood industry.
-- The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years, but sought to
reassure investors that it wouldn't embark on a rapid-fire series of increases that could disrupt fragile
economies in parts of the euro bloc. Despite those assurances, many analysts expect more increases to
follow, amid steadily rising inflation. Portugal said it would need as much as $129 billion under a bailout
package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, while Spain successfully sold $5.92
billion of a new three-year bond offering, in another indication that the country is dodging contagion from
financially stressed euro-zone countries.
-- Libyan rebels' frustrations grew as they claimed North American Treaty Organization airstrikes blasted their
forces outside the oil town of Brega, in another apparent mistake that sharply escalated anger about
coordination with the military alliance in efforts to cripple forces loyal to Col. Gadhafi. Earlier in the week,
rebels in eastern Libya took further steps toward establishing legitimacy, meeting with a U.S. envoy and
loading their first shipment of oil for export since the uprising began.
-- Karzai's office said the Afghan president plans to replace the defense and finance ministers, two cabinet
members seen as particularly close to the U.S. and allies.
-- Rio de Janeiro police confirmed at least 12 people were killed and at least 13 wounded in a shooting at a
public elementary school, allegedly by a former student.
---
Corporate
-- Boeing said its engineering and safety experts were caught off guard by last week's midair rupture in the
fuselage of a Southwest Airlines jet, failing to anticipate the risks of such an incident "until much, much later"
in the aircraft's life. In an attempt to explain what went wrong, a senior company engineer laid out some of the
decisions and analyses by the aerospace giant that unwittingly set the stage for the five-foot tear in the
aluminum skin of the 15-year-old Boeing 737 aircraft.
-- Google and the Justice Department were close to an agreement that would clear the search giant's $700
million acquisition of flight-data company ITA Software in return for granting federal regulators authority to
monitor a part of its operations, according to people familiar with the matter. Separately, Google is working on
a major overhaul of YouTube as it tries to position itself for the rise of televisions that let people watch online
video in their living rooms.
-- Dish Network's winning bid for Blockbuster could put the satellite-TV provider on a path to compete with
Netflix, although significant hurdles remain. Dish won a bankruptcy auction for the video-rental chain, offering
$320.6 million for Blockbuster's assets. Dish plans to utilize the assets to enhance Dish's subscription
offerings, leading some observers to predict it will start streaming video and shipping DVDs.
-- New mergers popped up across the globe -- including Texas Instruments' $6.5 billion purchase of National
Semiconductor, an unsolicited $6.5 billion offer by a state-owned Chinese mining company for a
Canadian-Australian firm, KKR's $2.4 billion deal for a Pfizer unit, and a consortium of Japanese metal
companies paying $680 million for Kentucky-based Arco Aluminum.
---
Markets
-- Federal securities regulators are moving toward easing decades-old constraints on share issues by private
companies, in a sweeping review that could remake the way American start-ups raise capital. The review by
the SEC could fuel the fast-growing market in private shares of technology firms such as Facebook Inc.,
Twitter Inc. and Zynga Inc. The steps under consideration would help such privately held companies raise
more money without incurring the increased reporting and other requirements of becoming a public company.
Such a move would lessen the amount of publicly available data about the companies at a time when
investors are seeking more market transparency.

-- Federal prosecutors disclosed charges in what they called one of the longest-running insider-trading
schemes ever discovered. The alleged scheme netted $32 million in profits, prosecutors said. A lawyer who
worked at two top mergers-and-acquisitions law firms is accused of obtaining secret information from the
firms and passing it to a go-between. That person allegedly handed it off to a trader, who is accused of
making the trades. The transactions involved some of the biggest tech deals of the decade, including Intel
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oracle Corp.
-- Apple will hold less sway over the Nasdaq starting next month as Nasdaq OMX Group said it would
rebalance its Nasdaq-100 stock-market index. The rebalancing will cut Apple's weighting in the index to 12%
from more than 20%. The move was partly driven by the rise in the tech company's shares, which are up
more than fourfold in the past two years.
-- Gold futures surged to another Comex record as investors continued to fret about global inflationary
pressures from rising oil prices. Silver, which has also been moving higher as a cheaper precious-metals
investment than gold, hit a 31-year high. Meanwhile, crude oil climbed to nearly $113 a barrel this week. The
Dow industrials managed to eke out a gain for the week, having fallen three of the past four days.
Wednesday, the benchmark settled at its highest close since June 2008.

How much more the U.S. spends on health care, per person, than the average OECD nation
At a time when politicians in Washington are battling over -- among other things -- the future of the U.S.
health-care system, it's instructive to see just how well that system operates. According to the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. spends far more on health care than any of the other
29 OECD nations, and gets less health for its money. Annual public and private health-care spending in the
U.S. stands at $7,538 a person, 2.41 times the OECD average. Meanwhile, average U.S. life expectancy is
77.9 years, less than the OECD average of 79.4. The OECD estimates that if the U.S. reached the efficiency
level of the best-performing countries, the government could save the equivalent of 2.7% of economic output
every year. That's enough to solve about a third of the U.S.'s budget-deficit problem.

NEW YORK -- Gold futures surged to a new record and silver hit a 31-year high as investors' desire for safe
havens trumped news that China had raised its interest rates to curb inflation.
The gold contract for April delivery rose $19.60, or 1.4%, to settle at a front-month peak of $1,451.80 a troy
ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The most actively traded contract, for
June delivery, rose $19.50, also 1.4%, to settle at a record $1,452.50.
"We're back to flight to quality in gold," said Michael Gross, a broker and futures analyst with
OptionSellers.com.
Market participants were nervous after Moody's Investors Service cut Portugal's long-term government-bond
rating and placed it on review for a possible downgrade, heightening concerns that lingering problems in the
euro zone will weaken the global economic recovery.
Meantime, fighting continued in Libya, whose 1.3 million barrels a day of exports have been cut off by the
conflict that erupted in mid-February.
Although oil futures fell Tuesday after China raised interest rates for the fourth time in less than six months,
Nymex May crude remained around $108 a barrel, continuing to cause worry that high oil prices will be a drag
on the economy. High energy prices also have sparked worries about rising inflation around the world, with
China's move highlighting efforts to head off problematic consumer-price increases.
Gold and silver are considered hedges against inflation. Comex April silver rose 69.1 cents, or 1.8%, to
settle Tuesday at $39.175, its highest finish since Jan. 21, 1980.

Our Unaccountable Fed
Our Unaccountable Fed
By Sean Fieler and Jeffrey Bell

Copyright 2011 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
'I will maintain to my deathbed that we made every effort to save Lehman, but we were just unable to do so
because of a lack of legal authority." So said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2009. The
statement was striking -- not because it was false, but because the Fed lacked explicit legal authority to do so
much of what it did during the financial crisis. Drawing the line at Lehman seemed arbitrary, and it proved that
the Fed has become an unaccountable power within American government.
Mr. Bernanke's insistence that the Fed is restrained by some obscure statute is central to his argument that
the Fed is a body subject to the check of external forces. But it's not. The principal check on its power is the
self-restraint of its chairman, a point proven by the Lehman example: Had Mr. Bernanke saved Lehman, who
would have enforced the statute that he had violated? No one. That's because the Fed, as currently
configured, has no opposing force to rein it in.
In the beginning, it was not so. When the Fed was created in 1913, the gold standard limited its power as did
the balance between the 12 reserve banks across the country and the Federal Reserve Board in Washington.
Lawmakers thought that the reserve banks would represent regional economic interests in tension with the
national political agenda of the board in Washington. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Act imposed a hard
constraint on the Fed's balance sheet: 40% of the Fed's notes had to be backed by gold. Finally, the Fed's
charter was temporary, lasting only 20 years before requiring congressional reauthorization.
These constraining forces began unraveling almost right away. During World War I, the Wilson administration
suspended and then restricted the dollar's convertibility into gold. In 1927, the Fed's charter was extended
indefinitely. In 1932, the Glass-Steagall Act effectively unmoored the Fed's balance sheet from gold by
allowing government bonds to serve as collateral against the issuance of Federal Reserve notes. And with
the passage of the Banking Act of 1935, the Fed's newly expanded powers were concentrated in the Federal
Reserve Board, at the expense of the reserve banks. Thus by the mid-1930s, the only remaining check on
the Fed's power was statutory.
Statutory supervision of government bureaucracies is usually workable because Congress maintains the
power of the purse. But the Fed, which can print money, has no budget constraint. Its profit and loss
statement doesn't matter because, unlike every other legal entity, its liabilities are irredeemable. Not having a
real budget means that the Fed doesn't have to compete with anyone for scarce resources.
Accordingly, Congress, banks and businesses -- institutions that would typically be skeptical of a government
bureaucracy's uncontrolled expansion -- are instead interested in capturing the Fed for their own purposes.
From the Long-Term Capital Management bailout in 1998 to the cleanup of 2008, Congress has come to rely
on the Fed's ability to act -- and thereby excuse Congress from having to vote on unpopular bailouts. What's
more, the government remains dependent on the Fed to help finance its debt going forward. Similarly, banks
and big corporations are potential beneficiaries of low-cost leverage and (in the wake of popped bubbles)
expedient bailouts.
Thanks to the tea party, there are increased numbers of reform-minded leaders in Congress willing to take on
big issues such as the Fed. But even those lawmakers who recognize the Fed's threat to liberty are
advocating narrow fixes, such as imposing the "single mandate" of price stability (and removing the Fed's
statutory responsibility for full employment). That alone wouldn't impose any meaningful check or balance on
the Fed's power.
If the history of the Fed proves anything, it is that no mere rule will take the fiat out of fiat money. And there is
no reason to believe that a single mandate would have stopped "quantitative easing." More importantly, what
would happen to the single mandate of price stability if and when the Fed violated it? At worst, Congress
would hold hearings and be very, very upset. Or it wouldn't do even that, because the most likely reason the
Fed would allow inflation to get out of control is to finance Congress's ever-growing budget deficits.

Members of Congress seeking to restrict the Fed's power need to consider what oppositional force is truly
capable of hemming it in. One answer is a revived gold standard, which would once again obligate the Fed to
redeem dollars for gold at a fixed rate.
Equally effective would be to leave the Fed and the dollar system untouched, but to allow gold a level playing
field on which to compete with the dollar. Utah has already taken the first step in this direction by passing a
law formally recognizing gold as legal tender. But for the playing field to be truly leveled, all taxes on gold
transactions need to be removed and individuals and businesses need to be permitted to report their financial
accounts in gold.
While it might not seem obvious to pit the dollar against gold, which has not been used as final money in over
100 years, it would provide a significant restraint on the Fed. Simply allowing gold to be used as currency
again would concentrate the minds of the Federal Reserve Board on keeping inflation under control.
Competition, after all, would mean that if the Fed doesn't preserve price stability, it will lose its monopoly
franchise -- not just get a tough talking-to from Congress.

U.S. News: Geithner Seeks Higher Debt Ceiling

Without congressional action, the federal government will hit its legal borrowing limit no later than May 16 and
could default on its debt by July 8, the Obama administration said Tuesday.
The warning came in a nine-page letter from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that marked the
administration's most detailed plea to Congress to raise the $14.294 trillion debt ceiling.
Failure to act could trigger "a financial crisis potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only
now starting to recover," said Mr. Geithner.
Among other things, the government could have to stop or delay paying government salaries and halt Social
Security and Medicare benefits. The impact could also reach financial markets and the operations of major
corporations.
The Treasury had $14.218 trillion in debt as of March 31.
In January, Mr. Geithner pleaded with Congress to raise the ceiling by the end of March, but Congress hasn't
moved to address the issue because of a split between Republicans and Democrats over how to proceed.
Many Republicans have flatly said they wouldn't vote to increase the debt ceiling, with others saying they
would only vote for an increase if it were coupled with significant spending cuts.
"Speaker Boehner has been perfectly clear: The American people will not tolerate an increase in the debt
ceiling without serious spending cuts and real reforms to make sure we keep cutting spending," said Michael
Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio).
The White House and many Democrats have said the debt-ceiling deliberations should be handled separately
from any broader debate about federal spending, in part because U.S. debt includes interest on money the
government has already spent and is akin to paying interest on an existing credit-card balance.
"It is critical that Congress act to increase the debt limit so that the full faith and credit of the United States is
protected," Mr. Geithner wrote in his letter Monday.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said the consequences would be "catastrophic" if the ceiling
isn't raised and the U.S. defaulted on its debt.
Hitting the ceiling would make it much harder for the government to fund its operations and do things like pay
interest on its debt. The government would likely face soaring borrowing costs as spooked investors
demanded higher returns on government debt.
Because the interest rates on many private loans are linked to Treasury yields, rates on mortgages and
corporate borrowing could surge as well.
Financial-market operations could be disrupted because Treasuries are used as collateral for many kinds of
borrowing, such as the short-term loans big banks take to finance their operations. If those credit markets
seized up, some companies might not have enough cash to make payrolls.
Treasury officials have spent months creating emergency plans they believe would free up an additional $165
billion in head room under the limit in case Congress delays any action. Mr. Geithner said it wasn't a "viable
option" to have Treasury move to sell financial assets, such as government gold, to delay congressional
action.
Instead, the Treasury would most likely draw down funds set aside for emergency lending, suspend the sales
of state and local government securities, and suspend payments into federal employee pension funds.

These moves might buy the government just eight weeks of time -- until about July 8 -- before it ultimately
defaulted.
"It would be tough making it past June 30," said Vincent Reinhart, former director of the Federal Reserve's
division of monetary affairs. Unless Congress raises the debt ceiling, "come August, they are toast."

NEW YORK -- A universal dislike of the dollar is driving investors into a wide variety of assets that historically
haven't been in demand at the same time.
Foreign-exchange traders and investment managers are making bets on an eye-catching combination of
assets -- from gold to Argentinian debt -- in an effort to avoid the low-yielding dollar. That is having the
incongruous effect of driving up so-called risk assets as well as those deemed to be safe havens.
"There's no support for the dollar, so [traders are] going anywhere but," said Dan Cook, chief executive officer
at IG Markets in Chicago.
A fragmented market with so many geopolitical uncertainties -- from unrest in Libya to the continuing attempts
to cool down a nuclear reactor in Japan -- has led certain investors to seek safety in some markets and
growth opportunities in others, all in the goal of finding better returns.
The antidollar trend could break if the Federal Reserve begins to tighten monetary policy. Federal Reserve
Bank of New York President William Dudley on Friday, however, warned against a premature change in
policy, saying that the economic recovery remains tenuous.
Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, N.Y., which manages about $500 million in assets, is buying
international bonds, including ones from normally risky countries like Argentina and Brazil. It also is holding a
basket of precious metals, which historically prosper as safe-haven investments.
"We don't want to own the U.S. dollar, or at least [we want to] lower our U.S. dollar exposure," said Oliver
Pursche, the company's president.
Yu-Dee Chang, principal and chief trader of ACE Investment Strategists in McLean, Va., which manages
about $160 million in assets, said he has taken a positive view on the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar.
But he is also buying gold "on the dips."
With gold's current strength, it's "heads you win, tails you also win," Mr. Chang said.
He said he profited from the Australian dollar's recent gains because he sold put options on the Australian
dollar in the middle of February.
Because the Australian dollar didn't fall to a level against the U.S. dollar that would trigger the sale, Mr.
Chang could book the cost of selling the option as a profit.
The options strategy returned 2.3%, better than the rate of return if he had just purchased the currency
outright.

Investing in Funds: A Quarterly Analysis --- Mixing It Up: Who's Afraid of Munis? --- Not adviser Dick
Bellmer, who's selectively bullish on tax-exempt bonds

Recent bad news about municipal bonds has created opportunities to buy them at lower prices, say advisers
at Deerfield Financial Advisors Inc. in Indianapolis.
Some attractive municipals have tax-exempt yields that, for a high-income taxpayer, would be equivalent to
around 5% on a taxable bond. And "where are you getting a 5% [taxable] yield with not a lot of risk?" says
Dick Bellmer, Deerfield's founder and president.
Municipal bonds are issued by states, cities and other agencies to finance public development such as roads,
airports and hospitals. The interest paid on these bonds is usually exempt from federal taxes, making them
very attractive for wealthy investors.
Since late last year, however, investors have been selling these bonds amid fears that cash-strapped states
and municipalities might not be able to make their bond payments. Large withdrawals from municipal-bond
mutual funds have further depressed prices.
Advisers at Deerfield say that these concerns are overblown and that the entire sector is getting maligned
unfairly. In general, they believe municipal bonds have a lower default risk than corporate bonds. Some types
of municipal bonds essentially carry no default risk -- like "pre-refunded bonds," whose principal and income
is typically secured by an irrevocable trust of U.S. Treasurys, says Mr. Bellmer. Even the price of those bonds
has fallen in recent months. "The baby got thrown out with the bath water," Mr. Bellmer says.
In this column, we feature model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds. Mr. Bellmer, 66 years old, founded Deerfield in 1985. He is a previous chairman of
the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, an organization of financial advisers who are paid
only by customer fees, not product commissions. Deerfield currently manages $500 million in assets,
primarily for individuals.
Mr. Bellmer says his investment team looks beyond the credit ratings of municipal bonds to determine the
potential for default. They look at "the underlying fundamentals of how the bond is set up and how it's going to
get paid," says Mr. Bellmer.
The Deerfield advisers like "essential service" revenue bonds, such as those backed by income generated
from water and sewer plants.
"Odds of a municipality being able to function without a sewer system are remote," says Brad Cougill, a
partner at Deerfield. If anything, these organizations have the ability to increase their fees when needed and
thus pay their bondholders, he says.
On the other hand, the likelihood of default on bonds issued by hospitals or for other economic development
is higher, says Mr. Bellmer.
Some pre-refunded and essential-service revenue municipal bonds currently offer yields of around 2% to 3%,
which is lower than high-yield munis. But the Deerfield advisers say buying the riskier munis would defeat the
purpose of owning bonds. "The whole premise is to be conservative," says Mr. Bellmer.
The main risk associated with their municipal-bond holdings is the lack of liquidity, or absence of buyers, says
Mr. Cougill. "Since we're planning to hold until maturity we don't have to worry about that," he says.
Here the advisers share a model portfolio used for clients in or near retirement, with a moderate risk appetite.
A typical client using such a portfolio earned nearly 15% through one year and 4.6% annually for the three
years ended Feb. 28, according to Mr. Bellmer.

--- Page 42 ---
Page 42 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The firm charges a fixed retainer fee for financial-planning services, which ranges from $2,500 to $10,000 a
year, plus an investment advisory fee of 0.75% or lower annually, depending on assets under management.
U.S. STOCKS: The Deerfield advisers expect that over the next several years, the U.S. stock market will
continue to be volatile and provide relatively low returns, somewhere in the "mid to high single digits," says
Mr. Bellmer.
The model portfolio has a 25% allocation to U.S. stocks, primarily through funds managed by Dimensional
Fund Advisors of Austin, Texas. Dimensional uses computerized screening to identify shares with certain risk
and return metrics, and then holds them until the metrics change.
Since DFA's fund managers aren't actively picking stocks to try to beat the market, these funds are usually
considered "passive" funds. Deerfield advisers say investors are better off in low-cost passive funds because
actively managed funds incur higher trading fees and charge high management fees.
"It's the asset [allocation] decision that is most important" says Mr. Cougill.
He believes that DFA is able to provide slightly better returns than the average index-tracking fund. Also,
since DFA funds are sold mostly through financial advisers, those who invest in them are in it for the long
term, he says. That's important, Mr. Cougill says, because when funds sell holdings to pay off departing
investors, it can hurt the remaining shareholders.
For large-company stocks, the model portfolio allocates 9% to the iShares S&P 500 Index ETF and 8% to
DFA U.S. Large Cap Value. Eight percent of the portfolio is in small-company stocks, with DFA U.S. Small
Cap and DFA U.S. Small Cap Value each getting a 4% allocation.
FOREIGN STOCKS: The 13% foreign-stock allocation hasn't changed in recent years.
The advisers allocate 3% each to two funds that invest in large-company stocks of developed foreign
countries -- DFA Large Cap International and DFA International Value.
For small-company foreign exposure, they put 2% each in DFA International Small Company and DFA
International Small Cap Value.
There's a 3% allocation to DFA Emerging Markets Core Equity, which invests in stocks of developing
countries.
BONDS: The 55% allocation to bonds is made primarily through individual bonds, almost all of which are high
quality.
Mr. Bellmer and his team create a "bond ladder" for clients -- buying bonds that mature at different times,
typically between two and six years. The advisers currently are using bonds with short-term and medium-term
maturities because they expect interest rates to rise, and they don't want to lock in current low interest rates
for a long period of time.
The advisers prefer buying individual bonds over bond mutual funds because it saves them a
fund-management fee and also gives them the certainty of planning an income stream for clients. Retired
clients live partly off the income generated by these bonds.
Mr. Cougill says laddered bonds were a buffer during the stock-market downturn of 2008-09 because
advisers could use the proceeds from maturing bonds to meet clients' cash requirements. Clients were
comforted by the fact that they didn't have to sell stocks at the bottom, says Mr. Cougill.
Even though bonds lost value during the downturn, the advisers held steady because their strategy is to hold
bonds until they mature.
The advisers put 23% of the portfolio in tax-exempt municipal bonds and 13% in taxable municipal bonds.
Taxable munis are issued by municipalities that would rather pay a higher interest rate than bear the expense
of getting tax-exempt status for their bonds, says Mr. Cougill. These bonds are owned in clients' tax-deferred
accounts, such as individual retirement accounts.
Fourteen percent of the portfolio is invested in individual U.S. government and agency bonds.
The only mutual fund in the bond portfolio is Loomis Sayles Bond, which buys everything from junk bonds to
foreign bonds. The advisers invested in the fund during the downturn in April 2009, when it had lost a lot of
value, because they believed it would bounce back. "We treat it as an equity [investment] in terms of risk,"
says Mr. Bellmer.

--- Page 43 ---
Page 43 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The fund gets a 5% allocation, and it has gained about 60% since the advisers bought it. Now that it has
achieved its purpose, the advisers say they are reviewing whether to sell it.
OTHER INVESTMENTS: The advisers allocate 7% of the portfolio to real-estate and commodity investments
they believe provide "access to additional return streams and diversification," says Mr. Cougill.
There is a 2% allocation to Vanguard REIT Index, which invests in real-estate investment trusts. These are
companies that purchase office buildings, hotels and other real-estate property.
Five percent is invested in Pimco CommodityRealReturn Strategy, which owns commodity index-linked
derivative instruments, as well as some inflation-linked bonds.
Mr. Bellmer says that while commodities such as gold and corn have gained a lot of value in recent months,
it's hard to predict whether that trend will continue over the next few years because so many factors can
affect commodities prices. He says those who try to predict commodity or any other long-term investment
returns "are whistling in the wind."

Dancing in the Glory of Monsters

The Fear: Robert Mugabe and The Martyrdom of Zimbabwe
By Peter Godwin
Little, Brown, 371 pages, $26.99
As North Africa and the Arab states undergo an awakening being widely welcomed around the globe, it's
worth pondering the outcome of what South Africa's Thabo Mbeki liked to call the "African Renaissance." In
the late 1980s, and throughout the 1990s, in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and elsewhere, a new
generation of leaders -- Western in mindset, free market in outlook -- overthrew an old guard of African Big
Men. Nelson Mandela came to power in South Africa at the same time, and a popular democratic opposition
even arose in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. U.S. Secretary of State Madeline Albright gushed in 1997:
"Africa's best new leaders have brought a new spirit of hope and accomplishment to your countries -- and that
spirit is sweeping the continent."
Yet two new books show how badly the anti-authoritarian movements -- and grand plans -- have played out.
The books are wildly different. In "The Fear," Peter Godwin reports on the victims of the Mugabe regime's
vicious assault on the democratic opponents who defeated him in elections in 2008, while Jason K. Stearns's
"Dancing in the Glory of Monsters" is an authoritative look at the war that began in Congo in 1996 and that
eventually involved nine countries and 20 different rebel movements, resulting in the deaths of more than five
million people. In sheer brutality, this mostly unremarked upon cataclysm ranks with the two world wars, the
Great Leap Forward and the Cambodia genocide.
The war in Congo -- a hollowed-out state that has known little but slavery, colonialism and dictatorship for
four centuries -- started not as a civil war but, Mr. Stearns notes, as "a regional war, pitting a new generation
of young visionary African leaders against Mobutu Sese Seko, the continent's dinosaur." Its catalyst,
moreover, was self-defense. It was planned and fought by Congo's tiny neighbor, Rwanda, a country smaller
than Massachusetts, as a direct result of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which 800,000 mostly Tutsi
Rwandans had been slaughtered in 100 days by the majority Hutu.
By 1996, as Mr. Stearns tells it, the Tutsi-led rebel movement that had overthrown the Hutu regime was firmly
established in power and had turned its attention on the Rwandan Hutus settled in sprawling refugee camps
in the eastern Congo. Genuine refugees lived side by side with genocidaires, all fed and cared for by eager
battalions of Western aid groups whose governments had notoriously failed to intervene to stop the killing.
Wary that another war or genocide could be plotted in the camps, Rwanda chose pre-emption.
They couldn't maintain international legitimacy by invading a sovereign country, so, on the advice of their
Ugandan allies, the Rwandans put together a rag-tag band of anti-Mobutu rebels to front the operation --
among them the washed-up old revolutionary Laurent Kabila, whom Che Guevara had tried (and failed) to
train in the art of war. Ethnic Tutsis from eastern Congo made up other parts of what the Rwandans named
the ADFL, or Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (as Congo was then known). After
some bonding sessions in Rwanda -- "the Rwandans are weird," one rebel leader tells Mr. Stearns, "they
wanted us to become a team" -- the war began in September 1996.
The invasion force included Ugandan artillery units, Eritrean speedboats, Tanzanian military advisers and
Congolese rebels. Angola lent a unit of Katangans who wore magic amulets to deflect bullets. Zimbabwe

provided money and arms. By May 1997 the rebels had advanced 1,000 miles through the jungles of Congo,
all the way to Kinshasa, and had overthrown Mobutu. Laurent Kabila, who had last been in the capital in the
1960s when it was still Leopoldville, and didn't recognize the place, was the new president. As military
operations go, this was as impressive as Desert Storm. But the trouble had just begun.
Mr. Stearns, an American, lived for 10 years in Congo -- including three years during the war -- working for
the United Nations and human-rights groups. But don't let that put you off. This is no dull policy document. He
is a cracking writer, with a wry sense of understatement. Remarking of an earnest, Sartre-quoting
political-science professor who leads a second rebellion -- but ends up penniless in a slum -- he notes: "The
Congo has always defied the idealists."
Mr. Stearns has spoken to everyone -- villagers, child soldiers, Mobutu's commanders, Kabila's ministers,
Rwandan intelligence officers. In these conversations he found gold, bringing clarity -- and humanity -- to a
place that usually seems inexplicable and barbaric. "Dancing in the Glory of Monsters" is riveting and certain
to become essential reading for anyone looking to understand Central Africa.
As Mr. Stearns makes clear, there were wars within wars. While many Congolese had an ethnic hatred for
the Tutsi (stoked by Mobutu), after 40 years of the tyrant they welcomed the rebels as liberators. Besides, the
state had decayed so much under Mobutu that the Congolese could hardly fight back: The air force had sold
the last of its planes to arms dealers; soldiers flogged their weapons to their enemies. Meanwhile, Rwandan
troops and their ADFL allies dealt with the refugees. Hundreds of thousands of Hutus fled the camps ("like
walking corpses") into the jungles and were hunted down. One aid group has equated the slaughter to a
second genocide, but the true numbers are obscure. Mr. Stearns is careful with figures, but he leaves no
doubt that at least tens of thousands were systematically killed by the Rwandans, and as many died of
disease and starvation while on the run.
Inevitably, Kabila turned out to be little better than Mobutu -- political parties were immediately suspended
and criticism of the government was met with imprisonment or worse. Kabila was paranoid, and having come
to power on the back of the Rwandans, he soon turned against them. Thus the Rwandans, who had agents in
place in the upper echelons of his military, decided to replace their unruly puppet, and in August 1998 another
war broke out.
In what must be one of the most outrageous scenes in any war chronicle, Mr. Stearns describes Kabila
summoning his information minister -- a 36-year-old writer named Didier Mumengi, who had spent most of his
life in exiled comfort in Brussels -- to the presidential helipad behind the palace as mortar shells fall around
them. Unconcerned, Kabila assures his ward that Rwanda can never defeat Congo. "Can a toad swallow an
elephant? No!" Then he instructs him to go on the radio to rally the people. "We don't have an army so we will
need them. In the meantime I will go look for allies." He hands Mr. Mumengi a pistol. "Here, you must use
this. From today on you will be minister of war!"
This second war split the alliance. Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to prop up Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda
sought to replace him. They ended up fighting one another. There was old-fashioned trench warfare on the
rolling savannas of Katanga province, where the Belgians once had sprawling cattle ranches: Rwandans and
Burundians battling Hutus and Zimbabweans, hundreds of miles from their home countries.
The second war was all about control of resources -- Congo's vast reserves of diamonds, copper and cobalt
-- and Mr. Stearns is brilliant on who pillaged what and how. Ugandan diamond exports grew 10-fold after
1998 -- even though the country has no diamonds of its own. The Christmas 2000 release of Sony
Playstation 2 was a boon to the trade in coltan, a native mineral used in electronic capacitors. Rwandan
exports soared to more than $150 million. President Paul Kagame himself described the Rwandan
involvement in Congo as "self-sustaining."
It was Kabila's assassination in January 2001, by one of his bodyguards, and his son Joseph's rise to power
that finally brought about a peace deal in 2003. The son was a pragmatist, and besides, Zimbabwe and
Angola wanted out. As for Rwanda and Uganda, they were having trouble justifying a war of self-defense so
far from their borders. Even today, though, small wars still play out in the eastern parts of Congo, and the
duration of the conflict is indefinable.
"Dancing" isn't a perfect book. It can be confusing, jumping back and forth among time periods, and the
histories of the roots of ethnic grievance in the east are overlong. But Mr. Stearns never settles for easy
answers. Near the end of the book, he visits the scene of one of the worst massacres in the second war,
committed by Rwandan-backed rebels in the east in 1998. More than 1,000 villagers were slaughtered, their
bodies mutilated, their entrails cut out.
Mr. Stearns interviews a survivor: "It was like they killed them. And killed them again," he is told. But then he
asks the villagers about the Mai Mai -- the local militia who fought and provoked the Rwandan rebels. The
villagers shake their heads: "They were just as bad!" Then he asks a group of a dozen women for their story.

--- Page 46 ---

Slowly they step forward. They have all been raped, they tell him -- by men from their own village. Mr.
Stearns explains at the outset that he is writing about perpetrators, but in central Africa, it seems, victims and
perpetrators are interchangeable.
Zimbabwe was deeply involved in both wars, and this costly intervention had serious repercussions for
Robert Mugabe. In 2000, amid food riots and rising unemployment, an attempt to alter the country's
constitution to extend his rule was rejected by voters. Mr. Mugabe lashed out, invading mainly white-owned
commercial farms to win back popular support. It was a disaster, wiping out agriculture, the country's main
source of revenue.
Faced with a dismal economy, Mr. Mugabe was eventually forced to withdraw his troops from the Congo, but
by now the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) had momentum. Although in 2002 and 2005
Mr. Mugabe rigged ballots to stay in power (with "Renaissance" man Thabo Mbeki's full support), by 2008,
with shops empty and inflation out of control, something had to give. It did. In an extraordinary election in
March 2008, Zimbabweans voted Mr. Mugabe out. With the results clear but still unofficial, Peter Godwin flew
into Zimbabwe "to dance on Mugabe's political grave."
It didn't work out like that. Mr. Mugabe massaged the presidential ballot to force a run-off, and then the terror
began. Opposition activists started popping up in Harare hospitals, the victims of beatings and torture in a
campaign known as "The Fear." Mr. Godwin was there to record their stories, and the descriptions are
gruesome: shattered bones, bloodied faces, lacerated skin, feet beaten raw. While the killings in Congo
appear part of a lawless land, those in Zimbabwe were planned, coordinated, precise. The intention was to
punish those who voted against Mr. Mugabe -- and to ensure that they voted the right way in the run-off. It
worked. Mr. Mugabe remains president.
This is the third memoir of his country by Mr. Godwin, a Zimbabwe-born, New York-based journalist. He has a
Zelig-like knack for being there at the right time. He is on first-name terms with leaders of the Movement for
Democratic Change, and gives an intriguing insider's account of the back-and-forth behind MDC leader
Morgan Tsvangirai's decision to join a unity government with Mr. Mugabe: He agrees to go into it without
consulting his deputies, Tendai Biti and Roy Bennett, who were strongly opposed. As a Zimbabwean, I had a
sinking feeling reading this: Mr. Mugabe is running rings around these people.
The trouble with "The Fear" is that Mr. Godwin seems unsure whether he is writing another memoir or a piece
of hardcore reportage that could be the last word on Mr. Mugabe's violence. He is accompanied in the book
by his sister, Georgina, an accomplished broadcaster, but she's mostly used for punch lines between his
serious accounts of Mr. Mugabe's victims. He carries out dozens of interviews, but unlike Mr. Stearns, he
hasn't got the time -- or perhaps the security -- to learn more about the men carrying out the atrocities. He
speaks to no one from the other side.
The point is not that there are "two sides to every story" -- I don't believe there are in this case. But it would
be good to know, as Mr. Stearns shows us, what compels these men to take machetes to their neighbors. Are
they paid? Do they feel remorse? Shame? "The Fear" is an important book, not least because Mr. Godwin
names names -- of rapists, torturers and killers -- and one hopes that they get what's coming to them. In
cataloging the victims, he shows the extraordinary courage of those standing up to Mr. Mugabe. But in the
end the book feels fragmented and rushed, less than the sum of its parts.
The biggest fear, meanwhile, is that the worst may still be to come. It is three years since that 2008 election
and Robert Mugabe is not only still in power but resurgent. Another election is on the way, and flush with
cash from diamonds in the east, he is again unleashing violence on his opponents. If the stories of Central
Africa and Zimbabwe are anything to go by, one has to wonder about those contemporary revolutions to the
north: Is the current chaos only the beginning?

After a year often spent as an afterthought, oil is back as the king of commodities, capable of helping dictate
what happens next in broad swaths of the economy.
Fighting in Libya in mid-February jarred the world awake to the risk that key oil supplies could be cut off,
spurring a rally that sent oil prices up 25% in 13 trading days -- the fastest such leap in almost two years.
Earlier unrest this year had largely been confined to countries that don't export much oil.
In early March, prices settled above $100 a barrel for the first time since the record-breaking year of 2008 and
have scarcely looked back, except for a two-day dip below that attention-getting threshold in the wake of the
earthquake in Japan.
The price spike marks a startling departure from 2010, when oil prices largely stayed between $70 and $90
and were seen as only a minor threat to growth, compared with soaring prices for a variety of commodities,
from corn to copper.
Oil rose 16.79% in this year's first quarter, compared with a 15.15% gain in all of 2010.
The shift is changing investor attitudes. Respondents to an early-December survey by Barclays Capital
ranked oil third among commodities likely to rise most in 2011. But oil topped a similar Barclays survey,
conducted in March, in London.
The surge doesn't seem to have cut the world's appetite for oil yet. But inventories are shrinking, and so are
estimates of how much more crude could be easily pumped out if, for instance, Middle East unrest further
disrupts supplies.
That means the buffer against another big spike is thinning. "We haven't seen a slowdown in demand at all,
even at these price levels," said Amrita Sen, an oil-market analyst at Barclays. "It's quite scary."
Oil prices are still well below the record near $145 a barrel, hit in 2008. But there is concern about further
increases because, when oil suddenly gets more expensive, it can drag down economic growth significantly.
The return of oil to center stage also has far-reaching implications for other commodity markets, because
energy is a major input cost for producing other materials and, if pricier oil slows the economy, demand for
other goods can take a hit as well.
But any impact so far is uneven, which may reflect uncertainty about what will happen in the Middle East,
Japan and the European Union, which continues to struggle with domestic financial concerns.
In the first quarter, commodity prices were mixed across the board. The Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index,
which tracks 19 markets from crude to coffee, rose 4.4% in the quarter. That's a relatively tame increase
compared with the 11.6% leap in last year's third quarter and a 15.8% jump in the fourth.
In some cases, events that pushed oil prices up had the opposite effect on other commodity markets.
The escalation of the Libyan conflict, for instance, stirred concerns about the broader economic impact that
could shake out globally. Stephen Briggs, a metals-markets analyst at BNP Paribas, said there was a roughly
10% correction in the prices for many industrial metals.
"The fear was that would slow down the economy and therefore slow metals demand," he said. Revived
concerns about euro-zone economies are another reason for worry, he said. "We're not out of the woods on
any of this stuff."

China's move to tighten the reserve requirements for its banks -- its latest effort to tame growth by slowing
lending -- also had an impact, given the major role Chinese demand plays in the commodities markets. And
investors pulled money out of some risky assets in a defensive move amid developments in the Middle East
and Japan.
But the prices for individual commodities diverged, at least in part because those unfolding events could have
differing impacts on supply and demand.
Palladium, for instance, fell 4.4% in the quarter. The metal is widely used in making car engines, and prices
began to drop just as oil spiked, then dropped further after the Japanese quake, which clouded the outlook for
makers of automobile parts.
Aluminum, on the other hand, jumped 6.6% in the quarter. Mr. Briggs noted that prices have recovered from
the financial crisis more slowly than copper and some other industrial metals, and as such had more room to
climb. Moreover, aluminum is the only one of those metals that is widely produced in the Middle East, so
unrest there poses a greater risk to supplies, he said.
Agricultural commodities also took different paths. Corn and cotton added to last year's strong gains, with
corn rising 10.2% and cotton shooting up 38.3%.
Demand from China and concerns about tight supplies both propelled the gains.
But wheat prices fell 3.9% in the quarter after last year's 47% rise. If that trend continues, it could ease some
of the global concern over food inflation.
Gold, meanwhile, reached a record high in nominal terms, but actually spent much of the quarter in negative
territory because of a January pullback. Instead of shooting up at the height of the crises -- as they often do --
gold prices logged only modest gains.
The yellow metal closed the quarter at a record of $1,438.90, up 1.3% -- still its second-weakest quarter since
2008.

March 21-25
World
-- The 28 NATO nations agreed that the alliance would take over command of the operation to enforce a
no-fly zone over Libya, a move the U.S. had advocated. NATO is expected to agree to expand its role to take
the lead in all military operations in Libya soon. Military commanders have said the focus of U.S. and coalition
air patrols had shifted from only enforcing a no-fly zone to hitting the Gadhafi regime's ground forces where
they are poised to attack civilians. But as the coalition of nations fighting Gadhafi continued to pound targets,
airstrikes on his ground forces have so far failed to end their siege of the key western city of Misrata,
prompting residents to flee. Russia's former ambassador to Libya said Gadhafi, who remained defiant in
televised addresses, is surrounded by aides willing to fight with him to the end, but can't hold off Western-led
forces for more than a few months. The U.S. is considering providing arms to Libyan rebels, a senior U.S.
diplomat said.
-- Japanese officials said a breach involving one reactor at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power
complex was responsible for a dangerous radiation leak. That further complicated the protracted and perilous
efforts to bring the plant under control, even as workers failed to restore cooling systems at the six-reactor
complex, a key goal. Revelations that the facility has a history of mechanical and operational flaws, and
regulators' having ignored the vulnerability at existing reactors, came to light. Tokyo Electric Power, which
operates the stricken plant, is seeking about $25 billion in loans for repairs at power stations damaged by the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami. The government, already weighed down with debt, said damage from the
disaster could reach $300 billion. More countries are blocking the import of food products from the Japanese
prefectures hit by the nuclear crisis, as the government found more radioactive materials in food and drinking
water. A government official said Japan had little choice but to expand nuclear power, saying the alternative
is "blackouts."
-- Bahrain warned Iran that an escalation in the dispute over its crackdown on a Shiite uprising could lead to
"conflict." Iran, a supporter of Shiite movements in Iraq and Lebanon, has denounced the Sunni-ruled
kingdom's decision to allow Saudi troops into the country to help suppress protests calling for the monarchy's
downfall. Thousands of protesters demanding political liberalization marched in cities across Syria Friday, an
unprecedented display of public dissent that sparked violent clashes with security forces and left dozens dead
and injured, according to witnesses and news media reports. Rocket attacks by Gaza militants on Israeli
cities followed a bombing in Jerusalem that killed one, rocket attacks in Beersheba and Ashdod, and the
killing of four Palestinian civilians. Israel appeared to be limiting its fire in an effort to avoid a broader conflict
with Hamas that could feed into the unrest sweeping the Arab world.
-- Yemen's president and the country's leading general are hitting snags on an attempted political settlement
in which both would resign in favor of a civilian-led transitional government. President Saleh has lost the
support of more than half the country's top military commanders and powerful tribal and religious leaders. The
political crisis escalated this week amid bloody crackdowns against protesters and new laws that suspend the
constitution and provide for the arrest of opponents.
-- Portugal's premier resigned after opposition parties voted down an austerity package, pushing borrowing
costs to unaffordable levels and threatening to force the country to follow Greece and Ireland in seeking a
bailout. Portugal's plight now puts Spain into the bailout spotlight.
-- Canada's opposition parties toppled the ruling Conservative minority government of Harper in a historic
parliamentary finding of contempt, which doubled as a vote of no confidence and set the stage for the
country's fourth national election in seven years.

-- BP came within 1.4 inches of preventing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, engineers hired by U.S.
investigators said in a new report, blaming the design of the well's blowout preventer rather than misuse or
maintenance. They found that the force of the explosion in last year's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf
of Mexico bent the drill pipe, knocking it off center and jamming shears meant to cut through pipe and seal
the well. Drilling rigs around the world depend on blowout preventers, most with the same basic design as the
Deepwater Horizon's. The report helps BP. A separate finding thwarted BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley's
efforts to revive the company's fortunes in the aftermath of the spill, as an arbitration tribunal blocked its $16
billion partnership with Russian state-run oil company Rosneft to explore for oil in the Arctic. The decision
could also mark a setback for Igor Sechin, Russia's powerful deputy prime minister and Rosneft chairman,
who has sought to attract billions of dollars of foreign investment into Russia's oil sector and who placed his
personal imprimatur on the deal.
-- The Hispanic population grew faster than expected and accounted for more than half of the nation's growth
over the past decade, with the group's increase driven by births and immigration, the Census Bureau said.
Meanwhile, in Detroit, the flight of middle-class African-Americans from the city to the suburbs fueled an
exodus that slashed the city's population by 25% in the past decade to 713,777, according to new Census
Bureau data, the city's lowest population level since the 1910 census.
-- Bernanke in April will start holding quarterly, televised news conferences, in the Federal Reserve's latest
effort to better explain its actions.
-- Sales of previously owned home fell 9.6% in February, with the median price, $156,100, the lowest in nine
years. That could bring steep discounts, which with low interest rates could finally push some buyers off the
fence as the real estate industry prepares for its busiest season. Over in the commercial real estate market,
moves by budget-minded governments to cut back on office space are dragging on the sector's recovery. The
biggest impact is likely to come at the state and local levels.
-- A prosecutor in the criminal case against Barry Bonds said people close to the retired baseball slugger
would testify that he knowingly used steroids and that they changed his body. His is the highest-profile case
stemming from a seven-year government probe of sports doping that has ensnared Olympic gold-medalists,
track coaches and others.
---
Politics
-- The Obama administration has revised rules to let investigators hold domestic-terror suspects longer than
others without giving them a Miranda warning in "exceptional cases," significantly expanding exceptions to
the instructions that have governed the handling of criminal suspects for more than four decades. The rules
mark another step back from pre-election criticism of unorthodox counterterror methods.
-- Social Security's disability fund will run out in four to seven years without federal intervention, according to
government auditors. Separately, public employees are retiring at a quickening pace around the country,
fearful of losing benefits that state and local governments are targeting. It's a mixed blessing for the
governments, which need to save money but rely on these veterans to maintain the quality of their public
services.
-- Former Minnesota Gov. Pawlenty formed a presidential exploratory committee, taking a formal step that
could prompt other Republicans to declare their intentions. Most polls show his national support in the low
single digits, behind Palin and Gingrich and far behind Huckabee and Romney, who has begun a 15-city push
to secure commitments from the big-money fund-raisers known as bundlers.
-- The effort in Ohio to restrict union rights is being scaled back on concerns it is vulnerable to legal
challenges and a backlash by voters.

Business
-- AT&T said it would buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion in cash and stock, a move
that would create the largest wireless carrier in the U.S., with nearly 130 million customers, and shift the
competitive landscape of the American industry. In stitching together the second- and fourth-largest U.S.
mobile carriers, AT&T is showing a fearless attitude toward U.S. regulators, who will be carefully scrutinizing
the largest planned merger deal of 2011. T-Mobile has long been an antagonist of AT&T and chief rival
Verizon Wireless, offering low prices that have kept pressure on rates. The combined carriers would be able

to make an estimated $40 billion in cost cuts, AT&T said. The moves would probably involve thousands of job
losses.
-- NRG Energy said its plans to build two big reactors at its South Texas nuclear plant could be delayed or
even canceled in light of earthquake-related failures at a Japanese nuclear plant. Any setback would be the
most tangible repercussion so far on the U.S. nuclear industry from the nuclear-plant disaster in Japan.
Separately, the shutdown of two factories by Japan's earthquake took out a quarter of the world's supply of
silicon wafers, the building blocks of computer chips. Inventories of the wafers, as well as another important
product -- BT resin, used to make printed circuit boards -- each seem to be holding up, but other disruptions
had a more immediate impact. The world's auto makers, for instance, have had trouble coping with the
shutdown of a Hitachi factory north of Tokyo that makes airflow sensors used to measure the amount of air
coming into engines.
-- Google's six-year struggle to bring all the world's books to the Internet suffered another big setback at the
hands of a federal judge in Manhattan. The judge rejected a 2008 settlement that Google forged with authors
and publishers to make millions of books available online.
-- Research In Motion posted a 32% jump in quarterly profit, but the BlackBerry maker warned of lower
earnings and revenue in the current period. The Waterloo, Ontario, company also said it plans to allow
Android applications to run on its PlayBook tablet computer, due out next month. The move will greatly
expand the number of apps available on the PlayBook.
-- Groupon's president and chief operating officer said he is stepping down from his position at the
fast-growing Internet company in the coming months.
-- ConocoPhillips said it will sell an additional $5 billion to $10 billion in assets over the next two years and
said it will use the proceeds to fund its buyback and capital-spending programs. Chief Executive Jim Mulva
said the company plans to sell a total of $12 billion to $17 billion in assets in a three-year period, including at
least $1 billion in refining and marketing properties this year.
---
Markets
-- Federal regulators are blaming Wall Street's biggest firms for the collapse of five institutions at the heart of
the nation's credit-union industry and are seeking to recoup tens of billions in losses on securities that
doomed the five. The National Credit Union Administration has threatened to sue Goldman Sachs Group,
Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase unless they refund more than $50
billion of mortgage-backed securities sold to the five institutions, as regulators flex their legal muscles against
executives, directors and outsiders blamed for the demise of financial institutions during the crisis. In other
derivatives news, Fannie Mae was warned in a 2006 internal report of abuses in the way lenders and their
law firms handled foreclosures, long before regulators launched investigations into the mortgage industry's
practices. The report could add ammunition to those calling for stronger regulation of mortgage servicers. And
in Germany, the nation's highest civil court ruled that Deutsche Bank failed to properly advise a client of the
risks of interest-rate swaps, in a verdict that could trigger a host of judgments against the bank and lead to
greater restrictions in the sale of derivatives in that nation. The ruling is likely to ripple across Germany's
banking sector and could force lenders to divulge more information about the risks of such products.
-- Gold prices hit another Comex record and oil surpassed $105 a barrel this week, spurred on by turmoil in
Libya and the Middle East. Investors worry that high crude prices could temper the economic recovery,
adding to gold's allure. The Dow industrials advanced 3.1% on the week, ending at 12220.59, its biggest
weekly percentage gain since July. Japan's Nikkei climbed 3.6%, its best weekly performance since
November.
-- Citigroup will reinstate its dividend at a penny a share after a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. Without the split,
the payout would have been just one-tenth of a cent. The move comes after the Fed allowed some banks to
resume dividends for the first time since the financial crisis. Bank of America was the first lender to
acknowledge that it didn't receive approval to raise its dividend.

By the Numbers
Number of the Week: 100%
Increase in the number of anti-government protests associated with a 10% rise in global food prices.

Despotic leaders, entrenched inequality and new forms of communication have all played a role in the
political turmoil now shaking the Middle East. New research by economists at the International Monetary
Fund points to another likely contributor: global food prices. Looking at food prices and instances of political
unrest from 1970 through 2007, the economists find a significant relationship between the two in low-income
countries, a group that includes Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan and Yemen. To be exact, a 10% increase in
international food prices corresponds to 0.5 more anti-government protests over the following year in the
low-income world, a twofold increase from the annual average. Given the recent trend in food prices, leaders
of low-income countries, including China, might have reason for concern. In February, global food prices were
up 61% from their most recent low in December 2008, according to the IMF.

Analyst Peter Ferrara writing at the American Spectator online, March 23:
For two years now, I have been arguing . . . that President Obama's economic policies were a throwback to
the 1970s, and so were going to produce the same result as the 1970s -- the worsening cycles of inflation
and recession known as stagflation. With last week's reports regarding the Producer Price Index and the
Consumer Price Index, those results are now here.
But these developments are just several further spins in an accelerating downward spiral for America that
leaves our traditional prosperity, high standard of living, and national security extremely vulnerable to three
looming disasters, at least two of which are likely to happen within the reasonably near future.
The Producer Price Index rose 1.6% in February, an annual pace of nearly 20%. Over the last 5 months, the
index has increased by nearly 5%, an annual pace of over 10%. The index for food increased by nearly 4% in
February alone, the largest one month rise since November, 1974. . . .
This trend is now beginning to show up in the Consumer Price Index as well . . . [and] the CPI is arguably
understating inflation today because 40% of it is now represented by housing, which is still in a recession.
This follows a long-term trend that has been flashing red for inflation for quite some time now. First gold
started to rise, eventually to record highs. Then the dollar started to fall, now near record lows. Then
commodity prices started to soar, with oil now zooming over $100 a barrel.
Under supply-side economics, the Fed is supposed to tighten monetary policy when these
inflation-sensitive market prices first start to accelerate. Once the CPI starts spiking at 5-7%, the necessary
tightening to stop it will cause sharply rising interest rates, and recession a year or so later. But if the Fed
doesn't reverse course, and continues printing money excessively, inflation will just continue to accelerate.
To stop the 1970s double-digit inflation, the Fed finally had to impose double-digit interest rates for over a
year, which caused the sharp 1982 recession.

Gold Hits a Record, Fueled by Oil, Mideast

Gold Hits a Record, Fueled by Oil, Mideast

Turmoil in the Middle East helped drive gains in gold and oil futures, with the precious metal settling at an
all-time high.
Light, sweet crude for May delivery rose to a 2 1/2-year high on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which
helped send gold prices surging as investors worried high crude-oil prices would temper the global economic
recovery. Rising oil prices also could spur inflation, against which gold is considered a hedge.
The U.S. and its allies continued to pound forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi in Libya, where 1.3 million
barrels a day of oil exports have been sealed off by the fighting and Western sanctions. Market participants
have been gripped by uncertainty over how long the fighting will last and are bracing for the likelihood that
Libyan oil remains off the market for an extended time.
Meanwhile, reports that Syrian security forces opened fire on antiregime protesters in the southern town of
Daraa, killing five, renewed fears that the unrest could spread to other major oil producers. Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest crude exporter, has raised production to help offset the shortfall of Libyan crude.
"If this spreads into Saudi Arabia, $120 a barrel is going to look cheap," said Kyle Cooper, managing partner
at IAF Energy Advisors in Houston. "People are scared to death to be short."
Saudi King Abdullah has unveiled $93 billion in economic benefits and an April municipal election to help the
kingdom avert unrest, but analysts said the steps won't resolve the kind of youth-unemployment issues that
have fueled revolt elsewhere in the Arab world.
Investors sought safety in precious metals. The price of the gold for March delivery rose $10.40, or 0.7%, to
$1,437.90 a troy ounce, a front-month record settlement, on the Comex division of the Nymex. The most
actively traded contract, for April delivery, rose $10.40, or 0.7%, to a record $1,438.
Comex March silver added 93.1 cents, or 2.6% to $37.202 an ounce, the highest finish for a nearby contract
since Feb. 12, 1980.
Worries about the shaky state of some euro-zone nations' finances also added to gold's allure.
"It would be hard to imagine a more bullish scenario for gold and silver given the real macroeconomic and
geopolitical uncertainty and risk in the world today," a note from Dublin bullion dealer GoldCore said.
Oil for May, the new front-month contract, settled 78 cents higher, or 0.7%, at $105.75 a barrel on the Nymex,
the highest settlement since September 2008.
Oil prices extended their gains after the Department of Energy reported a larger-than-expected decline in
U.S. gasoline inventories last week. Falling inventories could mean higher demand for crude oil from
refineries in the near term.
The DOE's Energy Information Administration said gasoline stocks fell 5.3 million barrels during the week
ended Friday. Analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had expected a two-million-barrel decline.
The draw marked the biggest one-week decline in gasoline inventories since September 2008, when
Hurricane Ike closed down gasoline production on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Gasoline stockpiles have fallen 21.4
million barrels over the last five weeks.

Dow Reclaims 12000 With 178-Point Jump
Monday's Markets
Dow Reclaims 12000 With 178-Point Jump

In the newly binary world of financial markets, Monday was "risk on."
Investors, emboldened by signs the worst may be over in Japan and the Middle East, snapped up riskier
assets such as stocks, commodities and the euro and shunned safe-haven investments like Treasurys.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 178.01 points, or 1.5%, to 12036.53, bringing the blue-chip index's
three-day gain to 3.6%. That winning streak is the Dow's strongest three-day run since September. The euro
rose through $1.42 to finish at its highest point in 14 months. Gold rose 0.7%.
The troubles in Japan and unrest in the Middle East and Northern Africa have seen financial markets revert to
the "risk on/risk off" mode seen through the financial crisis: Investors flee to Treasurys and safe havens in
times of stress and rush into stocks and commodities during times of optimism.
The past few days have seen investors moving further into riskier assets on hopes that Japan's nuclear crisis
may not escalate and of a quick resolution to the conflict in Libya. The gains allowed investors to claw back
some of the 6.3% slide in the Dow since Feb. 18, just before the outbreak of violence in Libya. Investors
already were beginning to read that selloff as overdone, especially Wednesday's rout that saw the Dow
plunge more than 300 points during the day.
"There are still lots of opportunities to generate hysteria in the coming days, but I think a careful analysis
shows that what's happening in Japan will be transitory," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at
Northern Trust. Still, he said, "we're going to be hostage to geopolitical markets in the short term."
Adding to the optimism was AT&T's $39 billion agreement to buy Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA unit, a
deal that would form the largest mobile-phone service provider.
To be sure, investors aren't ready to call the all-clear on the myriad challenges still facing the global economy,
from soaring oil prices, political instability across the energy-exporting Middle East, and nuclear risks after this
month's Japanese earthquake.
"It's still a news-dependent, data-dependent market," said John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global.
For oil investors, fears are increasing that a protracted engagement in Libya would keep the country's oil off
the market for months or years. Moreover, worries about potential unrest in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest
exporter, remain.
"The question is whether Saudi Arabia can keep its relative domestic tranquility," Mr. McDonald said.
But investors returned from a relatively encouraging weekend of news from Japan and the Middle East, as
well as bullish remarks by investor Warren Buffett that called the U.S. and Japanese economies strong,
saying the earthquake posed "a buying opportunity" in the world's third-largest economy.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.18 points, or 1.5%, to finish at 1298.38, while the Nasdaq
Composite surged 48.42 points, or 1.8%, to 2692.09, returning to positive territory for 2011. The markets
were led by energy stocks after crude oil rose.
The dollar slumped against most of its rivals. The U.S. Dollar Index, which weighs the greenback against a
basket of six currencies, fell to a 15-month low. The euro rose after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet indicated the bank still plans to raise interest rates next month. The Japanese yen,
which last week surged to a record, continued to weaken amid the prospect of further intervention by the
Group of Seven leading nations.

Treasurys fell broadly, pushing the yield on the 10-year note higher, to 3.319%. The Japanese stock market
was closed Monday for a holiday, but U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds dealing in Japanese stocks rose by
about 3% in heavy trading. Across the broader markets, trading volumes were relatively tepid, with 4.65
billion shares changing hands in New York Stock Exchange composite volume.
Among energy issues, drilling contractor Rowan added $2.22, or 5.5%, to $42.65; driller Noble rose 2.02, or
4.7%, to 45.35, and petroleum refiner Tesoro gained 1.01, or 4.1%, to 25.63.
Financials strengthened after the Treasury Department said it plans to start selling off the $142 billion
portfolio of agency-guaranteed, mortgage-backed securities it purchased during the financial crisis.
Hartford Financial Services Group gained 1, or 3.9%, to 26.49; American International Group rose 2.08, or
6%, to 37.03.

At the height of the housing bubble, hedge-fund manager Paul Singer was shorting subprime mortgages. By
the spring of 2007, he was warning regulators on both sides of the Atlantic that the world was facing a major
financial crisis.
They ignored him. Now the founder of Elliott Management says the biggest banks are headed for another
credit meltdown. Among the likely triggers for the next crisis, Mr. Singer sees one leading candidate:
Monetary policy "is extremely risky," he says, "the risk being massive inflation."
In some areas gas prices have reached $4 per gallon, and now Americans must brace themselves for higher
grocery bills. This week the Labor Department reported that February wholesale food prices posted their
sharpest increase since 1974. News like that has driven Mr. Singer to the history books: He treats visitors to
his 5th Avenue office to a copy of a 1931 treatise on German currency debasement, Constantino
Bresciani-Turroni's "The Economics of Inflation."
Mr. Singer -- who launched Elliott in 1977 and has delivered a 14.3% compound annual return (compared to
the S&P 500's 10.9%) -- is not comparing today's Federal Reserve to the Reichsbank of the early 1920s.
Rather, he's once again warning financial regulators. This time the message is: Don't take for granted
investor faith in a major currency.
While at Harvard Law School, Mr. Singer turned down a research job with his intellectual hero, Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, to pursue a career in finance. Today, he's still looking for heroes among the stewards of the major
currencies. Central bankers, particularly at the Fed but also in Europe, "seem to be acting as if they have
unlimited flexibility to ease monetary policy," he says.
He specifically targets the Fed's "unprecedented" policy of sustaining near-zero interest rates and its
exercise in money-printing, "Quantitative Easing 2," that has it buying medium- and longer-term securities
from the Treasury. "In effect they're treating confidence in fiat money -- in paper money -- as inexhaustible,
that it's a tool that's able to be used not just in the throes of crisis," but also as "a virtually complete substitute
for sound fiscal, regulatory and taxing policy."
Fed officials, he adds, "really seem to think that inflation is something they can deal with very easily and very
quickly. I don't believe they're right." He notes that, in the late 1970s, inflation was only in the high single
digits yet curing it required interest rates of 20% and a collapse of the bond market.
Mr. Singer further warns that investors shouldn't misinterpret apparently bullish signals from a rising market.
"Of course printing money is going to support asset prices," but "it's very dangerous" and is not a substitute
for trade, tax and regulatory reforms that make America an attractive place for job creation.
"What would a loss of confidence in the dollar actually look like? Gold going absolutely nuts," adds Mr.
Singer, who is also a major donor to conservative intellectual causes and think tanks such as the Manhattan
Institute. He observes that prices for many commodities are already near all-time highs, even with "kind of a
soft recovery" in the U.S. and Europe, and robust growth in Asia. "Imagine if hoarding, speculation,
investment positions in [hard assets] accumulate to cause commodities and gold to go rocketing up. Wages,
prices will follow," he says.
As destructive as raging inflation would be, why would it hurt the big financial institutions? It could wreak
havoc on the ability of big banks' corporate customers to make good on their obligations, Mr. Singer believes
-- and financial reform did little to reduce risks.
"Dodd-Frank has made the system more brittle and has shaped the next crisis in a very negative way," he
warns. "The opacity of financial institution financial statements has not been addressed or changed at all. . . .
We have a very large analytical research effort here and we have not found anybody that can parse" the
sensitivity of big banks to changes in interest rates, asset prices and the like. "You can't do it."

Even after the crisis, credit ratings "obviously provide no real clue," he says. "Rumor and feeling is all you
have. You don't know the financial condition of [Citigroup], JPMorgan, Bank of America, any of them." Mr.
Singer believes the big banks still carry too much leverage, and he doesn't trust regulators to monitor them
effectively.
The largest financial institutions, he says, are "a random collection of survivors. Almost none of the survivors
exist because of their perspicacity, risk controls and sound management -- even the ones that are vaunted
along those lines. . . . How and why do they exist? Mostly an accident, meaning who got bailed out first and
who was saved next and how did people feel and what did people say the weekend Merrill was under
pressure [in September 2008]."
Mr. Singer says he does as little business with big banks as possible. "Aside from a large position in Lehman
as part of our bankruptcy investing, we have no significant positions in global banks."
"We institutionally have tried to -- way before the crisis of '08 -- tried to insulate ourselves in every way we
can from the counterparty problem," i.e. getting involved in a trade with a partner that might not be able to
make good on its obligations down the line. But the nature of his business, he says, means that he can't
sever all connections. "We've removed as many assets from the Street as we possibly can, and we think
we're pretty well insulated. . . . If we could completely avoid being subject to the financial condition of any
large financial institution, we would do so."
Most investors don't share this view, of course, and big banks are still able to borrow at lower rates than their
smaller competitors. The reason, says Mr. Singer, is that right now the system "is underwritten by the United
States government and the governments of Europe. And the system is perceived as underwritten or
guaranteed." But, he warns, "at some point that guarantee, in some way that I can't really visualize today, will
go away."
Will it really? The authors of Dodd-Frank claim that the law prevents the government from bailing out any
particular firm, but the Fed can still provide emergency loans to a failing giant as long as it offers similar
financing to other firms.
"It's a very important part of this equation that a few survivors exist in this peculiar relationship with
government, having to kowtow to government, make relationships with regulators," says Mr. Singer. "Are they
puppets of the government? Are they cronies of the government? Will their lending be affected by the
perceived whims or beliefs of the particular government regulators existing at a particular time? Yes."
If the government deems a firm not "systemically important," Mr. Singer forecasts, it could spell its doom.
"Small and medium-sized financial institutions may be disadvantaged, may be sacrificed in the next crisis to
protect these behemoths," he says.
It gets even worse, Mr. Singer says, if the government ever deems a financial giant "in danger of default" -- a
judgment that can be made without the consent of the firm or its investors. The business is then taken over by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with its Orderly Liquidation Authority.
Once in charge of the firm, the government can discriminate among similarly situated creditors and transfer
assets out of the business at will. Because of this, says Mr. Singer, creditors and trading counterparties might
flee even faster than they would from a firm headed toward bankruptcy, where at least there is established
law instead of regulator discretion.
Mr. Singer's fund specializes in distressed debt and bankruptcy situations, so perhaps he has reason to
oppose changes to a system he knows so well. But he's also well-qualified to examine the government's
reforms.
"You don't know how you will be treated," he says of financial institutions under the new FDIC regime. "If
there are companies that are also counterparties alongside you but they've been designated systemically
important, that's a clue. It's like a game of treasure hunt. It's a clue that you're going to get disadvantaged
compared to them."
So maybe FDIC chairman Sheila Bair and the authors of Dodd-Frank were right about one thing: Perhaps
their new process for resolving failing giants really will discourage some people from lending to the biggest
banks -- but only at the worst possible moment.
The problem, in Mr. Singer's view, will be the jarring shift from one day being an investor in a member of the
"systemically important" club, to the next day being a creditor whose claim is determined by bureaucratic
whim. This may be welcome news to government pension funds that will want to be bailed out, but certainly
not for private investors.

The speed at which a firm will collapse as word gets around that it might be headed to FDIC resolution could
be "amazing," says Mr. Singer. And that "speed will drive the size of the losses."
This "atmosphere of unpredictability" is harmful to America's place in the financial world, he says, and "it
doesn't make the system any safer. . . . This is nuts to be identifying systemically important institutions." He
views it as a poor "substitute for creating soundness and reasonable levels of leverage throughout the
system."
Mr. Singer's views on systemic risk are particularly interesting given his prescience about subprime
mortgages (to say nothing of his ability to build a firm from zero to $17 billion in assets). In a famous 2006
presentation at a conference hosted by Grant's Interest Rate Observer, he explained in painstaking detail the
flaws in subprime-mortgage securitizations, and in the high grades awarded to them by government-anointed
credit-rating agencies. In the spring of 2007, he warned the G-7 finance ministers about the grave threat to
the banking system, but his words "fell on deaf ears," he says.
Not that Mr. Singer's analytical skills are perfect: In the aftermath of the crisis, he fingered derivatives as a
key factor, and he maintains that they will also play a role in the next crisis, even though it's now clear that in
2008 banks were felled by more conventional housing bets, not derivatives. Also, since Elliott largely doesn't
play in the derivatives market, Mr. Singer bears few of the costs if that market is regulated more heavily.
Still, Mr. Singer's testimony against Dodd-Frank and Fed monetary policy is compelling.
One reason his firm has survived for 34 years, he says, is that "we try to be very respectful of the
unpredictability of markets. We try to at all times at least assume that the world is not being properly run." A
safe assumption.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The Federal Reserve's lax monetary policy often is blamed for the rising cost of essentials like food and fuel.
But what about getting hitched? Speaking with The Wall Street Journal, Charles Jeannes, chief executive of
miner Goldcorp, recalled a recent fishing trip to the Bahamas. While there, his soon-to-marry guide
complained to him about the cost of wedding rings these days, what with gold now trading at about $1,400
an ounce, close to its all-time high.
Mr. Jeannes's guide harked back a decade, when gold was much cheaper, and he was embarking on his
previous marriage. Gold has risen more than fivefold since then, in part because of a desire by investors to
divorce themselves from the dollar and other fiat currencies. As for newlyweds, there is more incentive than
ever to make it work. Who says central banking is devoid of romance?

Investment

It's hard to beat a solid gold piece of jewelry as a gift. And if you want to escape a country in turmoil with
closed borders, a gift of a few ounces of gold will work wonders.
However, I don't believe gold holds much appeal as an investment today.
Fundamentally, the problem of gold as a portfolio investment is that it isn't a real investment. Real
investments are stocks, bonds, income-producing real estate and private businesses, all of which, except for
bonds (which produce interest instead), produce profits. These are paid out as income in the form of
dividends or are reinvested and grow.
In contrast, bullion just sits there hoping to look attractive. Since the price of gold is not supported by
anything other than the mood of investors, its value can plummet just as quickly as it soared.
The fact that is has soared of late is another negative. To me, gold has more downside than upside potential.
The metal has risen from $600 an ounce to more than $1,400 in less than five years. After the last great gold
move in the 1970s, its price declined sharply and then essentially did nothing for more than 20 years.
It's true that we have a ways to go before we reach the metal's inflation-adjusted all-time high of $2,000. But
that figure is hardly representative; it was set under a period of very high inflation, when gold more than
tripled in one year. This was followed by a dramatic drop over an extended period of time.
I know the counter-argument. "Isn't it true that gold is one of the few investments having a negative
correlation with stocks or real estate? If so, shouldn't you have some gold as a diversifier and a hedge
against a 'Black Swan' event, and establish it as a core holding in your portfolio?"
Gold does look beguiling when the world is full of fear or concerned about a coming bout of inflation. To
some, that may sound like today's difficulties. To me, that is rearview-mirror investing.
Economies are generally improving world-wide, and inflation, while of some difficulty in a few countries, is
not currently a problem in the biggest one, the U.S., nor should it become a really serious problem in the
future. No need to call in the gold troops here.
In fact, I believe U.S. stocks will do well over the next several years. In my opinion, growth in the economy
and corporate profits will exceed expectations, boosted by U.S. inventiveness and effort plus large excess
capacity in labor and plant. As a result, doesn't that augur poorly for any investment that moves in the
opposite direction of stocks?
True, the recent outbreaks in the Middle East could create economic difficulties if they were to spread to other
large oil-producing countries. But I don't think that is likely, and already Saudi Arabia has reportedly made up
for Libya's oil shortfall.
Another point about having a "core holding" of gold is that it often hides a desire for momentum investing --
latching onto a hot investment and hoping it keeps rising.
Gold momentum can reverse as quickly as the core holding in oil and commodities that was "required" when
oil was $100 to $140 per barrel. What's more, after a weak performance by gold, too many people forget the
benefits of using it for diversification, sell it and like Don Quixote climb aboard the new "heroic investment."
In my opinion, people with a strong urge to have some money in gold can keep up to 5% of their portfolio
there as a hedge if they promise to hold it rain or shine.

Since it zigs when other investments zag, it is an insurance policy. But be aware that it will lower, not raise,
your overall return in those years when you're holding it -- because, as we've seen, it doesn't produce profits
or dividends as other investments do.
Some may argue that central banks will boost demand for gold, as they use it to support the value of
currencies. But given the explosion in world financial transactions, there probably isn't enough of the metal to
do so efficiently.
Some countries may try to weaken their currencies to dilute their debt obligations and use gold to steady
their balance sheets. However, I don't believe any major nations will seriously pursue a consistent decline of
their currencies over an extended period of time.
The arguments against gold don't end there. Even some methods of buying exposure to gold can present
practical problems. True, you can buy a gold-bullion ETF and pay a relatively reasonable fee for the privilege.
But what if you want to personally hold a really meaningful sum of pure gold in, say, gold bars? Such an
investment can be a cumbersome process with a cost for safekeeping it with a third-party vendor.
Buying gold coins can be more convenient but can involve paying a markup over the asset value of the gold,
with extra liquidation costs at the time of a momentum-based sale.
As for gold-mining stocks or mutual funds owning gold stocks, they tend to see even more volatility than the
bars. There are relatively fixed costs to mine and develop the gold. Therefore, a, say, 10% move up or down
in the price of gold will have little effect on costs but a much greater impact on profits and on the share price.
There's also ethics to consider. There don't seem to be many benefits from gold production. Very little of the
production takes place in the U.S. or is owned by U.S. companies, and this doesn't help our unemployment
problem.
Finally, for all you jewelry buffs -- jewelry being gold's only major industrial use -- I have some bad news: In
the U.S., yellow gold is considered old fashioned and less popular, and it's becoming too expensive for many
buyers in poorer nations.
In sum, if I were a border guard today who received a "gift" of gold, I would cash it in and buy stocks.

Inflation Hedge

Should gold be represented in an investment portfolio? I believe it should, for a number of reasons.
In the short run, gold can be a safe haven in a time of crisis. We don't know what the next crisis will be, but
we have seen plenty of "black swan" events over the past two years alone; our markets and our world seem
increasingly hard-wired to experience periods of crisis and calm. In this sense, gold can be seen as a
short-term hedge, or a short-term speculative play on volatility.
Some may say that we're heading for a period of stability, but that's hard to believe. The Fed is desperately
trying to stimulate the economy. Housing prices remain weak. Unemployment remains high. On the political
side, the Middle East has been far from stable in recent weeks. We have learned from the past three years
that events can move extremely quickly in our increasingly interconnected world. Stability will be more and
more fleeting -- perhaps permanently.
In the longer term, gold is a good way to invest in expectation of higher inflation -- a growing possibility. As
governments battle debt problems and central banks intervene on their behalf, we could very well see
deliberate weakening of currencies in many developed countries. Why use gold, rather than some other
inflation hedge? Simplicity. Gold can be easily held in most portfolios, particularly with the advent of
gold-bullion ETFs.
Another consideration for the long term is that gold may partially regain its status as a reserve currency.
Individual investors hedging against inflation with gold is one thing, but central banks doing the same is
another matter entirely.
If central banks start buying gold in earnest, it will create extra demand. Even if central banks simply hold
onto their stockpiles of the metal, they will limit supply. Either scenario gives some support to the gold price.
The reasons for owning gold are not all pessimistic, however. Unprecedented numbers of people are
entering the middle class across the globe. As these newly minted members of the middle class continue to
save, they will continue to be a growing source of demand for gold -- even if gold jewelry starts losing its
luster in the U.S. This is actually the reason I started investing in gold for clients back in 2003.
Some may not agree philosophically with the value we place on gold, a metal with few industrial applications
that produces no income. But, like anything, its price is determined by supply and demand. Supply has
always been limited, and demand has always been high.
Throughout history, gold has been valuable to humans of all cultures. Consider how the Spanish
conquistadors encountered cultures that also treasured gold. These were two independent civilizations, on
what then were completely opposite ends of the Earth, yet both valued this same shiny yellow metal.
In other words, gold was treasured long before the invention of stocks, bonds, fiat currencies, credit default
swaps, collateralized debt obligations and the like. When part of a portfolio of income-producing assets, gold
gives some protection against that income being eroded by inflation.
Naysayers raise questions about the ethics of owning gold, but debating the ethics of one type of economic
activity over another will rarely yield satisfactory answers for everyone. Is mining exploitative to the people in
the mines? To the environment? Does it bring prosperity to the producing countries? Or does it foster
corruption and poorly diversified economies? These questions have been asked about nearly every product
imported into the U.S. If we set our sights on gold for this scrutiny, we should do the same for other products.
To be sure, gold comes with caveats, and investors should incorporate it into their portfolios only with an
understanding of the risks. It can be volatile, for one thing, and prices certainly look more frothy than they did
a decade ago.

--- Page 68 ---

But they're far from bubble territory. Gold, which is currently above $1,400 an ounce, would need to top
$2,000 to match its all-time high, adjusted for inflation. Indeed, gold is still something of a contrarian
investment. Ten years ago, gold was almost universally hated as an investment. I know firsthand because
people thought I was crazy for buying it. Today, gold is still eyed with suspicion by most.
For instance, the GLD exchange-traded fund holds over $53 billion in its vaults; that may sound like a lot, but
it is less than 0.1% of the financial assets owned by households and non-financial businesses in the U.S.
It's also true that you may pay a markup for buying gold; the cost of buying a security should be factored in
any investment decision. However, there are plenty of popular vehicles that, in my view, charge reasonable
prices for exposure to gold: GLD, for instance, costs 40 basis points annually.
Another complaint is that some ways of buying gold come with extra risks. I agree that investors should take
those risks into consideration. Gold-mining shares, for one, are definitely more volatile and can be correlated
with the stock market especially in sharp declines -- so buyer beware.
As for the argument that gold will make lower returns than an investment with dividends and interest -- that's
simply not knowable. If we look at the past 11 years, the S&P 500, which has dividends, has delivered no
returns.
I do not advocate an enormous percentage allocation to gold, but I do think a responsible investor should
allocate at least a portion of the portfolio (5% to 10%) to the metal.
In the near term, it offers some protection from the next "Black Swan" event. More long term, it offers a hedge
against the threat of inflation. In the meantime, it offers a unique way to invest in the prosperity spreading to
the billions who inhabit South and East Asia. These reasons are every bit as applicable now as they were 10
years ago, when gold was worth a quarter of what it is today.

Tactics

Q:With oil prices soaring and prices of food and other items rising, how can an investor protect against
inflation?
A:Investors in the past often turned to gold and other precious metals when looking to bet on, or find
protection from, inflation. But some analysts say that because these investments have jumped in price in
recent years, their current levels already assume a surge in inflation, at least down the road. Other
commodity-related investments also are expensive, making them dangerous inflation plays.
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, are another standard anti-inflation strategy. These bonds
are designed to provide a return indexed to inflation. But investors already have flooded into TIPS, too,
driving prices up and inflation-adjusted yields down. Ten-year TIPS yield just over 1% after inflation is taken
into consideration, compared with an average of 2% in recent years.
As an alternative, Marilyn Cohen, president of Envision Capital in Los Angeles, recommends Corporate
Inflation Protected Securities. The corporate twin of TIPS, CIPS are private-sector bonds that come with a
specific interest rate adjusted periodically for inflation. They're better than TIPS, Ms. Cohen says, because
they carry a higher yield. And they pay income monthly based on the consumer price index, or CPI, another
advantage over TIPS.
"TIPS make you wait until maturity, or when sold, to capture the adjusted principal," Ms. Cohen notes.
She recommends two CIPS: from Citigroup unit Citigroup Funding Inc., maturing March 24, 2021, currently
yielding 5% for the next 12 months; and from SLM Corp., the student-loan backer commonly known as Sallie
Mae, maturing May 3, 2019, and yielding 3.75%.
The catch with CIPS: These bonds are not issued in large volume, so they can be harder to buy and sell
without moving prices. Another problem is that some say CPI understates actual inflation rates, reducing the
return on these investments.
Bolder investors might consider an exchange-traded fund that rises in value as Treasurys fall in price,
something that could happen if inflation perks up. One example: US ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year
Treasury, a fund that buys derivative investments in the hope of achieving a return that's twice the inverse
performance of Barclays Capital's benchmark index of 20-year Treasurys. Another: Rydex Juno fund, which
profits when yields on the 30-year Treasury bond rise. The IndexIQ CPI Inflation Hedged ETF also tries to
hedge against inflation.
Bill Gross, founder of Pacific Investment Management Co., advises shying away from Treasury bonds and
focusing on debt of emerging-market nations. Morgan Stanley notes that municipal bonds tend to do well
when inflation picks up.
Farmland also does well during inflation, increasing the attraction of ETFs and exchange-traded notes that
track returns of agriculture and livestock, like MOO, the trading symbol for Market Vectors-Agribusiness,
COW, for iPath DJ-UBS Livestock TR Sub Index ETN, and PowerShares DB Agriculture.
A word of caution: Some dismiss recent price rises as a blip. Indeed, just a few months ago investors were
fretting about deflation, not inflation. New price pressures could put a crimp on the economy, leading to
lower inflation, these skeptics say.
Also, sustained inflation tends to occur when wages improve, something that we have yet to see. If
unemployment continues to fall, wages could firm, creating new potential inflationary pressures.

Q:What's the best gold investment from a tax perspective?
A:Investors and experts disagree on the best ways to profit from rising gold prices. Some like shares of
miners or gold ETFs; others favor options, futures or coins.
Few consider the tax implications of these decisions, however. Gold is considered a "collectible" by the
Internal Revenue Service when held as coins or bullion. As such, taxes on long-term gains are 28%,
compared with 15% on long-term stock gains.
Even gold ETFs, like SPDR Gold Shares, are taxed at the higher level because they're considered "grantor
trusts," not mutual funds, notes Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York brokerage
firm. Long-term rates on these ETFs, or rates for investments held longer than a year, are 28%. Short-term
rates are at ordinary income rates, just as with stocks.
Mr. Gordon favors gold options or futures contracts, which are taxed at a blended rate of 23%, no matter how
long you hold them. He and other advisers say it's folly to base an investment decision on its tax treatment,
however. A gold ETF might have upside that offsets its higher tax treatment.
Options on many gold ETFs are actively traded and easy to buy and exit, making them a better choice for
many investors, argues Mr. Gordon. At the same time, an investor who has purchased an option on a gold
ETF doesn't have to fork over more money to a broker if the investment falls in price, as with a futures
contracts that turns sour.
"The instrument an investor uses can add an awful lot on after-tax basis," Mr. Gordon says.

World markets mostly slumped Monday as rising oil prices fueled fears about inflation and economic growth.
Japanese and Indian stocks faced added pressure from political setbacks to the ruling governments, and
European stocks reversed early gains as U.S. markets turned negative.
Japan's Nikkei Stock Average tumbled 1.8% to 10505.02. South Korea's Kospi continued to spiral lower,
shedding 1.2% to 1980.27. It has fallen in 14 of the past 19 trading sessions.
Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.4% to 4797.88, the ninth decline in the past 12 sessions. Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index shed 0.4% to 23313.19. Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.8% to 8713.79.
India's Sensex fell 1.4% to 18222.67; it is down 11% in 2011.
In SHANGHAI, Chinese shares rose on the back of supportive economic policies, sending the benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index up 1.8% to a fresh 2011 closing high of 2996.21.
With crude-oil prices briefly piercing $106 a barrel, energy shares outperformed stock benchmarks. Cnooc
rose 1.9%.
Coal miners rose sharply on hopes prices will ride higher in tandem with oil prices. At the same time, a flight
to safety pushed gold prices to an all-time high of $1445.05 intraday, although prices later retreated.
China Shenhua Energy and China Coal Energy jumped by the 10% daily limit in Shanghai; among gold
miners, Zijin Mining Group and Shandong Gold-Mining rose 2% and 2.2%, respectively.
In SYDNEY, other sectors retreated, with airlines among the worst hit. Virgin Blue Holdings shed 4.1%.
In TOKYO, the declines were aggravated by political turmoil, with Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara -- one of the
country's more popular politicians -- resigning Sunday over illegal political donations from a foreign national.
"There is caution over the risk of a [further] downgrade in Japan's sovereign-debt rating if political uncertainty
deepens," said Hisatsune Kobayashi, a senior market analyst at Nikko Cordial Securities.
Exporters were hit especially hard. Canon slid 2.4%, Honda Motor fell 3.1%, and Nissan Motor shed 2.6%.
In MUMBAI, shares tumbled after weekend media reports said the Dravida Munnettra Kazhagam -- an ally of
the federal government formed by a multi-party coalition -- had withdrawn its support.
HDFC Bank fell 2%, Reliance Communications shed 3.6%, and Tata Motors declined 4.1%.
In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 index closed down 0.4% at 280.72.
The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index fell 0.3% to 5973.78, France's CAC-40 index ended down 0.7% at 3990.41 and
Germany's DAX dropped 0.2% to 7161.93.
In PARIS, the luxury-goods sector got a boost from merger activity, after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
announced a 4.3 billion euro deal to take control of Italy's Bulgari, which represents a premium of about 61%
for the company. LVMH gained 1.3% and Bulgari surged 59%.
In LONDON, Inmarsat fell more than 13% after the satellite-network operator's results included a cautious
forecast.
In FRANKFURT, Salzgitter fell 1.6% after the steelmaker reported a 2010 profit that fell short of market
expectations.

Shares across the Americas largely declined , too.
In TORONTO, the S&P/TSX lost 1.1% to 14092.35.
Early Tuesday in Asia
Asian markets were mixed in early trading, with mergers and acquisition activity helping support Tokyo
shares. Japan was up 0.3% and South Korea added 0.2%; Australia was down 0.1% and New Zealand
slipped 0.3%.

Despite a more optimistic economic outlook and a stronger stock market, investors can't afford to sit back and
relax, says Richard Smith, a financial adviser from Richmond, Va.
"Investors really need to be more prepared for a higher frequency of financial shocks than we have seen in
the past," says Mr. Smith, president of Capital Advisory Group LLC, which manages $1.1 billion in assets.
While the U.S. and several foreign governments have taken a variety of steps to revive their economies,
including flooding them with money, it isn't clear what will happen when that money is withdrawn, says Mr.
Smith.
He also says financial markets have become highly correlated in recent years, meaning a problem in any part
of the world can hurt markets everywhere. "Nobody is insulated from these financial shocks no matter where
they resonate," says Mr. Smith. "We can't let our guard down."
In an attempt to shield his clients from these uncertainties, Mr. Smith invests a portion of their money with
fund managers who have the flexibility to buy various types of investments, from stocks and bonds to gold
and cash. He believes these managers can provide returns in both good and bad markets because they can
move from one investment to another, depending on what's happening in the markets.
"We are in an environment where [flexible] managers can prosper," says Mr. Smith. He says the model of
"buy, hold and pray" has become "an anachronism."
In this column, we feature model portfolios from prominent financial advisers who invest in mutual funds and
exchange-traded funds. Mr. Smith, 64 years old, founded Capital Advisory Group in 1983. For the firm's
institutional and very wealthy clients, Mr. Smith uses some privately managed accounts, which are portfolios
of stocks, bonds and other investments tailored to investors' needs. For individual clients with less than
$500,000 in assets, Mr. Smith primarily uses funds and ETFs.
Some of the funds Mr. Smith uses aim to make money even in declining markets. They include an "absolute
return" fund and a "managed futures" fund, which invests in derivatives of commodities and currencies,
among other assets.
Mr. Smith emphasizes appropriate tax management, which he says can add 0.5% to 1% annually to
investors' returns over a 10-year period. One key measure he uses is tax-loss harvesting, in which investors
sell a losing investment to book losses and reinvest that money in a similar fund to continue getting their
market exposure. The losses can offset gains in other investments that would otherwise be subject to income
tax.
In comparison, attempts to get the right asset allocation and the right mix of money managers add much less
value to portfolio returns, he says.
Here Mr. Smith shares a balanced model portfolio meant for clients with less than $500,000 in assets who
have a moderate risk appetite and an investment horizon of 10 years. The portfolio gained 13% in 2010 and
around 4.3% annualized over the five years through Dec. 31, 2010, before deduction of the firm's advisory
fees, which range from 1.25% to 0.2% annually, depending on portfolio size.
U.S. STOCKS: The portfolio has a 36% allocation to U.S. shares, mostly through funds in which managers
bet on stocks they believe will beat a benchmark index. While academic literature often extols funds that
simply provide the return of an index, Mr. Smith says such research is aimed at individual investors who don't
have professional help. "For that audience, they're absolutely right," he says. "The key is to be able to discern
[manager] skill."

--- Page 74 ---
Page 74 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Still, index-tracking funds have a place in his portfolios. He allocates 9% to one index fund -- Schwab U.S.
Large-Cap ETF, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index made up of around
750 stocks.
The firm has 12% of the portfolio in Prudential Jennison Equity Opportunity. The fund's managers can invest
in stocks of any size, making it a "nice fit into our equity module," says Nick Zizzo, managing director,
investment advisory services, at Capital Advisory Group.
Ten percent goes to JPMorgan U.S. Large Cap Core Plus, which aims to make money in part by betting
against stocks that are losing value. The portfolio's small-company allocation is in Touchstone Small Cap
Core, at 5%.
When selecting funds, Mr. Zizzo says, his firm looks "for a combination of managers that can capture or
outperform the benchmark in good periods . . . or mitigate downside risk in bad markets."
FOREIGN STOCKS: These get a 9% allocation through three funds.
Manning & Napier World Opportunities, at 4%, and Harbor International, at 3%, primarily buy stocks of foreign
developed countries. However, the Manning & Napier fund has a third of its portfolio in medium-size foreign
companies, while Harbor's investments are almost entirely in large-company stocks. "They're very
complementary to each other," says Mr. Zizzo.
For exposure to developing-country stocks, the firm allocates 2% to Eaton Vance Parametric Structured
Emerging Markets.
BONDS: The firm believes that the fixed-income market is risky right now, because there is a good chance
the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates to curb potential inflation. Bond prices fall when interest rates
rise.
Instead of making bets about which bonds will do well in this market environment, "we want a highly skilled
multisector manager helping to manage that risk," says Mr. Smith.
So, the majority of the 25% bond allocation in the portfolio goes to funds that give managers flexibility to buy
different types of bonds, including low-quality bonds and foreign bonds.
The advisers allocate 5% to Pimco Unconstrained Bond, which can hold bonds of any duration and invest up
to 50% of its portfolio in emerging markets. Ten percent goes to another multisector fund, Loomis Sayles
Bond, which currently has a third of its portfolio in low-quality or unrated bonds. This fund has "higher risk and
a higher expected return," says Mr. Smith.
There is a 5% allocation to both Pimco Total Return, which typically holds medium-term U.S. bonds, and
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index, which buys high-quality U.S. corporate and government bonds.
ALTERNATIVES: There is a 30% allocation to funds that can either invest in various asset classes or that aim
to make money even in declining markets. Before 2008, just 10% of the portfolio was devoted to these types
of investments.
Mr. Smith expects the six funds the advisers use to provide returns "somewhere between stocks and bonds"
but with less correlation to the stock and bond markets.
The advisers allocate 5% each to Pimco All Asset All Authority and IVA Worldwide, both of which can invest
in stocks, bonds or commodities and can also hold large amounts of cash if the managers wish. Ten percent
is in RiverFront Moderate Growth & Income, a balanced fund that holds foreign bonds and master limited
partnerships, among other investments.
These three funds use different processes, "so their portfolios don't look the same at any point in time," says
Mr. Smith.
Other funds in the portfolio are meant to reduce risk.
MutualHedge Frontier Legends, at 4%, aims to make money in both rising and falling markets with lower
volatility than the broad stock market, according to its prospectus. The fund follows a managed-futures
strategy, investing in derivatives and fixed-income securities tied to currencies, interest rates, stock indexes
and energy resources, among other investments. The portfolio also allocates 3% each to Absolute
Opportunities and TFS Market Neutral.
During the market downturn in 2008, some investors were disillusioned by the performance of such
absolute-return and market-neutral funds. Mr. Smith, however, stands by them. He says some of these funds

lost less than the average stock fund, and thus were relatively better. "What people expected was they
wouldn't drop at all," he says.

Blue Chips Fall 88.32 With Oil Over $104

A volatile week for the U.S. stock market ended with another jolt.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 178.69 points during the day before staging a sharp
rally in the last half hour of trading. The Dow ended the day down 88.32 points, or 0.72%, to finish at
12169.88, just higher than where it started the week.
Throughout the week, intermittent worries about Middle East tensions and surging oil prices sent the
blue-chip index swinging between triple-digit gains and losses.
"When volatility increases and you get that down-up, down-up movement, that means the market is very
undecided -- one day the bulls are in command, the next day it's the bears," said Jeffrey Friedman, senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. He pointed to continuing concerns of an oil disruption in the
Middle East, as well as a package of encouraging indicators on hiring, manufacturing and the services sector,
that were sending conflicting signals to the market.
Friday saw the stock market open sharply lower after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 192,000 new
jobs were added in February, disappointing investors who had hoped for more. As well, surging crude-oil
prices raised anew the specter of inflation and slower economic growth, weighing on the market.
Crude oil rose $2.51 to settle at $104.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since
late September 2008. After hours, crude rose to almost $105 a barrel.
The surge in crude was spurred by reports of fresh violence in Libya, a major oil-exporting nation, including
intense skirmishes near the country's centers of oil production. Reports of escalating tensions in Bahrain and
Yemen also increased investors' concerns.
"I don't think anyone wants to be long stocks going into the weekend," Mr. Friedman said. While there was a
good chance the weekend passes uneventfully, "I'm not going to chance it."
Investors sought the safety of Treasurys while pushing gold back up to just shy of its record. The euro also
rose, piercing through $1.40 for the first time since November, as investors digested the prospects of a rate
increase in Europe.
The S&P 500-stock index dropped 9.82 points, or 0.74%, to end at 1321.15, eking out a slight gain for the
week. Financial stocks weighed most heavily. Banks fell sharply on Friday, weighed down by Citigroup and
Goldman Sachs Group after Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analysts cut their ratings on the companies to
"neutral" from "buy," citing expected weakness in first-quarter results.
Citigroup slipped 14 cents, or 3%, to $4.54, and Goldman shed 3.49, or 2.1%, to 161.00.
Even with the day's selloff, some market watchers see the recent two-week stumble as only a temporary
setback in the larger bull run that began last September.
"People are still underinvested," said Timothy McCandless, senior equity analyst for Bel Air Investment
Advisors. Despite continuing concerns about high oil costs, he believed the ongoing support of the Federal
Reserve's asset purchases means that investors will continue to push up stock prices.
Among stocks, Marvell Technology slid 2.09, or 11%, to 16.13. The chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings rose 8.8% but came in at the low end of the company's projections, and it forecast disappointing
first-quarter results on weakness in the mobile and wireless markets.

Research In Motion dropped 1.98, or 2.9%, to 66.47 after its chief marketing officer resigned, citing "personal
reasons."
Among Dow components, General Electric fell 38 cents, or 1.8%, to 20.37, Hewlett-Packardshed 59 cents, or
1.4%, to 42.61, and American Express declined 58 cents, or 1.3%, to 43.72.
New York Times shares fell 62 cents, or 5.7%, to $10.24 after Lazard Capital Markets analysts rated the
stock "sell" and set a $7 price target. The analysts said the company faces new advertising-revenue
pressures due to digital competition.
Casino operator Pinnacle Entertainment shed 56 cents, or 4.3%, to 12.51 after disclosing Chief Financial
Officer Stephen H. Capp has decided to leave the company, effective March 31. Pinnacle said it expects to
appoint a successor by that time.
USA Mobility slid 86 cents, or 4.3%, to 13.43. The wireless-messaging and communications-services provider
said it is acquiring communications company Amcom Software from Norwest Equity Partners for $163.3
million. USA Mobility said it plans to repay debt tied to the acquisition over the next two years.
Vivus shares fell 66 cents, or 9.4%, to 6.39. The Food and Drug Administration warned of birth-defect risks
from antiseizure and migraine drug topiramate, which is a component of Vivus weight-loss drug Qnexa.
Orbital Sciences shed 30 cents, or 1.6%, to 18.17. The space-technology company said the launch of its
Taurus XL rocket, carrying a company-built Glory satellite for NASA, was unsuccessful.
Madison Square Garden slipped 1.61, or 5.4%, to 28.10 as the company said the costs of renovating its
namesake arena could be higher than previously expected. Fourth-quarter profit jumped 40% but missed
Wall Street expectations slightly.
Auto-service company Midas jumped 1, or 12%, to 9.20. Midas said a Geneva arbitration tribunal ruled in its
favor on the "vast majority" of claims in a contract dispute with European licensee Mesa SpA, though some
damages will add charges to the fourth quarter, it added.

Equities Escape
The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its best single-day gain this year on Thursday. That day's 1.6%
rally, the largest since Dec. 1, erased Tuesday's 1.4% loss. The Dow then trimmed a triple-digit drop on
Friday to finish the week up 0.3% at 12169.88.
Gold and Silver Shine
Gold closed at a new all-time high of $1,428 an ounce on Wednesday, as further turmoil in the Middle East
and Africa sent oil above $100 and gasoline prices to $3.47 a gallon -- furthering fears of inflation. Silver
closed at $35.32 an ounce on Friday, its highest in 31 years.
Polish That Resume
Private employers added 222,000 jobs in February, the most since April 2010. Unemployment fell to 8.9% in
January, the lowest since April 2009. And the number of unemployment claims stayed below 400,000 for two
consecutive weeks for the first time since July 2008.

Euro Pierces $1.40 On Rate Speculation

NEW YORK -- The euro briefly rose above $1.40 for the first time since November on Friday, as investors
reacted to a mildly disappointing U.S. nonfarm-payrolls report and continued to bet on expectations of
euro-zone rate increases.
More upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East, meanwhile, pushed up oil prices and sent investors
scrambling into the Swiss franc, gold and other safe-haven assets.
But widening interest-rate differentials reigned as the main market driver, as investors expect the European
Central Bank to raise interest rates possibly as soon as April, while the Federal Reserve is expected to hold
onto its loose monetary policy much longer.
"The game in town now is to second-guess which is the next major central bank to acknowledge rising
inflationary pressures and respond by raising interest rates," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency
strategist with Bank of New York Mellon.
Investors continued to digest ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's surprisingly hawkish tone from his
appearance after Thursday's rate-setting meeting, and, as a result, the prospect for higher rates in Europe
trumped the U.S. jobs report.
Overall, new data indicated that the U.S. jobs market rebounded in February and unemployment fell below
9% for the first time in nearly two years, the latest signs of a steadily improving economy. But nonfarm
payrolls rose by 192,000 last month, below the forecast consensus of 200,000, causing some market
disappointment.
The report failed to give the dollar a much-needed rebound, and instead the euro shot up to a four-month
high against the greenback.
"If it's a race between the ECB is going to hike rates . . . and a two-tenths decline in the U.S. unemployment
rate, the ECB won," said Jeffrey Young, head of North American FX research at Barclays Capital.
Many investors were taking long positions on the euro ahead of the weekend, analysts said.
Late Friday, the euro was at $1.3986 from $1.3960 late Thursday. The dollar traded at 82.32 yen from 82.36
yen, while the euro bought 115.13 yen from 114.97 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.6271 from $1.6269. The
dollar fetched 0.9259 Swiss franc from 0.9319 franc.
The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. dollar against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, was at
76.41 from 76.483.
Ongoing turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East also weighed on riskier
currencies. Media reports of fighting near Libya's oil facilities pushed oil prices higher, and the news buoyed
safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc, which gained broadly against its rivals, including the dollar.
The Swiss franc has emerged "as the ultimate safe haven over either euro or dollar," said Greg Anderson,
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Citigroup.
In addition, market expectations that the Swiss National Bank also could be closer to raising rates helped
buoy the Swiss franc, said Steven Barrow, a strategist with Standard Bank in London.
Elsewhere, the New Zealand dollar suffered on the prospect that the Royal Bank of New Zealand could cut
interest rates at its next meeting. The New Zealand dollar hit a five-month low against the U.S. dollar on
Friday.

With crude-oil prices cracking $100 a barrel and $1.4 billion in new money gushing into energy funds in the
week ended Wednesday, should you be pumping oil stocks into your portfolio, too?
It may seem obvious that you should buy energy stocks since the price of oil is bound to go higher. Precisely
because it seems obvious, you should doubt that belief. Adjusted for the overall rate of inflation, the price of
oil has tended to go down, not up.
All the way from the Civil War (when a barrel of oil cost roughly $168 in today's money) to the early 1970s,
the oil price, adjusted for inflation, sloped jaggedly downward. Since then, it has lurched up and down and
up again in response to events, such as the wave of revolutions sweeping across North Africa, that investors
believe will affect supply or demand.
After the recent run-up, oil is down more than 25% from its price in mid-2008. Adjusted for inflation, the price
of oil today is just 4% higher than it was at its last peak in January 1981, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration. There were many sickening bumps throughout the intervening 30 years, but in the
end the average annual gain, adjusted for inflation, was roughly 0.014% -- a return that makes a
money-market fund look like a gusher.
Even from early 1973, before oil prices tripled, the long-run real return is less than 4.5%, according to analyst
Howard Simons of Bianco Research. That is less than the return on cash after inflation.
When prices have spiked, it has usually been because of supply fears -- as in Iraq and Iran during their war in
1980-81, Kuwait in 1990 and Venezuela and Iraq in 2003. But supply shortages tend to be solved quickly.
Over time, rising prices have consistently brought on rising production, which has tended to lead to falling
prices.
Douglas Ober, who runs the oldest fund specializing in energy stocks -- Petroleum & Resources Corp., which
was founded in 1929 -- isn't a long-term bull. "As long as there is unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,
we're going to have higher oil prices," says Mr. Ober, who has managed the fund since 1986. "But once it
settles down over there, oil prices will probably come back down. There's a fair amount of speculation in the
price."
Chances are, you already own plenty of oil-related stocks. Energy companies account for 13% of the total
market value of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
That may not sound like much -- financial stocks make up 16%, and technology 19% -- but energy's weighting
in the index has more than doubled in the past decade and has rarely been higher. Similar rises in the
weightings of tech stocks in the 1990s and financials a few years ago were followed by steep declines in
those stocks.
And the price of oil may matter less to stock investors than it used to. Nowadays, the stock market is
dominated by technology, financial and health-care companies; their profits aren't pounded nearly as hard by
rising oil prices as are those of the oil-guzzling industrial firms that used to drive the U.S. economy.
Over the past decade, stock prices have been about half as sensitive to sharp moves in oil prices over the
past decade as they were over the previous 10 years, estimates Sridhar Gogineni, a finance professor at the
University of Oklahoma. In recent years, a 5% rise in oil prices has knocked an average of just 0.12% off
stock returns. This year, oil is up better than 12% -- and stocks have shrugged that off, rising 5%.
There's an argument to be made that one way to offset higher energy prices is to buy energy stocks. That
way, your gains on the stocks will mitigate the rising costs of gasoline, heating oil and electricity. And if your
company's profits will be hurt by rising oil prices, owning energy stocks could cushion a salary cut or, even
worse, the loss of your job.

But this hedge is no slam dunk. Most firms whose profits are vulnerable to higher oil prices, like airlines,
truckers and chemical producers, use the commodities market to hedge away their exposure. So, if your
company hedges against oil prices, you probably don't have to, says Francis Kinniry, an investment strategist
at Vanguard Group. (The footnotes to the company's annual report should indicate whether it hedges oil
prices.)
It could be prudent to invest more in energy stocks if you are a retiree with a fixed income and a high
home-heating bill or if you are self-employed and particularly vulnerable to a jump in gasoline prices. For
most investors, however, there isn't a need to join the black-gold rush.

Dow Rise Is Biggest In Three Months
Thursday's Markets
Dow Rise Is Biggest In Three Months

Stock-market bulls barreled through fears of $100 oil, seizing instead on encouraging employment and
service-sector numbers to push the market to its biggest one-day gain in three months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 191.40 points, or 1.59%, to 12258.20. Investors sold off gold for
the first session in four, and Treasurys fell, lifting yields to a two-week high. Yields rise when prices fall.
The stock gains helped the Dow recover some of the losses incurred last week, when the blue-chip index
dropped more than 260 points, its worst week since August.
That drop was driven by worries that tensions in Libya, Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arab world would
push oil prices higher, fueling inflation and squelching the U.S. economic recovery. It also coincided with a
consensus among investors that the market was due for a pullback after the powerful stock rally since late
August.
But many investors are starting to believe the U.S. economic recovery is resilient enough to withstand
triple-digit oil prices, especially with the Federal Reserve still propping up the economy. Crude oil edged 0.3%
lower to $101.91 a barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading on Thursday, after jumping from less than
$90 just two weeks ago.
Thursday, the gains were specifically fueled by a government report showing jobless claims fell to their lowest
level since May 2008. February retail sales and a reading of the U.S. service sector also beat expectations.
"The economic data has been incredibly positive, and it's clear the U.S. economy has enough positive
momentum to absorb a mild oil shock," said Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist for UBS Wealth Management
Research.
The euro also posted robust gains after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet strongly
hinted the central bank may raise interest rates for the first time since 2008. The euro ended at $1.3960, its
highest level since early November, while European stocks hung onto their day's gains.
While oil and geopolitical uncertainties have thrown the market off balance in recent weeks, crude oil is about
27% higher than a year ago -- not an alarming gain, according to Gina Martin Adams, director of equity
research at Wells Fargo Securities. History shows a 50% year-on-year rise in oil prices (to about $120) starts
to hit corporate earnings broadly, she said, while an 80% rise (to about $150) has historically led to a
recession.
"The struggle for investors is, 'How will we know when fuel costs begin to hit economic activity?'" said Myles
Zyblock, chief institutional strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "What the leading economic
indicators we have now are telling us is that corporate earnings should hang in there. . . . We had a repricing
after worries about Libya, and that spooked the market, but it's not yet in the data."
Industrial and financial stocks led Thursday's charge, with Caterpillar and Bank of America adding 3.2% each.
The S&P 500-stock index gained 22.53 points, or 1.72%, to 1330.97, while the Nasdaq Composite gained
50.67 points, or 1.84%, to 2798.74.
After Thursday's jobs data, investors will be looking for confirmation of the improving labor picture when the
Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday reports monthly payrolls information.
In the meantime, the economy's manufacturing and service sectors continue to generate robust numbers,
adding hope that productivity gains can offset rising commodity prices and, thus, protect companies' bottom
lines.

Page 86 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
The rally's surprising strength in recent months has been bolstered by a consistent inflow of retail-investor
money into domestic stocks, as well as by the Fed's continued asset purchases, which have flooded the
market with money and pushed investors into riskier assets.
"As long as the Fed is behind this market, there's got to be a positive bias, if only because of all the liquidity,"
said Ms. Adams of Wells Fargo. "It's hard to argue against risky assets." She says that the past two weeks of
volatility and declines have shaken a lot of irrational optimism out of the stock market.
Among stocks, Amylin Pharmaceuticals slid $3.81, or 25%, to $11.20, and Alkermes fell 1.54, or 11%, to
12.56 after an investigational drug to treat Type 2 diabetes failed to meet primary endpoints in a 26-week
study.
Saks gained 45 cents, or 3.8%, to 12.18, and Nordstrom rose 41 cents, or 0.9%, to 44.62, as sales topped
analysts' expectations.
US Airways Group added 39 cents, or 4.9%, to 8.36 after the carrier said traffic rose 4.5% in February from a
year earlier.

Libyan Fighting Spurs Oil, Gold --- Crude Crosses $100 Mark; Precious Metal at All-Time High

Libyan Fighting Spurs Oil, Gold --- Crude Crosses $100 Mark; Precious Metal at All-Time High

NEW YORK -- Crude futures settled above $100 a barrel for the first time in more than two years, and gold
hit an all-time high, as heavy fighting in Libya spurred worries about oil supplies and inflation.
Markets fixated on news reports that forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi launched an offensive in
the oil-rich eastern part of the country but met heavy resistance from rebel soldiers. The oil-refinery city of
Brega was a site of much of the fighting, according to the reports.
Light, sweet crude for April delivery settled up $2.60, or 2.6%, at $102.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the highest settlement since Sept. 26, 2008. Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange settled up
93 cents, or 0.8%, at $116.35 a barrel, its highest settlement since Aug. 21, 2008.
"The military activity going on is causing this market to erupt," said Tony Rosado, broker at GA Global
Markets in New York.
Many traders are fearful the unrest that has swept the Middle East and North Africa in recent months will lead
to additional violence and disruptions to crude supplies in other countries.
Adding to those fears, the International Energy Agency said the conflict in Libya has caused more oil
production to be shuttered than initially forecast. Between 850,000 and one million barrels a day of Libyan
crude output has gone offline, the watchdog said. Last week, the IEA said between 500,000 and 750,000
barrels a day of Libyan crude-oil production had been disrupted.
Still, the IEA said European refiners -- the main recipients of Libyan oil -- have "ample crude" in supply until
"at least the end of March."
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said total crude-oil production last month was little
changed from January, suggesting production increases from Gulf countries have offset lost production from
Libya.
Nervous investors continued to seek safety in gold. The March gold contract ended up $6.50, or 0.5%, at
$1,437.20 a troy ounce, a new high.
"Rather than running to anything else, particularly the dollar, people seem to be still flocking to gold," said
Dan Cook, chief executive of brokerage IG Markets Inc.
In addition to maintaining its value in times of uncertainty, gold is used as a hedge against inflation. Higher
oil prices, combined with ultralow U.S. interest rates and the Federal Reserve's purchase of Treasurys to
stimulate the economy, have caused concern about inflation in the long term.
Richard Davis, managing director and portfolio manager in BlackRock's natural-resources equity division,
said that while the price of gold has reached a high on political unrest in the Middle East, factors such as
concern about the global recovery, currency volatility and the increasing pricing power and size of the
emerging-market consumer will keep investors interested in gold over the medium term.

Corrections & Amplifications
The 30-year bond rose 2/32 to yield 4.489% on Tuesday. A Credit Markets article on Wednesday incorrectly
said the yield was 3.489%.
(WSJ March 5, 2011)
(END)
NEW YORK -- Treasurys mostly rose Tuesday as worries over the political turmoil in the Middle East
overrode robust manufacturing data from the U.S. and the euro zone.
An extra support came from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who reiterated his views Tuesday
that the central bank will continue its monetary stimulus for the economy, citing a still-weak labor market and
contained inflation expectations.
"Talk of unrest growing in Iran is pushing oil higher and adding to the flight to quality in Treasurys," said Guy
LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which manages $12
billion in fixed-income assets. "The Bernanke testimony didn't contain any of the 'tape bombs' that some
Treasury bears were concerned about."
Short-dated notes led the rebound as many investors sold stocks and parked cash in Treasurys and gold.
Late afternoon, the two-year note was 2/32 higher to yield 0.672%. The benchmark 10-year note recouped
earlier losses to end flat to yield 3.416%. The 30-year bond was 2/32 higher to yield 3.489%. Bond yields
move inversely to their prices.
Anxiety about potential disruption of global oil supply had risen in recent weeks that had sent crude-oil prices
soaring. Some investors were worried that the political unrest roiling countries such as Libya and Egypt may
spread to bigger oil producers such as Saudi Arabia.
"The economic data have been brighter yet the recovery remains tenuous," said Tom Tucci, head of U.S.
government bond trading in New York at RBC Capital Markets LLC. "The economy still faces risk of oil shock,
equity shock and housing market shock."
With the bond market sandwiched between robust economic data and geopolitical risk, Mr. Tucci said, the
10-year note's yield is likely to be capped between 3.4% and 3.6% ahead of Friday's non-farm payrolls report.
The 10-year note's yield has dropped from a nine-month peak of 3.77% set on Feb. 9 as political turmoil
flared up.
The rise in oil prices has stirred up debate among policy makers and market participants on the outlook for
the Fed's monetary policy. Higher prices not only fan inflation that has roiled many countries around the
world, it also will act as a tax on consumers that could undermine the economic recovery in the U.S.
In his semiannual monetary-policy testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Bernanke said that,
while rising gasoline prices aren't yet a significant risk to the U.S. economy, a sustained rise in oil and
commodity prices could threaten the recovery.
Mr. Bernanke continued to signal that the economy isn't strong enough for the central bank to consider a
change in its accommodative monetary policy. The Fed is ready to respond to inflation, but inflation
expectations remain low, he said.

--- Page 92 ---
Page 92 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"Bernanke's long road to recovery and lack of inflationary concern are likely buying catalysts," said Kevin
Giddis, president of fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan Inc. in Memphis, Tenn.
Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index moved to 61.4 from 60.8 in
January. The ISM reading on manufacturing marked the index's highest performance since May 2004.

Stocks Slide as Oil Prices Rise --- Dow Tumbles 168.32 as Mideast Turmoil Inflames Worries About
Inflation

New York -- Widening tensions in the Mideast drove oil prices sharply higher, inflaming worries about
inflation and sending the stock market to its lowest close in a month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 168.32 points, or 1.38%, to finish at 12058.02, its third triple-digit
decline in the past week. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, already up 6% this year, jumped
2.7% to settle at $99.63 a barrel. They rose through $100 in after-hours electronic trading.
Gold reached a new nominal record.
Higher oil prices already are leaking into the U.S. economy through rising prices at the gas pump, which risk
curtailing consumers' spending on other products. Economists worry that the fragile U.S. recovery could be
stalled or thwarted by higher oil prices. That also drives up the cost of making goods, feeding into inflation.
"The higher the oil price goes and the longer it stays higher, the more it has a direct impact on growth by
curtailing it to some degree," said Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA Investment
Management Co.
Investors on Tuesday became increasingly alarmed at signs that the turmoil is spreading beyond Libya to far
larger oil exporters, including Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter,
accounting for about 9.4% of the global supply in January, while Iran is the third largest.
Fears of unrest intensified Tuesday in Saudi Arabia where authorities arrested a prominent Shiite cleric who
called for political reform. Iran reported clashes between protestors and security forces in Tehran.
Worries about inflation, and the need for a safe haven, drove investors into gold, which has recently
resumed a decade-long rally. On Tuesday, gold in New York settled at a new nominal record of $1,430.70 an
ounce.
"We've seen a lot safe-haven buying," said Frank McGhee, head precious-metal trader at Integrated
Brokerage Services in Chicago. Traders are closely watching how Asia and London open overnight, which
might bring in further buying to gold from institutional investors.
Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke did little to allay worries, investors said. He said he
is ready to respond as necessary to a surge in global commodity prices. Still, he cautioned that the recent rise
in commodity prices will lead to "at most a temporary and relatively modest increase" in inflation.
The S&P 500-stock index fell 20.89 points, or 1.57%, to finish at 1306.33, with declining volume outpacing
rising volume by a ratio of 8-to-1. The Nasdaq Composite fell 44.86 points, or 1.61%, to close at 2737.41.
The stock-market pullback comes after a six-month run that saw the market rise 22% since last September,
defying continuing concerns over European debt, a fight over U.S. tax policy and Chinese policy tightening.
"We're now phasing back to reality," said Christian Hviid, chief market strategist for Genworth Financial Asset
Management. "We got too complacent as a market, and now we're suddenly all paying attention to the risks a
bit more. Maybe the market just chose to ignore the challenges we had because of quantitative easing, or
growth in China -- now they can't ignore it any more."
With investors increasingly convinced that oil prices will stay elevated, market watchers and analysts are
beginning to sharply cut their growth estimates for the U.S., which relies heavily on oil imports.

--- Page 94 ---
Page 94 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
"Is growth going to come in at 4%, or more like 3% or 3.5%? If that's the new consensus, the market hasn't
priced that in yet and the market's got to correct," Mr. Hviid said. "Given the run-up we've had, we need some
breathing room to take in the new expectations."
Mr. Hviid said sharp rises in oil prices have almost always spelled recession.
International Energy Agency chief economist Fatih Birol said in an interview that if the price of oil averages
$100 a barrel this year, the U.S. would have to spend $385 billion on oil imports -- nearly $80 billion more
than it did last year.
Brent crude oil, traded in London, has roared 22% higher so far this year, adding 3.2% on Tuesday to
$115.42 a barrel, the highest settlement since Aug. 27, 2008.
"The market is taking some precaution; that's why all commodity traders are jumping up and down now," said
Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
Saudi Arabia's stock market tumbled 6.8% on Tuesday and is down 16% so far this year.
"If there are problems in Saudia Arabia, we will feel it" said Marc Pado, a U.S. market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald.

Investors Are Seeking Safety in New Harbors --- Dollar, Once a Favored Refuge, Loses Ground to Yen,
Franc

For years, whenever significant political or financial turmoil reared its head anywhere on the globe, investors
would turn to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven.
Yet as the chaos in North Africa has grown over the past month, investors have largely shunned the dollar
and sought shelter elsewhere.
They have turned to other traditional islands of stability, buying Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
What has especially raised eyebrows has been the move by investors to buy euros, a currency traditionally
seen as a riskier prospect than the dollar, especially with the euro zone's debt problems still largely
unresolved.
This has sparked a debate over whether the dollar has lost its safe-haven status.
"Over the last 20 years, people have always moved into the dollar on any sort of uncertainty in the global
economic space, but what we've seen over the past two weeks is actually a terrific move out of the dollar,"
says Douglas Borthwick, a managing director at Faros Trading in Stamford, Conn.
That, he says, reflects the emergence of a lack of confidence in the dollar as a safe place to stash money in
times of trouble, thanks in part to concerns about rising government budget deficits in the U.S.
Some say it reflects a broader move in global financial markets where, very slowly, the dollar is facing
competition from other currencies as a reserve currency.
Others see the lack of dollar buying as reflecting the specifics of the turmoil that started in Tunisia in late
January and has spread over the past month. The inflationary impact of rising oil prices is seen as tilting the
odds more in favor of interest-rate increases in Europe. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has said it still
believes core inflation is contained, despite rising energy prices.
So for now, the argument goes, there are better safe havens available to investors than the U.S. currency.
"Safe-haven buying is very dependent on the exact nature of the shock," says Jeff Young, head of North
American foreign-exchange research at Barclays Capital. "If it's a shock that triggers risk aversion, but the
underlying cost is going to hurt the U.S. disproportionately more than Switzerland, you wouldn't expect the
dollar to be on the list of safe havens."
Since Jan. 24, the day before protests began in Egypt that would ultimately topple its government, the dollar
has lost ground against the currencies of every one of so-called G-10 industrialized nations except the New
Zealand dollar, which has suffered in the wake of last week's earthquake.
The euro, in particular, has gained 1.2% against the dollar and traded at $1.3799 late Monday afternoon in
New York. The Swiss franc, meanwhile, has risen 2% against the dollar and the Japanese yen has gained
0.7%.
Even on individual days when events have sent a scare through the financial markets, the dollar hasn't
benefited.
On Jan. 25, when the protests in Egypt first flared up, the euro advanced more than two cents to almost
$1.39. This contrasts with other episodes of flight-to-safety currency buying in the past.
During the 2008 global financial crisis, the dollar rose by roughly 24%.

Analysts at BCA Research also point out that some investors also are looking to gold as a more appealing
safe-haven investment.
"We would agree with this assessment," the analysts wrote. Gold rose 5.7% in February, its biggest monthly
gain since April 2010.
When it comes to the buying of euros, many strategists point to the idea that the jump in oil prices over the
past few weeks has increased conviction among investors that the European Central Bank will be more likely
to raise interest rates before the year is out.
However, the Federal Reserve is widely seen as not viewing higher oil prices as an inflation risk and thus not
tightening monetary policy until 2012.
Some note that Japan's economy also is in the doldrums and the country imports essentially all its oil.
Yet buyers continued to seek out the yen as a safe haven. Investors aren't concerned about Japan's own
fiscal problems and loose monetary policy.
Mr. Borthwick at Faros says that focus on oil misses the point of flight-to-quality buying, which is that
investors are thinking first and foremost of moving their money somewhere safe where they can be sure they
will get it back.
With investors increasingly wary of the ability of the U.S. to solve its fiscal problems and the Fed perceived to
be "printing dollars" as part of its quantitative-easing strategy to support the economy, there's less confidence
that the U.S. dollar is "safe" in the sense, Mr. Borthwick says.
"It's the knee-jerk reaction that matters," he said. "Nowadays the knee-jerk reaction is buy euros and not to
buy dollars. The mindset of buying euros is a complete switch."

Dollar's Haven Allure Slips on the Oil Patch
The dollar is looking more like a frayed hammock than a safety net.
The greenback typically appreciates when global markets are in "risk-off" mode. During the financial crisis, it
surged roughly 24% against a basket of major currencies. It jumped about 10% during last spring's "flash
crash" and European sovereign-debt crisis.
But the latest bout of market angst, spurred by revolutions and unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,
hasn't prompted a similar rally. In fact, the opposite has occurred.
That illustrates a key difference between this wave of risk aversion and previous ones: It is driven not by a
financial crisis, but by a spike in oil prices. And in coming days and weeks, any continued upward march by
black gold will likely put further pressure on the dollar.
The main reason is that oil is the Achilles' heel of the U.S. economy. America's energy intensity has declined
in recent years, but still is higher than that of Europe or Japan, according to the World Bank. Toronto-based
broker Brockhouse Cooper reckons a spike in oil prices to $130 a barrel would lower U.S.
industrial-production growth from roughly 5% annually to about 4%. It would cost consumers upward of $100
billion this year, wiping out much of the boost from the payroll-tax cut, according to Capital Economics.
Such concerns have reduced already low odds the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. Yet
the opposite is true of the European Central Bank, Nomura Securities currency strategist Jens Nordvig
points out. The ECB targets headline inflation. In contrast, the Fed focuses on core inflation, which
excludes volatile food and energy costs. This means the ECB is "more likely to pull the trigger" in response to
higher gas prices, he says. Even if that ultimately proves self-defeating, it adds to short-term support for the
euro relative to the dollar.
Whatever safe-haven allure the dollar has lost in this oil shock, currencies like the Swiss franc, Norwegian
krone and Canadian dollar have gained. And it is no wonder: The latter two are big oil exporters, while all
have higher interest rates and lower energy intensity than the U.S.
No wonder the franc scaled new heights Thursday. The dollar, meanwhile, may continue to stumble.

Wealthy Areas Again See Rise In Home Prices
Wealthy Areas Again See Rise In Home Prices

New York area home prices have held up better than most other major metropolitan areas, with wealthy
commuting suburbs providing the bulk of recovery while towns farther from the city have lagged, brokers and
analysts said.
Those mixed results came after a national survey this week found that December home prices in the New
York metropolitan area hit their lowest level since 2004, according to the S&P/Case Shiller Index.
For the more affluent towns in the tri-state area, last year's slowdown may already be passing. Brokers say
confidence is returning after the stock market touched a post-financial crisis high and Wall Street bonuses
poured in.
Jason Wachtel, who runs a small but booming executive-search business, decided to take a $10,000 loss on
a co-op in Great Neck on Long Island and is now in contract to buy a much larger house for nearly $1 million
in nearby Lake Success, after he fell in love with the area, and found prices reasonable. "Also," he said,
"business has been good to me."
In Westchester County, the number of signed contracts in 2011 for homes priced at $1 million or more is up
more than 25% compared with the same period in 2010, according to real-estate broker Houlihan Lawrence.
But for much of the rest of the area, the recovery has been more muted. "There appears to be a growing rift
between the commuter towns and those further from the city," says Chris Meyers, Houlihan Lawrence's chief
operating officer.
Westchester home sales last year were up 20% over 2009, according to Houlihan Lawrence. But in Putnam
County -- home to fewer Manhattan commuters and more dependent on the local economy -- sales were up
only 5% in 2010; in even more distant Dutchess County, home sales declined for the fifth straight year.
Overall, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index showed New York area home prices falling 2.3% in
December from the year-ago period. That dragged the region's home price index to its lowest level since
March 2004.
Some economists say the price dips here and nationwide reflect a rising number of distressed sales, plus the
end in April of a tax credit for home-buyers of up to $8,000.
The index, which measures re-sales of single-family homes and excludes condos, co-ops, townhouses and
new homes, doesn't catch most home sales in New York City. But it does capture the bulk of activity in the
surrounding areas.
Maureen Maitland, vice president of S&P Indices, said the New York area's index annual decline was the
sixth smallest of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas covered by the index.
She said New York home prices in December were still about 68% above price levels in 2000. It's one of just
five metro areas with prices more than 50% above their 2000 levels.
Two factors largely influence home prices, Ms. Maitland said: the ability of the local economy to produce
enough jobs and the number of homes on the market. Cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix suffered from a
supply glut in a way that was less common in the New York area.
In Fairfield County, Conn., home to many finance professionals and other Manhattan commuters, sales
showed signs of rebounding last year, albeit after a sluggish 2009.

--- Page 102 ---
Page 102 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
For eight towns in lower Fairfield County, combined sales were up 26% in 2010 over the previous year,
though most prices remain subdued, said Gregory Heym, chief economist for Terra Holdings, parent
company of brokers Halstead Property.
The picture is cloudier in New Jersey. Jeffrey G. Otteau, an appraiser and president of the Otteau Valuation
Group, found that median prices statewide rose 1% between 2009 and 2010.
But it rose by 5.7% in affluent towns like Glen Ridge, Chatham, Summit and Millburn that provide direct rail
service to midtown Manhattan.
Median prices fell the most, 8.2%, in what he called "the Gold Coast" towns along the Hudson -- such as
Jersey City, Hoboken and North Bergen.
On Long Island, brokers told a similar tale. A report released a few weeks ago by Prudential Douglas Elliman
found that median prices were down in the last quarter by 5.6% compared with the previous quarter, but still
up overall by 1.6% from a year earlier.
Mona Holzman, director of the Prudential Douglas Elliman office in Great Neck, said the market was busy but
uneven, with some properties there were selling quickly for more than she expected, while others linger on
the market.
Her main worry now, is that a further rise in interest rates could put a lid on prices, or even push them down
further.

Middle East Roils Markets --- Oil Soars, Stocks Fall as Libyan Rebels Take Energy Zone; Ports Are Closed
Middle East Roils Markets --- Oil Soars, Stocks Fall as Libyan Rebels Take Energy Zone; Ports Are

Libya's descent into violence rattled global financial markets Tuesday, sending oil prices surging to their
biggest gain in more than two years and driving world stock markets sharply lower.
U.S. crude oil prices soared 8.5% to $93.57 a barrel as worries grew that the troubles in Libya may cut off
some of the world's oil supplies. European crude prices settled at $105.78 a barrel.
The threat of higher oil prices sent stock markets from Tokyo to Paris to New York tumbling. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average dropped 1.4% to 12212.79. In early Wednesday trading, Asian stocks were mixed, coming
off sharp losses posted Tuesday.
Until now, financial markets have looked on with relative calm as leaders in Egypt and Tunisia were ousted
and unrest spread across the region. But the destabilizing of Libya is more alarming to investors because it is
a major oil producer -- ranking as OPEC's 10th largest crude exporter -- with 44 billion barrels of proven
reserves that represent more than 3% of the global total.
Rising oil prices come just as the global economic recovery is showing signs of gaining traction. Higher fuel
costs are cited by economists as among the biggest threats to that recovery, as they increase the cost to
produce food and other goods and act as a drag on consumption of everything from appliances to
entertainment. U.S. prices, though, are still 36% below the 2008 record.
"This has the potential to be more disruptive to energy markets, and that has a bigger impact on economic
success," said Jonathan Golub, market strategist at UBS AG. "That's why the market is freaking out."
Scenes of Libya's bloody crackdown on protestors, which has left at least 300 dead and prompted
multinational companies to close operations, filled television screens during the trading day. Libya's leader
Col. Moammar Gadhafi added to anxiety as he vowed to remain in the country "until the end." In a televised
speech, Col. Gadhafi said he is prepared to die as a "martyr" rather than leave.
Financial markets fear the turmoil in Libya could spread further across the Middle East -- home to 57% of the
world's total oil reserves and 30% of global oil production. Though Gulf producers like Saudi Arabia are
well-shielded from a full-blown uprising of the kind seen in Libya, "the instability in this region is likely to be a
major source of lasting unease in the oil market," said Helma Croft, an oil analyst at Barclays Capital.
Oil-producing nations sought to calm investors. Leading producers from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries said they would open the spigots if needed to make up for lost Libyan crude, while the
International Energy Agency said its member countries might release emergency oil stocks if required.
It's not clear whether Tuesday's jump in oil will prove temporary or mark the start of a longer ascent. And
even with today's leap, U.S. oil prices are well below the record of almost $150 per barrel set in July 2008.
The rise has been gradual, which helps eliminate big shocks to the economy, and economists in a Wall Street
Journal survey published last week said oil prices would need to rise to about $127 a barrel to hurt economic
growth, well above current levels.
Still, concerns that the unrest in Libya could disrupt global oil supplies intensified Tuesday as more oil
companies suspended operations there. Two big European oil companies with extensive operations in Libya
-- Repsol SA of Spain and Eni SpA of Italy -- halted production, while Eni shut down a pipeline that brings
natural gas from Libya across the Mediterranean Sea to Italy.
All Libyan ports -- including Zawia, Tripoli, Benghazi and Misurata -- have been closed, traders in the country
said. They said they expect the ports to be reopened in two to three days. A vessel owned by Eni has been
asked to leave Zawia, said people familiar with the oil and shipping market. An Eni spokesman wasn't
immediately available to comment.

As much as 550,000 barrels a day of production may now be shut in -- about a third of Libya's normal
production. Meanwhile, some Libyan tribes have threatened to halt oil exports from the regions they control.
Oil companies in eastern Libya are functioning under the control of pro-democracy rebels, local oil officials
said. The directors of the Arabian Gulf Oil Co., a subsidiary of Libya's National Oil Co., announced their split
with Mr. Gadhafi and pledged loyalty to the people, according to the officials.
"The company is still producing and its one refinery is operating at capacity," said Ahmed Sharif, head of
Arabian Gulf Oil Co.'s well construction department. "The people control it."
Middle East upheaval has a long history of driving oil prices higher. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, oil
prices surged to a then-record high of $39.50 a barrel in April 1980, an inflation-adjusted record that stood
until the rally that ended in 2008. In the run-up to the first Gulf War in 1990, oil prices surged by about
one-third, and they jumped again in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Tuesday's rise in U.S. crude oil
prices was the largest in dollar terms since 2008.
As U.S. oil prices hurtled toward $100 a barrel, domestic investors began to tally up the potential impact.
Higher crude oil would add to the threat already posed by higher commodity prices, heaping new burdens
onto struggling consumers.
That may present a challenge for the U.S. stock market, which has been on a six-month-long upward march.
Before Tuesday's drop, the Dow had been up 7% in 2011, its best start to the year since 1997, defying many
skeptics who have been calling for a pullback. A threat like higher oil prices is particularly worrisome given the
fragility of the economy. "This is like driving through a pothole, and you get a jolt," said Rick Bensignor, chief
market strategist at Dahlman Rose, a New York investment bank focused on energy and commodities.
"Today could be somewhat of a psychological changer."
The dollar jumped higher against the euro overnight, though it later gave back much of those gains.
Investors fled to the safety of U.S. Treasury bonds, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to
its lowest level since Feb. 1. Yields rise as prices fall. Gold prices rose to $1,400.50 per troy ounce, near the
all-time high in nominal terms of $1,422.60, hit on Jan. 3.
Pricier oil also cast a long shadow over corporate earnings, darkening the outlook for airlines that must buy
fuel and retailers that have been hoping for lower unemployment. Retail gas prices have already risen 4.5%
this year, to $3.19 a gallon, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, despite a decline in U.S.
crude oil prices.
Every sector of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished in negative territory, and all but 31 of S&P 500
stocks fell. Delta Air Lines fell 6.6%, Southwest Airlines dropped 5.5% and American Airlines operator AMR
fell 5.7%.
When oil prices spiked three years ago, the economy was coming off a long period of prosperity and
consumers felt relatively strong. This rise comes after three of the most challenging years in decades for the
global economy, at a time when U.S. unemployment is persistently high.
"Some of my customers don't make enough to heat their homes and to pay for their food and medicine," said
Sherry Greene, 53, owner of Greene's Oil & Propane in White River Junction, Vt.
"I see the frustration when my customers come in and talk about it--I had one gentleman call today and say,
'I've got to get my fuel today before oil rises," she said. "Everything that's happening in the Middle East is
impacting us."

Silver Keeps Climbing in London

Silver Keeps Climbing in London

LONDON -- The spot price of silver broke $33 a troy ounce, making further headway into territory not seen
since 1980, but some market participants are concerned the market is at risk of overextending itself.
Gold prices also rose, pushing through $1,400 an ounce.
Late Monday in London, silver traded at $33.76 an ounce, up $1.10, or 3.4%, from late Friday in New York,
not long after hitting a 31-year high of $33.82 an ounce.
Prices haven't been this high since the market was caught in a squeeze by the Hunt brothers in 1980.
Trading was thin across all metals because of the Presidents Day holiday in the U.S.
Like gold, silver is sought as a store of value in times of economic or political uncertainty. The metal is
benefiting from rising global inflation rates and political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East.
But, unlike gold, silver also is considered an industrial metal, with 60% of its demand coming from industry.
Strong growth in the electronics and solar-power sectors, both of which use silver, is bolstering physical
demand for the metal.
But some said technical factors also are coming into play and are exaggerating its upward trajectory,
The relatively small size of the silver market makes it more volatile than gold, resulting in more pronounced
rallies and corrections.
As such, if the mood toward the metal sours, silver could see a pronounced slide, said analysts.
"Shifts in market sentiment tend to trigger bigger corrections in silver than in gold prices," said BNP Paribas
analyst Anne-Laure Tremblay, adding technical indicators suggest silver may be "overbought."
The rush to buy silver also is putting downward pressure on the ratio between gold and silver prices. This, in
turn, is serving to cement positive sentiment toward silver, said market participants.
Spot gold was up $16.90, or 1.2%, at $1,406 an ounce. To some, a move above December's record gold
price of $1,431.30 an ounce looks within reach.
Platinum and palladium also rose. Spot platinum was at $1,850 an ounce, up $18, or 1.1%, while spot
palladium traded at $858 an ounce, up $9, or 1.1%.

Corporate News -- The Week Ahead: Retailers Suit Up for Holiday Results
Corporate News -- The Week Ahead: Retailers Suit Up for Holiday Results
By Ann Zimmerman

From Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Kohl's Corp. and Gap Inc., almost every major retailer reports fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings this week, and the results will be the final word on whether holiday shoppers were
naughty or nice to the country's chain stores.
Despite cold, snowy weather that walloped major swaths of the country in January, and uneven sales
throughout the sector in December, the early consensus is that retailers for the most part posted solid
earnings growth for the quarter. That's due in part to a robust November that lured shoppers with discounts
galore as well as the retailers' ability to keep inventories and expenses in line after having tough lessons
learned during the recession.
That's the good news. With mounting prices on everything from fuel and food to cotton, retailers still are
expected to offer muted full-year earnings guidance for 2011. Broad inflation hasn't beset clothing makers
and sellers in almost two decades and rising costs will pose a quandary for stores: Do they pass those higher
costs onto still-strapped consumers, who may in turn buy less? Or do they absorb some of the cost and take
a hit to their gross profit margins?
The first half of the year poses additional challenges, particularly for department stores and discounter Target
Corp. They will be lapping their toughest sales comparisons from a year ago.
"Most companies will provide conservative, cautiously optimistic guidance due to increasingly tough
comparisons, erratic consumer spending trends (with a growing divide between wealthy and poor) and
perhaps most importantly, apparel inflation," Bill Dreher, retail analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a recent
report.
Wall Street analysts are dubious that when Wal-Mart reports earnings on Tuesday it will have managed to
reverse a U.S. sales slump that has seen the world's largest retailer post negative same-store sales for a year
and a half. The Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain has been beset by a series of missteps, including a
disruptive chainwide remodeling initiative and an effort to declutter the stores by reducing thousands of
products from store shelves.
After reversing course earlier this year, Wal-Mart forecast fourth-quarter same-store sales ranging from a 1%
drop to a 2% gain, but analysts are concerned Wal-Mart's latest efforts have yet to bear fruit.
Macy's, which reports Tuesday as well, has focused on tailoring its merchandise to regional tastes. The
strategy helped the department-store chain end the quarter with a same-store sales gain of 4.2%. Coupled
with inventories that have been growing at a slower rate than sales, some analysts predict that Macy's might
beat its earnings target of between $1.44 and $1.49 a share. In an attempt to get a jump on rising commodity
prices, Macy's has been working with its vendors to lock in prices.
Gap raised its quarterly guidance in early February, due more to controlling its expenses rather than
stronger-than-expected sales. The improvement at its namesake stores is still coming in fits and starts and
investors expect Gap's exposure to cotton, of which the price has more than doubled to $2 a pound in the
past 12 months, to pressure earnings for the year.
BASF's Outlook
To Provide Insight
When BASF SE reports full-year earnings Thursday, the German chemical company's outlook should provide
some insight into how much of last year's momentum will carry into 2011.

--- Page 109 ---
Page 109 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Although the strong recovery is likely to slow this year, the chemicals sector should retain considerable
momentum, with growth coming primarily from emerging markets -- in particular, from Asia and South
America.
Industry bellwether BASF is known for cautious guidance, and its full-year results, like those of most of its
European peers, are expected to echo the broad recovery in global chemicals demand, indicated most
recently by results from Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., both of which reported
fourth-quarter volumes increased 12%.
"Order intake has been strong lately at BASF and everything is pointing to further growth," at least for the
next three months, said Lars Hettche of Metzler Equities, who expects BASF to give a generally rosy outlook
for 2011.
BASF boosted its 2010 guidance in October after the expected summer slump never materialized.
But BASF has warned that the brisk business of 2010 may not continue at the same pace in 2011, and voiced
concerns about volatile raw-materials costs and currency markets, production overcapacity, protectionist
trade barriers and the world's fragile economic recovery.
Analysts said that was because demand for chemicals had outpaced supply in the first half of 2010 for an
industry that was still waking up from the 2009 downturn.

Silver prices neared 31-year highs on a brightening outlook for the global economy and as inflation concerns
have revived.
Silver for February delivery rose 72.6 cents, or 2.3%, to settle at $32.2980 a troy ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the metal's strongest close since March 1980.
"It's benefiting from optimism," said Ralph Preston, market analyst at Heritage West Financial.
Silver is a precious metal but unlike gold it has far more industrial applications. Because it is significantly
cheaper than gold, which settled at $1,388.20 an ounce Friday, silver is becoming a popular way to hedge
against rising prices, with inflation gaining in Europe and China.
While inflation in the U.S. remains tame, some believe the Federal Reserve won't be able to control
longer-term price pressures stemming from ultralow interest rates and Fed purchases of Treasurys to
stimulate the economy.
At the same time, the economic growth that is sparking inflation fears also is prompting a resurgence in
manufacturing and consumer purchases.
Silver has gained 4.5% this year and 20% from a two-month low hit Jan. 25. In 1980, the Hunt brothers of
Texas attempted to corner the silver market and pushed prices above $40 a troy ounce.
"It's a much more orderly market" nowadays, said Stephen Flood, director of Dublin-based bullion dealer
GoldCore.
Commercial traders, like silver miners, have been adding to their short positions in futures contracts
throughout February, a sign they are locking in prices. The commercial net short has risen to 50,796 lots in
the week ended Feb. 15, from 44,340 lots at the start of the month, according to the latest data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Mexican company Minera Frisco SAB is hedging production as it seeks to bring previously unprofitable silver
projects online, while miners such as Sweden's Boliden AB and U.S. Silver Corp. also set hedging deals for
2011.

Retiring Boomers Find 401(k) Plans Fall Short
Retiring Boomers Find 401(k) Plans Fall Short

The 401(k) generation is beginning to retire, and it isn't a pretty sight.
The retirement savings plans that many baby boomers thought would see them through old age are falling
short in many cases.
The median household headed by a person aged 60 to 62 with a 401(k) account has less than one-quarter of
what is needed in that account to maintain its standard of living in retirement, according to data compiled by
the Federal Reserve and analyzed by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College for The Wall
Street Journal. Even counting Social Security and any pensions or other savings, most 401(k) participants
appear to have insufficient savings. Data from other sources also show big gaps between savings and what
people need, and the financial crisis has made things worse.
This analysis uses estimates of 401(k) balances from the end of 2010 and of salaries from 2009. It assumes
people need 85% of their working income after they retire in order to maintain their standard of living, a
common yardstick.
Facing shortfalls, many people are postponing retirement, moving to cheaper housing, buying less-expensive
food, cutting back on travel, taking bigger risks with their investments and making other sacrifices they never
imagined.
"Inevitably, we find that, for the average person, there is not enough there," says financial adviser Paul Merritt
of NTrust Wealth Management in Virginia Beach, Va., who has found himself advising many retirement-age
people with too little savings. "The discussion turns out to be: What kind of part-time work do you want to do
after you retire?"
He has clients contemplating part-time work into their 70s, he says.
Tax-deferred 401(k) retirement accounts came into wide use in the 1980s, making baby boomers trying to
retire now among the first to rely heavily on them.
The problems are widespread, especially among middle-income earners. About 60% of households nearing
retirement age have 401(k)-type accounts, according to government data, and those represent the majority of
most people's savings. The situation is less dire for those in a higher income bracket, who tend to save more
outside their 401(k) accounts and who have more margin for error if their retirement returns fall below the
recommended 85% figure.
Steven Rutschmann, 60 years old, manages the buildings and grounds at a Midwest research facility. His
employer recently offered him a bonus if he retired early.
Mr. Rutschmann's 401(k) is well into six figures. His wife has a 401(k) and expects a small pension from her
nursing job. An outdoorsman, he dreams of spending time hunting, fishing and hiking.
So he consulted a financial planner at Ernst & Young and learned that even with the bonus, his savings could
run out before he turns 85. Now he expects to work for several more years.
"I was disappointed," says Mr. Rutschmann, whose 401(k) balance was damaged by the financial crisis and
who still has a large mortgage.
In general, people facing problems today got too little advice, or bad advice. They didn't realize that a 6%
annual contribution, with a 3% company match, might not be enough.

Some started saving too late or suspended contributions when they or their spouses lost jobs. Others
borrowed against 401(k) accounts for medical emergencies or ran up debts too close to their planned
retirement dates.
In the stock-market collapses of 2000-2002 and 2007-2009, many people were over-invested in stocks. Some
bailed out after the market collapse, suffering on the way down and then missing the rebound.
Initially envisioned as a way for management-level people to put aside extra retirement money, the 401(k)
was embraced by big companies in the 1980s as a replacement for costly pension funds. Suddenly, they
were able to transfer the burden of funding employees' retirement to the employees themselves. Employees
had control over their savings, and were able carry them to new jobs.
They were a gold mine for money-management firms. In 30 years, the 401(k) went from a small program to a
multi-trillion-dollar industry supporting thousands of financial planners and money managers.
But a 401(k) also requires steady, significant savings. And unlike corporate pension plans, which are
guaranteed by the U.S. government, 401(k) plans have no such backstop.
The government and employers aren't going to pay more for people's retirements. Unless people begin
saving earlier and contributing more to their 401(k) plans, advisers say, they are destined to hit retirement
age with too little money.
Vanguard Group, one of the biggest providers of 401 (k) plans, has changed its advice on how much people
should save. Vanguard long advised people to put 9% to 12% of their salaries -- including the employer
contribution -- in their 401(k) plans. The current median amount that people contribute is 9%, counting the
employer contribution, Vanguard says.
Recently, Vanguard has begun urging people to contribute 12% to 15%, including the employer contribution,
because of the stock market's weak returns and uncertainty about the future of Social Security and Medicare.
Plans of younger people have been affected too. Of those 45 to 59 who had substantial retirement assets
prior to the downturn, 40% planned to work longer, according to a study by the Center for Retirement
Research.
Gloria Moss has been contributing to a 401(k) since 1985, when she went back to work after having children.
Especially after divorcing, she wasn't able to contribute as much as she wished and when her children
finished college, she focused on repaying college loans. She says she lost more than half her savings in the
recent financial crisis, then shifted heavily to bonds and missed the stock rebound.
"I thought I was doing the right thing, and found out otherwise," she says. When she consulted a financial
adviser, "I got a report that said, 'You have a 5% chance of reaching your retirement goal'."
In her early 60s, she is ready to retire, but if she does that now, "I will have $25,000 to $30,000 a year less
than I anticipated having," she says.
To retire at her current standard of living, she figures, she needs nearly twice the savings she has now.
Dr. Moss, who has a Ph.D. in education, also made good decisions along the way. She saw trouble coming at
the educational software company where she worked and found a new job a week after losing hers.
Now she has sold the condominium she loved, near the Atlantic Ocean, and moved to a cheaper house. She
cut back on vacations and meals out. She adores the theater but hasn't been to a play in at least a year.
She works extra hours each week and contributes to her employer's version of a 401(k), but doesn't feel
financially able to contribute the maximum amount.
"I am going to probably have to work considerably longer than I anticipated," she says. "It is a nice job but I
had not planned to be working well into my sixties," she says. "A lot of people are doing that. They need the
money."
It isn't possible to calculate precisely how many people are able to cover the recommended 85% of their
pre-retirement income, but Federal Reserve data suggest that many people can't.
Consider households headed by people aged 60 to 62, nearing retirement, with a 401(k)-type account at their
jobs.
Such households had a median income of $87,700 in 2009, according to data from the Center for Retirement
Research at Boston College, which derived this and other numbers by updating Fed survey data, at The
Journal's request. The 85% needed for retirement would be $74,545 a year.

Experts estimate Social Security will provide as much as 40% of pre-retirement income, or $35,080 a year for
that median family. That leaves $39,465 needed from other sources. Most 401(k) accounts don't come close
to making up that gap.
The median 401(k) plan held $149,400, including plans from previous jobs, according to the Center for
Retirement Research. To figure the annual income from that, analysts typically look at what the family would
get from a fixed annuity.
That $149,400 would generate just $9,073 a year for a couple, according to New York Life Insurance Co., the
leading provider of such annuities -- less than one-quarter of the $39,465 needed.
Just 8% of households approaching retirement have the $636,673 or more in their 401(k)s that would be
needed to generate $39,465 a year.
Some families do have other income. Just under half expect pension income of a median $26,500 a year.
Added to the $9,073 in 401(k) income, that still falls short. Some families have other savings, but Federal
Reserve and other data suggest that those don't fill the gap for most people.
These data don't even include people who are in the direst situations: Those who have lost their jobs,
stopped contributing to 401(k) plans or shifted to jobs without 401(k) plans. The numbers also don't account
for inflation, which would further eat into income from a 401(k).
Some researchers question the Fed numbers because they are based on surveys rather than on records of
actual contributions.
Jack VanDerhei, head of research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a group supported by 401(k)
providers, estimates the median person actually has about $158,754, based on data from 401(k) providers.
That is based on individuals in their 60s who have been at the same company for more than 30 years, a
somewhat different group than that measured by the Fed data.
Even that amount of 401(k) savings generates much less than what is needed.
The difficulties have been worsened by the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Since the housing and financial
markets began to collapse, about 39% of all Americans have been foreclosed upon, unemployed, underwater
on a mortgage or behind more than two months on a mortgage, says Michael Hurd, director of the Rand
Corporation's Center for the Study of Aging.
In 2008, when he was 59, John Mastej figured he was on track to retire in his early 60s. He and his wife both
were working, with 401(k) plans. Counting all their savings, they had close to $200,000. Mr. Mastej was
putting 20% of his salary into his 401(k).
The financial collapse cut their savings in half and left Mr. Mastej out of work for two years, with no 401(k)
contributions. He had to dip into other savings and use up an inheritance to pay the mortgage. He found a
new job in a specialty food store, but it paid much less than his old one in a plastics factory.
Today, Mr. Mastej figures he has about $90,000 in savings left, including about $50,000 from the two 401(k)s,
now mostly in a fixed annuity that isn't affected by the stock market. He and his wife have canceled their
satellite television and drive 11-year-old cars to work.
They buy some food at discounted prices through their church, but are proud they have remained current on
their mortgage, home-equity loan, insurance and property taxes.
"We don't go out to dinner. We don't do much entertaining," Mr. Mastej says. "I will probably end up having to
work for another 10 years."
Carol Dailey is continuing to work at age 71. Ms. Dailey spent 10 years as an executive assistant at America
Online and had stock options she figures were once worth $1.7 million. The options' value collapsed with the
company's stock.
Now she relies on her 401(k), which took a hit in the 2008 market plunge. She has cut back spending for
entertainment and organic food, and continues to work three days a week as an office manager for an
Internet security company.
"At AOL, we were buying $60 bottles of wine and not blinking. Now I drink box wine," she says.
Eventually, she wants to retire completely. Then, to make ends meet, she plans to take bigger investment
risks. Her financial adviser then will shift some of her savings out of an annuity and into high-yielding bonds
and real-estate investment trusts, aiming to double the return on that money to 10% a year.

Some people were done in by the twin collapses of the housing and stock markets.
Patti and Bob Webster had accumulated a six-figure balance in their 401(k) accounts and were building a
dream house in North Carolina in 2007. They planned to retire there in about a year. Then their builder went
out of business and the stock collapse knocked 40% off their savings. They temporarily suspended 401(k)
contributions.
"We thought we had the perfect plan," says Patti Webster. "When the bottom fell out of the market, it kind of
fell out of our perfect plan as well."
Today in their mid-60s, they have completed the house but have worked two years longer than planned and
expect to work two years more.
"We are having to spend another two years in just trying to catch up with what the market did to us," Ms.
Webster says.

Investors have been flocking to precious metals as a safe haven, boosting prices for the likes of gold and
platinum. But that's putting a squeeze on companies that use the metals in industries as varied as
construction equipment and film making.
Precious metals tend to keep their value even as inflation and economic uncertainty hurt investments like
stocks and bonds. That has fueled a flood of investment in exchange-traded funds, which track benchmark
indexes that are backed by gold and other metals.
"There's been a lavish courtship from the ETFs into this sector," says Jon Nadler, senior analyst at bullion
dealer Kitco Metals Inc. At $1,828 a troy ounce, platinum is up more than 20% from a year ago. Many
consumer products -- including cars, consumer electronics and pharmaceuticals -- either contain platinum or
require it for processing, Mr. Nadler says.
For its cement mixers and truck cranes, Terex Corp. buys engines with emissions-control devices containing
platinum and palladium, the latter of which has nearly doubled in price from last year to $832 a troy ounce.
With its engine suppliers facing higher costs for the metals, Terex is bracing for higher prices when its
contracts are adjusted this summer, says Timothy Fiore, senior vice president of supply management for the
Westport, Conn., company.
Corning Inc. uses platinum and rhodium to line the melting tanks it uses to make glass for television sets and
other consumer electronics. The Corning, N.Y., company has stockpiled $2 billion in metals, mostly platinum
and rhodium, says company Treasurer Mark Rogus. Rhodium, which isn't traded on a commodities
exchange, has fluctuated between $2,300 and $2,925 an ounce since early last year, he says. To reduce the
risk of higher prices, Corning has entered contracts that pay around $2,300 an ounce for rhodium and
between $1,400 and $1,600 an ounce for platinum.
"Our main objective is to provide certainty of the price, rather than speculation," Mr. Rogus says. The
company could take a hit, however, if either metal's price decreases below the prices Corning has locked in.
"We'd love to get it cheap, but we're under no illusion that we can beat the market," he says.
Corning's researchers have been exploring ways to rely less on the metals or find substitute materials, but
they haven't had any luck, Mr. Rogus says.
The company has ruled out raising prices to its customers, who are also squeezed by higher costs and
consumer skittishness.
Silver prices have soared to more than $30 an ounce from $18 a troy ounce in the last year. Though the
world has roughly a 5,000-ton surplus of silver, prices for the metal closed last year at their highest level in
three decades, says Suki Cooper, a precious-metals analyst with Barclays Capital.
That is pinching the film industry. For every dollar increase in silver's price per ounce, Eastman Kodak Co.'s
earnings are hurt between $10 million and $15 million, says Brad Kruchten, president of the Rochester, N.Y.,
company's film group.
Kodak this year started indexing the price of its film to silver prices. "Customers in general don't like that,"
Chief Executive Antonio Perez told investors earlier this month. But he said customers understand the
rationale.
Kodak also continues to enter hedging contracts on silver -- essentially, insuring against sharp price
increases -- and it is working to shift toward digital services.
Fujifilm Holdings Corp. raised prices 10% on its silver-halide photographic paper and print materials in the
U.S. The company also increased prices between 5% and 20% world-wide on photographic paper.

NEW YORK -- All signs point to dollar strength and euro weakness in the coming days as an array of issues
from the future of Egypt to euro-zone sovereign debt remain unresolved.
With questions still looming about the post-Mubarak era in Egypt and the Middle East, as well as the euro
zone's persistent debt problems, haven currencies and assets could find more favor, analysts said.
The Swiss franc, Japanese yen and gold rank highly among the safety nets that, like the dollar, could attract
buying interest.
Initially, traders unwound some haven positions after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned on Friday.
But those moves quickly faded as market participants gravitated toward safer assets.
And traders widely believe that drift will continue. The euro fell to $1.3547 late Friday, more than 1% below its
highest level of the week.
"In the short run, there's probably more uncertainty than less" now that Mr. Mubarak is gone, said Aroop
Chatterjee, chief foreign-exchange quantitative strategist at Barclays Capital. "It's not clear when elections will
happen. It's not clear really who is in control."
The lack of answers, Mr. Chatterjee said, makes the dollar and other havens more appealing investments
right now. "You would have to be long in safe-haven currencies," Mr. Chatterjee said. The euro is considered
a riskier asset, so it typically declines at times of risk aversion.
Not only will the transition of power be a key question for traders, the potential spillover effects on the region
are a major uncertainty, as well.
"Does this fire jump the burn line and set ablaze a Gulf oil producer?" said David Gilmore a partner at Foreign
Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. Mr. Gilmore said that if it did, it would pose serious problems for the
global economy because of the potential impact on oil prices. If the issue remains contained to Egypt, the
effect on financial markets could be minimal, he said.
Uncertainty about the Middle East could last indefinitely. Yet markets are adept at adapting.
"Markets get used to crisis," said Axel Merk, chief Investment officer of Merk Investments in Palo Alto, Calif.
"The first time it happens, it rocks the world," Mr. Merk said of crises.
But each subsequent follow-up shock has a smaller effect on the market.
Diminished concern over Egypt could allow other topics to have a bigger impact on currencies. Analysts said
European sovereign debt-concerns are like to emerge once more as a determining factor in trading.
The euro was hurt recently and is likely to continue to struggle because of "policy makers' inability to agree on
any measures to resolve debt problems," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign
Exchange in Washington.
Sovereign-debt yields in some of the euro zone's weaker countries, like Portugal and Spain, will be closely
watched to see how traders feel about the 17-nation bloc's debt situation. If yields on Portuguese or Spanish
debt rise, that would show investors aren't confident in these countries' ability to improve their economies and
manage their deficits, which would be negative for the euro and benefit the dollar.
Analysts said the European Central Bank recently entered the market to buy Portuguese debt, a sign that
worries about the fiscal health of the euro zone are resurfacing.

'There's a big difference between men's fashion and menswear," said Paul Trible, the 30-year-old owner of
the Newport News, Va.-based shirting company, Ledbury. "Most men are somewhat nervous about being
labeled fashionable." This sentiment is one shared by a crop of up-and-coming designers producing
trend-allergic clothing that's all about fit, quality and, above all, understatement. Before launching his line, Mr.
Trible lived in London, working at an international aid agency, where he gained an appreciation for the codes
of British shirt making. His firm now sells an average of 1,500 of their distinctive Anglo-American cutaway
collar shirts monthly. "Under the menswear umbrella you can do things with fit and color -- nothing too
outrageous -- but still respect the way men want to dress," Mr. Trible said.
When Kirk Miller, 32, started his nine-month-old made-to-measure label, Miller's Oath, he looked to his family
roots for inspiration. In the 19th century, the Miller family sold dry goods to gold rush miners in Groton, South
Dakota -- a heritage he hints at with his choice of emblem: a pick-axe. His small store west of New York's
SoHo neighborhood is a testament to his rare eye for cut and fabric -- his wares recently won him a
nomination for best menswear designer in America from GQ -- but also to the discreetly booming business of
bespoke. His jackets echo the shape of a dandy tailcoat, and Mr. Miller's shirts have an unusual cutaway
collar reminiscent of a bank teller in a Sergio Leone Western. "I love the idea of history, but this isn't a general
store from 1895. I like to keep my clothes elegant and timeless but also like to play with proportions in an
updated sense," he said. While Miller's operation is highly specialized and utilizes local New York
manufacturing -- his suits run to around $3,000 -- many of the new tailors are looking to create volume
businesses by scaling up production as well as minimizing costs with foreign manufacturing.
The big players in this fast-bespoke market include David Shottenstein's Astor and Black. Wildly popular with
professional athletes, the label had so many clients playing in last Sunday's Super Bowl, Mr. Schottenstein
couldn't pick a team to support. But this isn't your father's style of tailor, asking discreetly if you dress left or
right -- it's suiting that's technology dependent and rapidly produced and delivered. Established in 2004 when
Mr. Shottenstein was just 22, the company is now a $20 million business boasting testimonials from Oracle's
Larry Ellison and hook-ups with Bentley, who offer customers a bespoke Astor and Black suit, shirt and tie
with the purchase of a car. Now 21, Mr. Schottenstein says the growing demand for custom made clothes --
which has, surprisingly, increased since the economic downturn -- has lead to manufacturing innovations that
have produced savings that can be passed on to the customer. "When economic times are challenging, any
advantage is useful," Mr. Schottenstein said. "Impressions are everything. When you walk into a meeting you
should be put together nicely."
Many of this new breed of tailor are also looking to bring the exclusivity of bespoke to a broader market.
Peyton Jenkins, one of the two founders of Manhattan-based Alton Lane, says a well-fitting suit is a business
necessity. With the air of old-world Southern charm, the Flatiron district showroom offers shots of bourbon to
visitors, along with the more contemporary option to step into a 3D body scanner. "Our customers want to
look the part at work and they're concerned with finding clothes that fit," Mr. Jenkins said. "It used to be that if
you spent too much time putting yourself together, eyebrows would be raised. Now it has gone the other way
-- if you don't make an effort, it's a reflection of how you take care of yourself." Mr. Jenkins and his partner
Colin Hunter saw an opportunity in the market for the man who doesn't want to drop thousands of dollars at a
department store but still wants a tailored suit. By keeping costs low -- taking body measurements with the
scanner, manufacturing in Thailand, marketing online and maintaining minimum mark-ups -- Alton Lane offers
bespoke shirts at $150 and suits at $485. And the business is growing: Last year, Alton Lane turned over $1
million in orders, much of it from repeat online customers.
Yet as fast as menswear moves toward computer imaging and overseas production, other designers remain
rooted in the tradition of creating high-cost, low-volume wares with a greater emphasis on individuality and
artistry. "We've seen a determined swing back to tailored clothes and a more grown-up style of dressing,"
observed Patrick Grant, owner of the Savile Row tailor Norton & Sons and the off-the-peg line E. Tautz.
"People seem fed-up with dressing casually, and they're discovering the joys of putting on well-made

--- Page 121 ---

clothes." E. Tautz was started essentially from scratch (it had once been a sporting tailor founded in the
1860s), but Norton & Sons was a venerable Savile Row tailor about to go out of business when Mr. Grant,
now 38, raised capital through the sale of his own house to acquire and revive the business. After barely four
years, the former material science graduate has turned Norton & Sons into a highly-starred name in British
bespoke tailoring that produces around 250 suits a year at $5,000 a piece. His clients include everyone from
European aristocracy to British fashion designers and models. "People want the simplest most understated
clothes they can imagine, beautifully cut and fitted with no hint of flamboyance at all," Mr. Grant explained.
"Cloth and execution are key." It's an ideal, he says, that dates back to Beau Brummell, the British dandy of
the Regency period who made the modern suit and tie fashionable for men. Although he advocated polishing
his boots with Champagne he maintained (without apparent contradiction) that men should be unremarkably
dressed.
Johnson & Johnson heir Jamie Johnson and Ralph Lauren's nephew Greg Lauren have entered the
menswear market with designs that echo or play on their backgrounds. Neither Mr. Johnson's rakish living
jackets and dressing-gowns nor Mr. Lauren's re-interpretation of his uncle's brand of style iconography will
likely make it to a mall near you, and neither come cheap. Mr. Johnson's Black Sweater line (named for the
legend of a hostess on Florida's Jupiter Island who would place a black sweater on the porch of any visitor
she disapproved of) is stocked at Bergdorf Goodman; while Mr. Lauren's one-of-a-kind deconstructed
tuxedos and field jackets made from vintage military duffels, army tents and sailor uniforms are at Barneys in
New York. "We've been trained to wear clothes with a certain kind of strong macho aesthetic," Mr. Lauren
explained. "I wanted to ask, 'Are you man enough to wear a pleated, falling-apart tuxedo?' " Mr. Lauren, who
was an artist before he launched his eponymous line, first learned to sew cutting life-size tuxedos and
three-piece suits out of paper for an exhibition he did in Los Angeles titled "Alteration," which explored the
construction of iconic menswear garments.
Mr. Johnson, who has made several documentaries about American aristocratic life including "Born Rich,"
references specific aspects of luxury living. His tan-and-black reversible dressing gown, he hopes, evokes a
sense of the good life; the slightly over-length raincoats and jackets resemble equestrian tailoring. "I find the
idiosyncracies of upper-class life amusing and I want to incorporate and comment on that through clothing,"
he said. "Everybody's saying something in the clothes they choose to wear so I guess I'm joining that
tradition."
Mr. Lauren and Mr. Johnson's forays into fashion speak to a menswear market that outperformed other areas
of the garment industry in the last three months of 2010. That could be women buying their menfolk
Christmas presents, or it may point to an evolution in the way men shop and deport themselves. Later this
month, Natalie Massenet, founder of the shopping website Net-a-Porter, will launch the much buzzed about
Mr. Porter, an e-commerce destination specializing in traditional men's clothes and accessories, which will not
feature runway images as it's sister site does. It's a smart (and deliberate) strategy -- after all, most men are
reluctant shoppers and tend to shy away from what's new. "That's okay for E. Tautz," said Mr. Norton, who's
brand is sold on the site. "But it wouldn't work for Norton & Sons. We like to have a conversation with each
customer, try to understand his lifestyle and build a wardrobe for him. But we don't design the suits.
Essentially you do."

Earnings: Rio Tinto Nearly Triples Net

SYDNEY -- Rio Tinto PLC said it nearly tripled its annual net profit Thursday and that it will have a $5 billion
share buyback, but the mining giant's dramatic return to form was tempered with a warning about a world
economy that is emerging from the financial crisis.
Net profit at Rio Tinto, the world's third-biggest miner by production, grew to $14.32 billion in 2010 from $4.87
billion the previous year after record iron-ore prices, but Chief Executive Tom Albanese said emerging
markets may struggle to keep control of their economies, while developed governments could make missteps
as they pull back from emergency measures imposed during the global financial crisis.
The strong figures are a return to form for Rio Tinto following the company's $44 billion takeover of Alcan Inc.,
which left it struggling under a mountain of debt on the eve of the financial crisis and facing a takeover offer
from larger rival BHP Billiton.
"GDP growth in emerging markets and supply constraints mean the general market and pricing outlook for
commodities remain positive, albeit with elevated risk," Mr. Albanese said in a statement.
"In particular, the timing and speed at which post-global financial crisis stimulus packages are removed have
the potential to generate both volatility and substantial swings in commodity prices."
China's central bank on Tuesday raised lending and deposit rates by 0.25 percentage point as part of efforts
to cool its economy and tame inflation. Analysts are expecting China -- the world's largest steelmaker -- to
tighten monetary policy even further over the year ahead, while India, Brazil and even the U.K. are also
facing pressure to raise interest rates.
Booming commodities prices over the past year helped Rio Tinto pay down debt, invest heavily in expansion
projects and promise a return of cash to shareholders, with management committing $5 billion to a share
buyback by the end of 2012.
Copper, iron ore, tin and gold are all close to records, while silver and palladium are at multi-decade highs.
Aluminum, nickel, platinum and coal have risen to their highest levels since the global financial crisis.
Iron ore accounts for roughly two-thirds of the company's net profit after tax, with copper the second-biggest
driver, accounting for one-sixth of profits.
However, the company sounded a note of caution over the medium-term outlook. Its $5 billion share buyback
was less than the figure of as much as $15 billon tipped by analysts and underlined its reluctance to pursue
large acquisitions following its takeover of Alcan.
The share buyback comes at a time when shareholders have been pressuring mining companies to start
giving back some of their returns from record commodity prices.
Rio Tinto Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott said he had "never heard anything like" the $15 billion figure from
shareholders but said Rio had to continue to conserve cash due to the uncertain economic environment.
"We do want a prudent balance sheet because the outlook is volatile," he said. The firm is keen to pursue a
single-A credit rating from rating agency Standard & Poor's, which would match a similar rating from Moody's
and lower its borrowing costs.
Rio also declared a final dividend of $1.08, compared with 45 cents the previous year. Xstrata PLC on
Tuesday tripled its dividend, while BHP Billiton Ltd.'s largest shareholder Blackrock Inc. has repeatedly
pressed the miner to increase its cash payouts.

--- Page 123 ---
Page 123 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Cash flow grew by 70% over the year, coming to $23.53 billion, compared with $13.83 billion the previous
year. That helped reduce net debt to $4.3 billion, compared with $12 billion at June 30 last year.
On the underlying basis preferred by equity analysts, net profit came to $13.99 billion in the year ended Dec.
31, compared with the previous year's $6.29 billion. Underlying net profit strips out one-off items and
accounting and tax adjustments that can distort the true picture of a company's performance.
The median of analyst estimates for underlying net profit was $14.1 billion, with forecasts ranging from $12.1
billion to $15.1 billion, according to Merrill Lynch.
Since its half-year results last year, Rio Tinto has announced aggressive plans to build up its operations and
in-the-ground resources world-wide, with plans to spend $12 billion by the end of 2011 to shore up its position
in the global iron-ore market. Around $8.1 billion has been dedicated to the iron-rich Pilbara region of
Western Australia alone, with plans to increase output in the region to 333 million tons in 2015 from 185
million tons last year.
Mr. Albanese warned that no miner should be too dependent on any one commodity. "We certainly are
benefiting from record iron-ore production at a time of record iron ore prices, but these aren't necessarily
permanent situations," he said.
"Look back 10 years and ask what were the most uniformly bearish commodities on a consensus basis, and
they would be the ones that are most uniformly bullish today."

NEW YORK -- Oil futures edged lower as fears of supply disruptions at the Suez Canal eased, while the U.S.
benchmark oil contract traded at a record discount to its European counterpart.
Light, sweet crude for March delivery settled down 54 cents, or 0.6%, at $86.94 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The contract settled at a discount of $12.98 to Brent crude, which ended higher on the
ICE futures exchange.
Nymex crude earlier jumped to an intraday high of $88.11 a barrel after an unconfirmed report, originating
from an Egypt-based website, that some workers affiliated with the Suez Canal had begun a sit-in. However,
several shipping companies said operations at the canal, a major energy-transit point, continue to operate
normally, and crude prices later gave up their gains.
Nymex crude's discount to the Brent contract widened to a record level of $13.05 during intraday trading.
Concerns persist that inventory data due this week would show another increase in oil stockpiles at the
Nymex delivery point of Cushing, Okla.
Typically, the two contracts trade within $2 of each other, but rising inventories at Cushing have kept the price
difference, known as the "spread," at unusually wide levels for more than a month. The magnitude of the
spread has caused some market participants to question the Nymex contract's usefulness as a gauge of
global supply and demand for oil.
Unlike the Nymex contract, the Brent contract isn't tied to supply levels at a single location. Brent crude
settled 67 cents, or 0.7%, higher at $99.92 a barrel.
"It's never been this high and never for this long," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, of the
price gap.
Nymex futures also were pressured by the Chinese central bank's decision to raise two key interest rates.
Worries that Beijing's efforts to cool its economy will crimp demand for commodities initially sent most prices
lower, but a weaker dollar later boosted copper to a settlement roughly unchanged from Monday. Gold
futures finished at nearly a three-week high as the interest-rate increase underscored global inflation fears.

Ensco PLC agreed to buy Pride International Inc. for $7.3 billion in cash and stock, in a transaction that would
accelerate the reshaping of the offshore oil-drilling industry nearly a year after BP PLC's disastrous spill in the
Gulf of Mexico.
The two companies said Monday the deal would give Pride shareholders 0.4778 of a share in London-based
Ensco plus $15.60 in cash for each Pride share they hold. That equates to $41.60 a share, or a 21% premium
to Pride's closing price Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The deal, which requires shareholder approval, will close as soon as next quarter, the companies said.
In 4 p.m. composite trading on the Big Board Monday, Pride shares were up 16% at $39.80.
The deal would create the world's second-largest offshore driller, after Transocean Ltd., with 74 rigs in some
of the world's most prolific oil basins. More than a quarter of them would be deepwater rigs capable of drilling
in depths of 4,500 feet or more. Such rigs are in short supply, and command the highest rates in the industry.
Pride had been exploring a sale of the Houston-based company since late last year, and held talks with a
number of possible suitors, including Seadrill Ltd., the big Norwegian drilling contractor. Seadrill owns a
roughly 9% stake in Pride after an abortive attempt to buy the whole company in 2008. People familiar with
the matter said in November that Seadrill had gotten fed up with the minority stake and either wanted to buy
the rest of Pride or cash out.
Seadrill reacted coolly to the terms of Pride's deal with Ensco. "It's an interesting offer, but it's too early to
draw conclusions," said Esa Ikaheimonen, Seadrill's chief financial officer. "For the moment, we're keeping
our options open."
Pride is well established in Brazil and West Africa, the two fastest-growing deepwater markets, while Ensco
has a big presence in the North Sea, Southeast Asia, North America and the Middle East.
In a statement, Ensco Chairman and Chief Executive Dan Rabun, who will hold the same roles at the
combined company, called the tie-up an "ideal strategic fit, as our rig types, markets, customers and expertise
complement each other with minimal overlap."
The deal would leave current Pride stockholders with about 38% of Ensco's equity. Ensco's eight directors
would stay in place and be joined by two Pride directors.
The offshore drilling industry has come under pressure since the Deepwater Horizon disaster, when a drilling
rig leased by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 men and setting off the worst offshore oil spill in
U.S. history.
New, tighter regulations in the U.S. are expected to benefit companies with modern fleets of deepwater rigs,
like Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon, Pride and Seadrill. The regulations also could make it
harder for smaller drilling contractors to compete.
Since the spill, energy-exploration companies have favored the newest drilling rigs with the strongest blowout
preventers. Industry officials say executives who contract these rigs, which can fetch rates as high as
$400,000 a day, are willing to pay more for those with the most up-to-date equipment.
The Ensco-Pride deal follows a string of smaller transactions over the past year or so. Last year, Seadrill
acquired Scorpion Offshore Ltd., Noble Corp. bought Frontier Drilling and Rowan Cos. snapped up Norway's
Skeie Drilling. But the Ensco-Pride tie-up is the industry's largest since Transocean acquired GlobalSantaFe
Corp. in 2007.

J.P. Morgan Will Accept Gold as Type Of Collateral
J.P. Morgan Will Accept Gold as Type Of Collateral

Gold hasn't reinvented itself as a currency yet. But it is getting closer.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said it will allow clients to use the metal as collateral in some transactions. For
example, a hedge fund wanting to borrow money for a short period can put up gold as collateral and use the
borrowings to invest elsewhere, betting on making a better return. Typically, banks accept only Treasury
bonds and stocks in such agreements.
By making the announcement, J.P. Morgan is effectively saying gold is as rock solid an investment as
triple-A-rated Treasurys, adding to a movement that places gold at the top tier of asset classes. It also is
trying to capitalize on all the gold now owned by hedge funds and private investors that is sitting idle in
warehouses.
"It's solidifying a trend that gold is re-establishing its role as a monetary and financial asset," said Carlos
Sanchez, associate director of research with New York commodities consultancy CPM Group.
J.P. Morgan said it is responding to demand from clients, many of which also store gold in the bank's vaults.
"Many clients are holding gold on their balance sheets as an inflation hedge and are looking to make these
assets work for them as collateral," said John Rivett, collateral-management executive at J.P. Morgan
Worldwide Securities Services.
J.P. Morgan's decision Monday reignited debate among gold's fans and detractors. For decades, supporters
have argued gold is a monetary asset and should be treated on an equal footing with cash. However, gold
critics argued the market has been too volatile and too small for it to be considered a legitimate currency.
Recently, though, gold's status has been rising.
Exchanges in New York, Chicago and Europe recently agreed to accept gold as collateral for certain trades.
And the World Gold Council also is gaining traction in its push to have the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision accept the precious metal as a Tier-1 asset for banks, along with government bonds and
currencies.
In India, many financial-services companies are offering personal loans against physical gold, a market that
is expanding.
"Gold is increasingly being used as collateral around the world," said Natalie Dempster, the gold council's
director of government affairs. "All these moves reflect a growing recognition of gold's role as a high-quality,
liquid asset."
Gold futures for February delivery on Monday settled 70 cents lower, or 0.1%, at $1,347.60 a troy ounce on
the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. It reached a nominal record close on Jan. 3 of
$1,422.60.
In essence, J.P. Morgan is creating another role for gold, which has limited use now. One of the main
laments of the metal's critics is that, once bought, the metal doesn't generate any income, compared with
interest on bonds or dividends on stocks, and mainly just sits in vaults, rising and falling in value.
"It gives another use to gold as a cash instrument," said Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global, a
commodities brokerage. Investors who hold gold, he said, "might be less likely to sell it."
Gold still is far from being the integral part of the monetary system it once was.

After World War II, under the Bretton Woods agreement, several countries pegged their currencies to the
dollar, which in turn was fixed to the price of gold. President Richard Nixon ended the dollar-gold peg in
1971.
It is unclear whether customers need to hand over the physical bullion to J.P. Morgan or at what haircut the
metal will be pledged with the bank.
There still is risk for financial institutions in taking gold as collateral.
If prices fall sharply, along with the value of the underlying trades, the collateral value could fall short of
covering the trading positions, leaving banks scrambling for more margin to cover the losses.
In the past, worries about a lack of liquidity in the gold market have prevented banks from taking gold as
collateral. But as investors piled into the market in recent years, the market has deepened.
The market is more liquid than many government-bond markets in Europe, with daily trading volumes
normally exceeding $100 billion, according to the World Gold Council.
"When a bank, such as J.P. Morgan, is willing to extend collateral value against an asset such as physical
bullion, it shows that they are not worried about the liquidity issue if they might take the collateral over or they
have to liquidate the collateral," said Frank McGhee, head precious metals trader at Integrated Brokerage
Services, a Chicago broker.

Investing in Funds: A Monthly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: Some ETFs Boom by Getting
Physical --- Funds holding gold bullion are popular; But there are challenges to investing directly in
other metals and commodities

The investing hordes are going in for hoarding, a concept that has appealed to military strategists, legendary
value investor Benjamin Graham and squirrels.
But as fund companies create more products that stockpile raw materials, emerging challenges suggest the
idea may come up short as an investment strategy.
Since 2004, investors have socked billions into U.S. exchange-traded funds backed by raw materials rather
than by the usual futures contracts or other paper proxies for physical commodities. As investors buy shares
in the funds, the funds typically acquire more material. The value of the shares rises and falls with the actual
commodity.
Thus far, these "physically backed" funds have focused largely on precious metals -- the largest holds gold,
but others hold silver, platinum and palladium -- and have appealed to investors who have a "greater degree
of comfort" with hard assets than stocks, bonds, futures or the like, says Graham Tuckwell, head of ETF
Securities, which runs physically backed funds.
As of the end of last year, nine physically backed U.S.-based ETFs together had amassed $77.6 billion of
assets, according to fund-tracking firm IndexUniverse.com, compared with $24 billion for futures-backed
commodity ETFs.
Physically backed funds are attractive to some because they avoid a problem with futures-based
commodities investing that has hurt returns -- the expense of selling expiring monthly contracts and then
buying new ones. The impact can be large because new contracts frequently have been more expensive in
recent years -- a phenomenon known as contango that reflects both the carrying costs and expectations of
future supply and demand.
By holding the actual goods, the physically backed funds can sidestep the contango and sidle closer to what
many investors want -- returns that move in tandem with price changes in the underlying material.
Fund operators now are trying to expand beyond precious metals. Firms such as ETF Securities and J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co. are launching similar products to hold industrial metals, such as copper and lead. But
that's where things start to get tricky, and the reasons help explain the potential limits associated with
hoarding.
Precious-metals funds often have low fees because those materials are compact and relatively inexpensive
to store. That makes it easy for fund returns to closely track underlying prices.
Stockpiling bulkier materials is more expensive. The storage fee for ETF Securities' copper fund is 1.56%,
roughly four times the total 0.40% fee for SPDR Gold Shares, known by the ticker symbol GLD, the largest
physically backed ETF.
"It costs real money to store copper," says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse.com. By
comparison, he says, "all the gold in GLD would fit in [a] hotel room." As of mid-January, the World Gold
Council, which sponsors GLD, said the bullion held by the ETF would form a cube slightly more than 13 feet
per side.
That also helps explain why there are as yet no similar funds backed by actual crude oil or corn in silos. The
storage would probably be even more expensive, and there could be additional complications that would
curtail returns. "Oil leaks. Mice eat corn," says Mr. Hougan.

--- Page 130 ---
Page 130 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Such funds also could prove controversial. According to Mr. Tuckwell, a fund backed by grain is "not
necessarily a good social product," and stockpiling food on behalf of investors is "more open to political
commentary."
Any such commentary likely would revolve around the impact on prices. Many observers agree that physically
backed funds can make the raw materials they buy more expensive by providing an outlet for pent-up
demand from retail investors, who can't stockpile commodities on their own. It's hard to determine exactly
how big the price impact is, but the influence has stirred opposition.
In February 2006, when silver cost less than $10 a troy ounce, an executive at a U.S. unit of Fujifilm Holdings
Corp. wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying a fund backed by silver, a key component of
photographic film, would "mean higher product costs and lost jobs in our industry."
The SEC nonetheless gave the fund the green light. Silver prices shot up, then pulled back, but ended that
year just under $13, a sizable premium to the pre-fund price. In later years, silver prices fluctuated, but rose
sharply in 2010 and recently hovered below $30. In December, Fujifilm said prices for photographic paper
would rise about 10% early this year, and cited higher costs for raw materials.
On the other hand, stockpiles of some raw materials have long been used to guard against price shocks. The
U.S. established the Strategic Petroleum Reserve after the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. It now holds
enough crude oil to meet domestic demand for more than a month.
Amid the Great Depression, Mr. Graham, mentor to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, touted the notion of
using a stockpile of commodities to underpin paper money, in a 1937 book titled "Storage and Stability, A
Modern Ever-normal Granary." At the time, the world still operated on the gold standard. But Mr. Graham
argued that "storage of basic commodities suggests itself as the most suitable backing for a sound and
adequate currency," and added that storage "is vested with the allied function of reasonably stabilizing price
levels."
When it comes to industrial metals, Mr. Tuckwell says commodity-backed ETFs could act as "an extra safety
valve" to curb soaring prices. Investors in such funds would notice a price spike, and "that's when they'd be
unloading it," he says.
One possible reason: Investors often view precious metals as a safe-haven investment, but they might be
more willing to part with industrial metals, which society tends to view as materials that are meant to be
consumed.
Still, Mr. Tuckwell says he has modest expectations for his firm's new funds, which will buy copper, nickel, tin,
lead and zinc. He cites storage costs as one of the reasons. "I don't expect just huge amounts of money piling
into it," he says.

Forex View: Dollar May Tap Safe-Haven Bid from Egypt Upheaval

Uncertainty about the outcome of Egypt's crisis may again loom large in currency markets this week, buffeting
the euro and other riskier currencies and bolstering the dollar.
While such traditional safe havens as the Swiss franc and gold have intermittently gained from investors'
concerns that social unrest could spread across the Middle East, the U.S. currency has also benefited.
Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington, D.C., said the
headline-grabbing Egyptian turmoil should continue to give the dollar a safe-haven edge.
But others say the euro should escape any serious dents from Egypt's troubles. Indeed, the common
currency for 17 European nations again test $1.39, as investors' renewed appetite for risk raises commodities
and equities and puts pressure on the dollar, said Michael Woolfolk, a strategist at BNY Mellon.
Sunday, as central Cairo's Tahrir Square filled for a 13th day of protests, Egyptian Vice President Omar
Suleiman met representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood, an organization the government has spent years
suppressing. But none of the other parties or youth movements that have driven the demonstrations
attended, underscoring the uncertainty over how the crisis will play out.
Any gains for the dollar from the crisis may be muted because of questions about the pace of U.S. economic
recovery. Friday's U.S. payrolls data showed a mixed employment picture.
Unusually bad weather that kept many workers home made the jobs data difficult for traders to interpret. That
sparked some debate about whether the dollar should be treated more as a safe-haven currency, given the
political crisis in Egypt, or as a riskier play given the financial woes of many U.S. state governments.
The U.S. jobs data could be "bad for the dollar" against the euro and the yen this week, given that they didn't
come down clearly on the side of strong economic growth, said Morgan Stanley currency strategist Ron
Leven.
While the unemployment rate fell sharply, confounding expectations for a small rise, the increase in the
number of nonfarm jobs on the nation's payrolls was much smaller than expected. Analysts attributed much of
that to the heavy snowfall that blanketed much of U.S. last month and kept potential employees in
hibernation.
Meanwhile, attention among Asian currencies is likely to focus once again on the yuan as the Lunar New
Year holidays end.
With no major data releases expected in the U.S. this week, traders will be watching for China's January
trade data, Analysts expect the figures to show that exports continued to rise while imports grew at a slower
pace compared to December. That could signal that China's economy is cooling; a potential warning sign for
the global economic outlook.
"If you see the China trade situation deteriorate, it could be a slight negative for the dollar," Commonwealth
Foreign Exchange's Mr. Esiner said.
Chinese markets reopen Wednesday after being shuttered for a week because of the holidays. Morgan
Stanley's Mr. Leven said he expects the tightly controlled yuan to "start crawling again" as Beijing allows it to
move in line with an appreciation rate of about 6% for the year. That could affect other commodity currencies,
which are often correlated to China's because of the country's vital importance as a buyer of commodities
world-wide, he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury on Friday declined to name China or any other country as a manipulator of its
currency in the Treasury's much-awaited report on foreign-exchange policies. That eased worries, for now,
that Washington might turn the yuan's exchange rate into a contentious political issue, but trade tensions
between the two countries over the artificially weak Chinese currency are unlikely to abate any time soon.
Last week was a good one for the dollar: It gained on the euro for the ninth week in the past 13, and it
snapped a three-week losing streak on the yen.
Friday, the euro weakened to $1.3590 from $1.3635 late Thursday. The dollar strengthened to 82.20 yen
from 81.57 yen. The euro moved to 111.71 yen from 111.22 yen. The U.K. pound weakened to $1.6097 from
$1.6144. The dollar leapt to 0.9547 Swiss franc from 0.9454 franc.
The Australian dollar will be in focus as traders digest retail sales and labor-market data. The economy has
been hit hard recently by first floods and then a major cyclone that destroyed crops in Queensland.

Inflation, long a sleeping giant, is finally awakening. And that could present problems -- along with
opportunities -- for investors.
A quick glance at the overall inflation numbers might suggest there is little reason to worry. The most recent
U.S. Consumer Price Index was up just 1.5% over the past year. Not only was that lower than the historical
average of about 3%, but it was uncomfortably low for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who prefers
to see inflation at about 2%.
Yet it is a much different situation overseas, particularly in the developing world. In South Korea, the CPI rose
at a 4.1% clip in January from a year earlier, higher than the 3.8% estimate. In Brazil, analysts expect prices
to rise 5.6% this year, exceeding the central-bank target of 4.5%. China, meanwhile, has been boosting
interest rates and raising bank capital requirements to keep inflation, which rose to 4.6% in December, in
check.
"Emerging market economies are overheating," says Julia Coronado, chief economist for North America at
BNP Paribas in New York. "They need to slow growth or inflation will become destabilizing."
Even some developed economies are seeing rising prices. Inflation in the U.K. surged to 3.7% in December,
while the euro zone's rate climbed to 2.4% in January, the fastest rise since 2008.
Much of the uptick has been driven by commodity prices. During the past six months, oil has jumped 9%,
copper has gained 36% and silver has shot up 56%. Agricultural products have soared as well: Cotton, wheat
and soybeans have risen 100%, 24% and 42%, respectively. That's a problem because rising input prices
"work their way down the food chain to CPI," says Alan Ruskin, global head of G-10 foreign-exchange
strategy at Deutsche Bank.
Of course, the main inflation driver is usually wages -- and that isn't a factor in the U.S., where high
unemployment has kept a lid on pay for three years.
Yet there isn't a historical blueprint for the inflation scenario that seems to be unfolding now. Not only has the
global economy changed drastically since the last big inflationary run during the 1970s, but the lingering
effects of the recent debt crisis remain a wild card.
For investors, that means traditional inflation busters such as real estate and gold might not work as
expected, while other strategies might perform better.
So how should you position your portfolio? The best approach, say advisers, is to tweak asset allocations
rather than overhaul them. That involves dialing back on some kinds of bonds, stocks and commodities and
increasing holdings of others. Here's a guide:
What to Sell
-- Bonds. The price of a bond moves in the opposite direction of its yield. When inflation kicks up, interest
rates usually move higher, pressuring bond prices. Even buy-and-hold investors get hurt, because higher
inflation erodes the real value of the interest payments you receive and the principal you get back when the
bond matures.
The drop is usually most extreme in longer-dated bonds, because low yields are locked in for a longer period
of time. So inflation-wary investors should shorten the maturities of their bonds, say advisers.

The safest bonds, especially Treasurys, are usually hardest hit, because those are the most influenced by
changes in rates -- unlike corporate bonds, whose prices also move based on credit quality. From September
1986 through September 1987, for example, as inflation moved higher, Treasurys dropped 1.2%.
It might even make sense to dial back on Treasury inflation-protected securities, whose principal and interest
payments grow alongside the CPI. That's because investors already have flooded into TIPS, driving up prices
and driving down the real, inflation-adjusted yields. A typical 10-year TIPS, for example, yields just 1.1%
after inflation, compared with an average of more than 2% in recent years.
With so little cushion, long-term TIPS carry a higher risk of loss for investors who are forced to sell before the
bonds mature. "Even if inflation is rising, you can still lose money," says Joseph Shatz, interest-rate
strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
-- Hard assets. Real estate may be a classic inflation hedge, but it seems likely to disappoint investors this
time around. Even though rising inflation should put upward pressure on home prices, the twin forces of
record-high foreclosures and consumers reducing their debt loads are expected to mute price gains for
several years, says Milton Ezrati, senior economist at asset manager Lord Abbett. That's a far cry from the
1970s, when the median home price rose 43%, according to U.S. Census data.
Gold is another traditional inflation hedge that might be less effective now. With prices already having more
than quadrupled over the past nine years, many strategists see substantial inflation already factored into the
price.
Historically, gold has moved with the money supply. During the last 30 years, the correlation has been about
69%, according to FactSet data. (A correlation of 100% means two indexes move in lockstep all the time; a
correlation of minus-100% means they move in perfect opposition.) Based on the money supply alone, gold
is priced 25% above where it should be, says Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc.'s
iShares.
-- Stocks. Equities can be a decent hedge against creeping inflation, because companies are better able to
pass off costs to customers. But when input costs suddenly jump, profit margins take a hit.
At the same time, the higher interest rates that accompany inflation prompt investors to demand more
profits for each dollar invested. As a result, price/earnings ratios tend to shrivel. Over the past 55 years, the
average trailing P/E ratio of a stock in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen to 16.95 during
periods with inflation running between 3% and 5%, from 19.24 during periods with inflation of 1% to 3%, the
most common inflation range since 1955, Mr. Koesterich says.
Sectors that are sensitive to interest rates, including financials, utility stocks and consumer staples, are
especially vulnerable, say advisers.
What to Buy
-- Cash and bank products. Money-market mutual funds are more attractive in inflationary environments
because the funds invest in short-term securities that mature every 30 to 40 days, and therefore can pass
through higher rates quickly. In an extreme example, money-funds posted yields over 15% during the
inflation-ravaged 1970s and early 1980s, says Pete Crane of Crane Data, which tracks money funds.
A growing number of inflation-linked savings products are cropping up as well. Incapital LLC, a Chicago
investment bank, says it has seen a pickup recently in issuances of certificates of deposit designed for a
rising-rate environment. Savers, for example, can invest in a 12-year CD whose rate starts at 3% then
gradually steps up to 4.25% starting in 2015, and peaks at 5.5% starting at 2019 until the CD's maturity in
2023.
A caveat: If inflation eases and rates fall, investors could get burned, since the issuer may call the CDs and
investors would lose out on the higher rates at maturity.
-- Bonds. One way to reduce the impact of rising inflation on bond holdings is to build a bond ladder --
buying bonds that mature in, say, two, four, six, eight and 10 years. As the shorter-term bonds mature,
investors can reinvest the proceeds into longer-term bonds at higher rates.
"A bond ladder is best for someone who doesn't mind holding them for up to 10 years," says Jeff Feldman, an
adviser in Rochester, N.Y.
Highly cautious investors might prefer the I Bond, a U.S. savings bond that earns interest based on a
twice-yearly CPI adjustment. Although the current yield on I Bonds is only 0.74%, that yield is likely to move
higher on May 1, the next time the rate is adjusted. I Bonds aren't as volatile as TIPS and appeal to

conservative, buy-and-hold investors. The interest may also be tax-free for some families for education
expenses.
More adventurous types might consider the inflation-protected government debt of other nations, which carry
higher yields along with greater risks. The SPDR DB International Government Inflation-Protected Bond
Fund is an international inflation-protected bond exchange-traded fund designed to do well if inflation in
overseas countries moves higher. The fund returned about 6.8% in 2010 and 18.5% in 2009, according to
Morningstar Inc.
-- Bank-loan funds. Another way to exploit rising inflation is through mutual funds that buy adjustable-rate
bank loans, many of which are used to finance leveraged corporate buyouts. So-called floating-rate funds are
structured so that if interest rates rise, they collect more money. During periods of rising rates, floating-rate
funds usually outperform other bond-fund categories. In 2003, for example, as investors anticipated higher
interest rates and a stronger economy, bank-loan funds gained 10.4% while short-term bond funds gained
2.5%.
Now, amid expectations of rising inflation, investors are once again flocking to these funds, pouring in about
$7.6 billion into loan funds in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Lipper Inc. -- more than double the
previous quarterly record set in 2007. The pace has accelerated this year, with investors putting in about $3.4
billion thus far.
After gaining almost 10% last year, the funds shouldn't be counted on for much price appreciation, says Craig
Russ, who co-manages $22.7 billion of floating-rate investments across three floating-rate funds and other
accounts at Eaton Vance Corp., including the Eaton Vance Floating Rate Fund. But the funds generate plenty
of income, yielding about 4% to 5% now, according to Morningstar.
Be warned: Floating-rate funds can get creamed when investors fear the underlying loans are too risky. In
2008, for example, bank-loan funds lost 29.7%, although they zoomed 41.8% in 2009, according to
Morningstar. What's more, banks are beginning to make riskier "covenant-light" loans that carry fewer
stipulations for corporate borrowers -- a sign of frothier trends in the market.
Given the potential for big swings, floating-rate funds are best viewed as a complement to -- not a
replacement for -- investors' core bond holdings. Among Morningstar's picks in this category is the Fidelity
Floating Rate High-Income Fund, among the more conservative in the category.
-- Commodities. Materials that are more closely tied to industrial or food production seem better positioned
now than gold, say advisers. The trick is to find the best investment vehicle.
The easiest way for small investors to gain exposure to most commodities is through exchange-traded funds,
many of which use futures contracts. But such funds can be dangerous because they often face "contango" --
when the price for a future delivery is higher than the current price. The result: The ETFs lose money as they
buy new contracts, even when prices are rising.
The losses can be extreme. In 2009, for instance, while the price of natural gas rose 3.4%, the United States
Natural Gas Fund lost 56.5% as a result of rolling over futures contracts.
Some firms have rolled out ETFs that aim to address the problem. One of Morningstar's picks is the U.S.
Commodity Index Fund, run by U.S. Commodity Funds LLC. The portfolio buys the seven commodities that
are most "backwardated" -- the opposite of "contango," so rolling contracts should result in a profit -- along
with the seven commodities with the most price momentum.
"USCI provides an outlet for investors who want broad commodities exposure but don't want to worry about
the daily dynamics," says Tim Strauts, a Morningstar analyst.
Other funds play inflation by holding many different assets to protect against rising prices no matter where
they show up. The IQ Real Return ETF, launched in 2009 by IndexIQ, aims to provide a return equal to the
CPI plus 2% to 3% over a two- to three-year period. To get there, it invests across a dozen or so
inflation-sensitive assets -- including currencies and commodities.
-- Stocks. One corner of the market tends to do better when prices rise suddenly: small-company value
stocks. "Because value and small stocks tend to be fairly highly [indebted] companies, inflation reduces their
liabilities," says William Bernstein of Efficient Frontier Advisors LLC, an investment-advisory firm in Eastford,
Conn.
From January 1965 through December 1980, for example, inflation averaged 6.6% a year. The Ibbotson
Small-Cap Value Index posted average annual returns of 14.4%, according to Morningstar's Ibbotson
Associates, double the S&P 500's 7.1% gain.

--- Page 136 ---

Morningstar's picks in the small-cap value fund category include Allianz NFJ Small Cap Value, Diamond Hill
Small Cap, Perkins Small Cap Value and Schneider Small Cap Value. Just be warned: Small value stocks
have had a good run recently, returning 134%, on average, since March 6, 2009.
In the end, the particulars of any inflation-fighting plan may not be as important as developing a plan in the
first place.
"The real problem you run into with any kind of inflation hedges," says Jay Hutchins, a financial adviser in
Lebanon, N.H., "is that if you don't already have them when inflation is around the corner, you've missed the
boat."

Unrest Pits Oil Bulls Vs. Gold bugs

Unrest Pits Oil Bulls Vs. Gold bugs

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
When the Middle East roars, so do oil bulls. But buying gold could be a better hedge against Egyptian
turmoil.
On its own, the threat to oil markets from further unrest in Egypt is minimal. Egypt isn't a net exporter of oil,
and less than 2% of the world's traded crude transits the Suez Canal. For that, we can thank the 1956 Suez
crisis, which spurred the building of supertankers able to ship oil around Africa.
Oil markets would feel it more if unrest spread elsewhere, as this might affect exports, and also spur hoarding
in anticipation of rising prices.
Against that, though, oil inventories are high, one reason why U.S. oil prices trade at big discounts to Brent
crude. And Saudi Arabia's oil minister re-emphasized Monday his country's spare capacity. Saudi Arabia's
willingness to use this helped quickly erase the doubling of oil prices after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
A price spike also could threaten fragile Western economies. China, meanwhile, seeing how inflation has
fueled Egypt's unrest, would have even more reason to crack down on rising prices, potentially curbing
energy demand.
Barring an extreme event like regime change in Saudi Arabia, oil, which has risen sharply already, could
prove a volatile hedge. Gold may make more sense. Apart from its traditional safe haven identity, gold has
become highly negatively correlated with real U.S. interest rates since the financial crisis. Gold stands to
suffer economic recoverygathers pace, as this brings nearer the day rates rise sustainably.
Higher energy prices hurting U.S. consumers actually could provide a rationale for extending lax monetary
policy for longer. In that environment, real gold could trump black gold.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Egypt is sending investors a wake-up call about the risks in emerging markets.
For two years, investors have poured money indiscriminately into emerging-market assets that looked safe
relative to stocks and bonds from debt-laden developed economies. But declines in U.S., Asian and
European stocks and the rally in oil, bonds and gold reflect the risk that Egyptian unrest triggers contagion.
One risk is that the political turmoil spreads. Tunisia and Egypt are reminders of how volatile and
unpredictable emerging markets can be and that this needs to be reflected in their cost of capital. That could
trigger flows of capital out of emerging markets back into developed markets, already buoyed by the brighter
growth outlook for the U.S. Middle Eastern stock markets were hit hard over the weekend, and the cost of
insuring the debt of countries, including Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Lebanon, has risen.
A second possible source of contagion is via the oil price, up 7.6% since Thursday. Investors are worried by
the risk of an extreme event like a closure of the Suez Canal or serious instability in big oil producers like
Libya or Saudi Arabia.
A third risk lies in the response to the high food prices that are a factor behind social tensions in North Africa
and the Middle East. That raises the possibility of policy errors. Monetary-policy makers might tighten too
quickly to stamp on inflation, or governments might try to ease food prices through subsidies, weakening
their fiscal positions.
Contagion will have winners as well as losers. Russia would benefit from higher oil prices; Brazil would gain
from higher agricultural and commodities prices. But even if Egyptian turmoil subsides, a lasting effect should
be greater discrimination between emerging-markets.

The Dow's Rockin' New Year --- Industrial Average Begins 2011 With Its Best January in More Than a Decade

The Dow's Rockin' New Year --- Industrial Average Begins 2011 With Its Best January in More Than a
Decade

Blue-chip stocks kicked off the new year with their strongest January in 14 years, as a boom in corporate
revenues and robust economic readings gave investors confidence that the U.S. economy has turned a
corner.
Helped by the Federal Reserve's open monetary spigot, stocks continued a rally that began in December.
Most of January was dominated by steady gains and few broad shocks, until protests erupted in Egypt last
week.
"It was in like a lamb, and out like a lion," said David Kelly, chief market strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds.
"January was a continuation of the trend we saw late last year -- what's changed is that the economy is
moving from recovery to expansion, and we're seeing a move up in various measures of consumer and
investor confidence."
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 68.23 points, or 0.6%, to close at 11891.93. The Dow's
2.7% gain for the month is the blue-chip index's strongest January since 1997 and the first positive January in
four years. Apart from last Friday's Egypt-related stumble, the Dow didn't shed more than 40 points on any
single day in January -- good news for market watchers who believe a strong January bodes well for the rest
of the year.
Still, several clouds loom on the horizon. For a start, some are worried the tensions in Egypt could spark a
contagion in other markets, setting off a spiral of selling. Others say Europe's troubles are far from over, and
many have their eyes turned to China, where the economy still is red hot. And in the U.S., some are
concerned recent revenue gains may not be enough to offset rising commodity prices, potentially crimping
corporate profits in coming quarters.
The prospect of rising commodity prices and inflation is a nagging worry for stock investors as they head into
February. Energy stocks were by far the strongest performers in January, as crude-oil prices broke above
$90 a barrel for the first time since the credit bubble. On Monday, Brent oil futures that are traded in London
finished above $101 a barrel for the first time since September 2008, and the U.S. benchmark, the West
Texas Intermediate, soared 3.2%.
Uncertainty in the Middle East and the prospect of further gains in oil prices could exacerbate the inflationary
pressures.
"Investors have seen enough evidence that the Middle East can throw a wild card -- it has for four decades,"
said Mr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan. "Investors would be right to be cautious here, and rising oil prices is simply a
reflection of that caution."
For now, many investors remain sanguine.
As the economic picture has improved, gold slid to its worst monthly finish since late 2008, falling as much as
$100 off the record high it notched at the beginning of the month. Gold finished January at $1333.80 an
ounce.
Even a return of European debt worries couldn't stop the Continent from boasting some of the best
performances among global stock indexes. Spain's IBEX 35 index rose 9.6%, while Italy's FTSE MIB index
rose 9.2%. Germany's DAX 30 index and France's CAC-40 index also finished the month just off their
respective 52-week highs.

--- Page 140 ---
Page 140 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
In the U.S., the month's gains were powered by economic improvement and a wave of fourth-quarter
earnings that showed corporate America beating revenue estimates at a level unseen since the recession,
bolstering hopes that the economy has begun to pivot out of recovery and into expansion.
Among Dow members, General Electric, International Business Machines and Exxon Mobil each added 10%
or more after announcing better-than-expected revenue and earnings numbers.
Each of the stocks is now trading at its highest in at least two years.
Still, rising costs, thanks to surging commodity prices, are giving some investors pause.
"Strong revenues are a reflection of a strong economy, and that's good," says Gary Flam, a portfolio manager
at Los Angeles-based Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages $6 billion in assets.
"The warning sign is that, because of rising costs, the revenue beats have not been falling to the bottom
lines," Mr. Flam says.

A Cultural Conversation / With Jaume Plensa: The Man With a Thousand Faces

A Cultural Conversation / With Jaume Plensa: The Man With a Thousand Faces

Chicago -- 'What is art?" the Barcelona and Paris-based sculptor Jaume Plensa asks me over breakfast at a
hotel hard by his monumental and iconic $17 million Crown Fountain in Chicago's Millennium Park. "Art
should be an echo," he continues, "a feeling of your heart . . . a mirror, a container of memory." At his Crown
Fountain, we see aspects of the childhood memories animating Mr. Plensa's work.
"I didn't grow up with art but with books," he says, "including medical books, but I had more of a fantastic than
a scientific interest. I loved the body. In fact I was obsessed by it."
No wonder, then, that the Crown Fountain's central aspect is a dramatic display of heads -- the heads of
1,000 Chicagoans filmed by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (where he teaches courses on public
art). The heads randomly appear on huge LED screens covering two 50-foot-tall glass-block towers that
stand as massive bookends to a shallow black granite pool, fed by water cascading down the towers. At brief
intervals, each head puckers its lips and -- like a modern gargoyle -- spews a stream of water into the pool.
The 1,000 video images that dominate the fountain have inspired much of Mr. Plensa's subsequent work,
including another large video project for later this year in Seoul. This visit to Chicago is only a stopover on his
way to Calgary, Alberta, to oversee the selection of fabricators for his monumental public sculpture of a young
girl's head, planned for 2012.
Mr. Plensa's Calgary project follows from other recent public monuments featuring elongated faces of young
girls. One is "Dream" (2009). Fabricated in a luminescent finish of white marble and concrete aggregate, this
head of a young girl with her eyes closed rises more than 60 feet from the site of the former Sutton Manor
Colliery near Liverpool, England, shimmering above the skyline. His 16-foot-tall "Awilda" (2010), a bust of a
young girl in highly polished white Spanish marble, was unveiled in Salzburg, Austria, in October. Like
"Dream," she appears to spring out of the ground and cast a tranquil aura on her surroundings. Just as
"Dream" is intended to suggest hope for the future on the site of an abandoned coal mine, Mr. Plensa hopes
that the face of "Awilda" "injects an image of the future into the heart of our old traditions."
For his New York public-art debut in Madison Square Park on May 5, he is creating "Echo," a 44-foot-tall
head and face of a 9-year-old girl named for the goddess. "New York has so much movement. I want to do
something that doesn't move at all, but offers a still, quiet place to relax."
As we walk along Michigan Avenue, Mr. Plensa recalls other early memories. "I shopped with my mother in
Barcelona stores where we passed through beaded curtains. I thought the rustling of those curtains made
beautiful music. Also, I love not only great poetry but the physical aspect of text. So I dreamed about
transforming letters into something physical." In "Twenty Nine Palms" (2007), Mr. Plensa sculpted steel letters
of the alphabet and strung them together to hang -- like curtains in the Barcelona shops. The letters make up
selections from some of Mr. Plensa's favorite authors, including Baudelaire, Blake, Allen Ginsberg, Goethe
and Shakespeare. The work was exhibited earlier this year at Dallas's Nasher Sculpture Center. "Everybody
passed through these curtains, and the letters spoke to each other making beautiful music," he told me. "I
dreamed about transforming letters into something physical. Poetry transformed into music."
In his exhibition last fall at New York's Galerie Lelong, he included three sleeping female heads, all lit
internally with white neon and branded on their faces with words taken from "De Profundis," a letter from
Oscar Wilde to his paramour about the travails of prison life.
He uses letters "like cells of information" to create human forms, as in "I, you, she or he . . ." (2006), in the
permanent collection of the Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park in Grand Rapids, Mich. Three
human figures sculpted of letters in stainless steel rest atop boulders, facing one another in what could be a
conversation. For the MIT sesquicentennial in Cambridge, Mass., he installed "The Alchemist," a human torso
more than 10 feet tall consisting of mathematical symbols in stainless steel.

"As a child, when my father played piano, I was small enough to hide myself inside the case at the base of my
family's spinet. I could feel the vibrations," Mr. Plensa tells me. And this feeling of sound figured prominently
in the installation "Jerusalem" (2006), composed of 18 bronze gongs suspended at eye level, part of his
exhibition at the Meijer sculpture park last year. A padded mallet accompanied each gong, and viewers were
encouraged to strike the works. "You feel the vibration, then energy," Mr. Plensa says. For "World Voices"
(2010) in the lobby of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, he crafted 196 cymbals of stainless
steel, brass, bronze and gold. Here, water drips onto the cymbals, creating the interplay between sight and
sound.
Music is also central to the bronze self-portraits, each with arms and legs wrapped around living trees, on
exhibition outside of the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University until the end of this week. Each is
inscribed with a composer's name, including Bartok, Beethoven and Gershwin. "I want people to remember
music as they look at them," Mr. Plensa explains.
"I invite people to touch the materials," Mr. Plensa says of his works. "So many things you have to explore
with your hands. I want people to be engaged, to touch. When you love somebody, you must embrace. When
I spoke in Des Moines . . . I invited people to touch my 'Nomade' [2007], a 26-foot-high stainless-steel figure
fabricated from latticed letters. But a lady told me that a sign said 'Do not touch.' I said to her, 'Then don't
touch the sculpture, caress it.' At my lecture at the Nasher Sculpture Center [in 2009], I said 'I'd love you to
touch the alabaster heads.' Even the guards touched them."
We return to the complexities he confronted with the Crown Fountain. "Crown was one of my most
challenging projects in a public space. It's like a symphony with many elements. The city took amazing risks.
They allowed me and my colleagues to create a technology mixing water, electricity and people."
When engineers announced that the project would cost about $17 million, well beyond what was originally
contemplated by the Crown family, the Crowns asked Mr. Plensa if he could scale it back. "I'm pretty good
with scale," he tells me he answered them. "I can reduce the scale of my piece if you can reduce the scale of
Chicago."
The Crowns supported the fountain on Mr. Plensa's scale. "They understood," he said to me. "We talk a lot
about weight and size, but not about soul. But it's about soul. Soul, not body. For the Crown Fountain, the
body is only the physical elements. The soul equals the faces. That's why you feel comfortable here." With
that, he left for Calgary to continue crafting his next face.

Commodities: Mutual Fund or ETF?
Fund Track
Commodities: Mutual Fund or ETF?
By Sam Mamudi

For all the talk about the success of exchange-traded funds, there is at least one sector where traditional
mutual funds maintain their supremacy: commodities.
Over the past year, commodity mutual funds have proportionally seen roughly five times the net inflows that
commodities ETFs have seen. Over the same period, stock mutual funds saw about three times the net
inflows of stock ETFs on a proportional basis.
One notable exception: the precious-metals subsector, where ETF flows significantly outstrip those of mutual
funds.
Data from fund-tracker Lipper Inc. show that 94 mutual funds in the broad commodities space saw $11 billion
in net inflows; 54 ETFs netted $1 billion.
The 25 precious-metals ETFs have seen close to $8 billion in net inflows; 74 mutual funds have reaped $3.7
billion.
The reason for broad commodity mutual funds' popularity, say professional investors, is largely that similar
commodities ETFs hold futures contracts. This leaves ETFs more prone to so-called contango effects, as well
as vulnerable to tax hits and front-running -- when traders can jump ahead of expected trades to profit from
subsequent demand.
Precious-metals ETFs avoid these problems by directly owning the underlying commodities.
Commodities ETFs usually hold futures contracts because the indexes they track are made up of contracts.
Thus ETFs have fallen victim to contango -- when a longer-term futures contact is more expensive than its
near-term counterpart. This hurts the fund because it means it loses money every time it moves from a
near-month contract to a further-dated contract.
One notable instance was when contango hit U.S. Natural Gas ETF (UNG) in 2009.
Mutual funds, such as Pimco Commodity Real Return Fund (PCRDX), typically gain exposure through debt
instruments such as swaps and prepaid forward notes, rather than futures, and so avoid the worst of these
problems.
Commodities ETFs also can suffer because of transparency -- the rollover dates of their contracts are known
by the market.
"The ETFs are so transparent that they were easily gamed," said James Shelton, chief investment officer of
Houston-based Kanaly Trust, which manages $1.6 billion for clients.
Mr. Shelton said he also prefers commodity mutual funds because many commodities ETFs are fairly new.
"Mutual funds have a better track record of performing across different markets," he said.
James Dailey, chief financial officer of Team Financial Managers, a Harrisburg, Pa.-based investment
adviser, noted that many of the new funds are still gathering assets, so liquidity can be a concern. Mr. Dailey,
whose firm manages more than $125 million, said that because commodities ETFs hold futures they also
have tax liabilities, of both the capital gains and mark-to-market variety.
The lack of futures contracts makes precious-metal ETFs alluring. These funds, including SPDR Gold Trust
(GLD), iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), actually hold the commodities rather than
futures contracts.

Jan. 24-28
U.S.
-- The federal budget deficit will hit a record of nearly $1.5 trillion in 2011 because of the weak economy,
higher spending and fresh tax cuts, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday, in a stark
warning that will drive the growing battle over government spending and taxation. Friday brought better news,
as the Commerce Department estimated annualized economic growth of 3.2% in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued its report, finding that 12 of the 13 largest U.S.
financial institutions "were at risk of failure" at the nadir of the 2008 financial crisis, while at least 50 hedge
funds tried to capitalize on it.
-- Fresh evidence suggested anxious BP staff on the doomed Deepwater Horizon rig voiced concerns to their
bosses. Three days before it exploded, the onshore manager in charge of the rig warned his supervisor that
last-minute procedural changes were creating "chaos," and was urged to tell rig workers "to hang in there."
The supervisor then signed off to attend a dance practice, promising to call later in the day. "We're dancing to
the Village People!" he wrote.
-- Tucson shooting suspect Loughner pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted assassination and attempted
murder of federal employees. Further charges are likely.
---
Politics
-- Obama used his State of the Union address to urge the nation to meet the challenges of a global economy,
framing what he called a competitiveness agenda. It includes infrastructure investment and traditional
Democratic proposals like increased education spending, amid the rise of powers like China and India,
alongside gestures to Republicans seeking deep budget cuts. Results from a national exam released the day
of the speech revealed that fewer than one-third of elementary- and high-school students have a solid grasp
of science. The speech also laid out areas of potential cooperation between the parties, including a call to
rewrite the corporate tax code. The Republican-controlled House wants much deeper and more immediate
cuts in domestic spending.
-- The president's new team is coming together, including White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, National
Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Press Secretary Jay Carney. Business groups said they would
fight the renomination of Craig Becker to the National Labor Relations Board. Joseph Smith, the
administration's pick to run the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, doesn't want to be
renominated, in the face of strong Republican opposition, a White House official said. Energy czar Carol
Browner is leaving her post, which is likely to be eliminated. The position, and Browner herself, have been
lightning rods for critics of the president's environmental policy.
---
World
-- Uprisings in Egypt shook the Arab world, threatened the future of some of Washington's closest allies in the
region and raised the specter that Islamic radicals could seize on the protests against authoritarian
governments. Egypt's President Mubarak, defying Washington's call to embrace reform, declared a curfew in
riot-racked cities as tanks rolled down the street to beat back protesters. Local stocks and the Egyptian pound
plunged. The rallies, in Jordan, Yemen and Algeria, too, were inspired by the toppling of Tunisian President
Ben Ali on Jan. 14. In Lebanon, meanwhile, the ouster of a Western-allied government set back U.S. efforts
to blunt the influence of Iran and Syria in the region.

-- Leaked documents show extensive collaboration between Palestinian security forces and their Israeli
counterparts, a relationship Israeli commanders say has been central to security gains in the West Bank. The
documents, released by al Jazeera, spurred anger in the Palestinian territories at the Palestinian Authority
leadership, which has held uncompromising positions in public but appears to have negotiated poorly with
Israel in private.
-- A suicide-bomb blast killed 35 people at Russia's busiest airport. Officials said they suspect Islamist
insurgents based in the Caucasus.
-- The threat of inflation, the burden of public pensions and Europe's approach to its debt crisis dominated
the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. China sent its largest delegation ever, underlining
its growing influence on the global economy. Meanwhile, world-wide fears about unsustainable government
borrowing reached Japan, as S&P issued a surprise downgrade of its bonds, the first since 2002, and
slammed the nation's political leaders for having no "coherent strategy" to tackle Japan's quickly worsening
fiscal problems.
-- Afghan President Karzai inaugurated the country's new parliament, ending a six-month power vacuum
during which he ruled by decree.
---
Business
-- Ford Motor reported an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter earnings, to $190 million from $886 million a year
earlier, on rising costs in North America, a loss in Europe and special charges related to debt reduction. It
was also a big decline from the $1.7 billion of the third quarter. The year as a whole was one of Ford's best.
-- Amazon bested many of its retail rivals during the holiday shopping season but spent dearly to expand,
chewing into profit. Cost-cutting helped Yahoo's profit more than double, but revenue declined 12% as the
company struggled to keep pace with Google and Facebook. Microsoft reported strong demand in the holiday
quarter for its Office software and Kinect accessory.
-- A lawsuit filed by 89-year-old Chinese tycoon Stanley Ho against some of his children and their mothers
portends a protracted legal battle over control of the Macau casino empire.
-- Sara Lee said its board agreed in principle to split the company's two main businesses in the face of
takeover bids. Some questioned whether the breakup would pay off as well for shareholders as a sale.
-- Warehouse giant ProLogis was close to a pact to merge with its biggest rival, AMB Property, in what would
be the largest deal in years for publicly traded real-estate companies.
-- Packaging maker Rock-Tenn agreed to purchase Smurfit for $3.5 billion in cash and stock just seven
months after Smurfit emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.
-- Toyota Motor said it would recall more than 1.7 million vehicles world-wide because of faulty parts.
-- Air France-KLM's operations lack "strong safety leadership at all levels of management," an independent
study found. It said the result was lax cockpit discipline, ineffective pilot training and "an unhealthy
relationship" with unions.
---
Markets
-- John Paulson personally netted more than $5 billion in profits last year, likely the largest one-year haul in
investing history, trumping the nearly $4 billion he made with his bearish bets against subprime mortgages in
2007. Appaloosa's David Tepper and Bridgewater's Ray Dalio each made between $2 billion and $3 billion.
The gains came from bets on commodities, emerging-market companies and bank shares, among others.
-- Unrest in Egypt put a damper on the Dow industrials, which flirted with 12000 but then snapped an
eight-week winning streak, falling 0.4% on the week to end at 11823.70. Oil prices surged Friday on the
Egyptian turmoil, helping crude scratch out a weekly gain of 0.3%. Gold continued its January descent, falling
for the fourth week in a row.
-- Investors and regulators are growing skeptical of the information state and local governments disclose
about their finances. The SEC is looking into statements Illinois made about reducing its pension-fund costs,
amid the agency's scrutiny of the muni-bond market. Separately, banks are making it harder for municipalities
to renegotiate bond deals, tightening lending standards and demanding more for letters of credit.

-- U.S. taxpayers are expected to reap a $12.3 billion profit on the government's $45 billion Citigroup
investment, as the U.S. completes its exit. The Treasury estimates the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief
Program will end up costing taxpayers about $28 billion.

Banks will need a lot more capital if we want to avoid financial disasters like the one that just shook the world,
according to the economists. Critics say that would hurt the economy by pushing up the cost of lending. But in
a new paper, the economists estimate that a permanent one-percentage-point reduction in the probability of
crisis is worth more than half a year's economic output, or about nine times the cost of permanently doubling
banks' capital ratios. Assuming that severe crises tend to come along every few decades or so, the optimal
capital level would be 52% of assets, weighted according to their riskiness. That compares to the 7%
requirement most big banks must meet by 2019.

Egypt Unrest Stokes Oil, Gold --- Crude Surges 4.3%; Gold Rebounds From Four-Month Lows in Flight to Safety

Egypt Unrest Stokes Oil, Gold --- Crude Surges 4.3%; Gold Rebounds From Four-Month Lows in
Flight to Safety

The violent protests in Egypt pushed both crude-oil and gold prices higher, as investors fled risky assets but
acknowledged the Mideast country's proximity to larger oil producers.
Gold bounced from four-month lows hit during intraday trade to close $22.30, or 1.7%, higher at $1,340.70 an
ounce.
"Egypt has got markets nervous," said Sterling Smith, market analyst at Country Hedging in Minnesota. "That
is naturally a good environment for gold."
Benchmark crude-oil futures surged 4.3% to settle at $89.34 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
It was the biggest one-day jump for Nymex crude since September 2009, in both percentage and dollar
terms.
Nymex crude also outpaced its European counterpart Brent, narrowing the price gap between the two. Brent
crude on ICE futures neared $100 a barrel. The contract gained 2.1% to end at $99.42 a barrel.
"We don't know if this thing is going to stop spreading," said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. "We may come in here Monday with a new leadership in
Egypt."
Egypt produces about 673,000 barrels of oil a day, according to the Joint Oil Data Initiative, a database,
ranking it 21st among the world's oil producers.
More importantly, the country is home to two of the world's key energy supply routes: the Suez Canal, a
transit point for oil and fuel shipments from the Persian Gulf to the Western Hemisphere, and the
200-mile-long Sumed pipeline, an alternative transit route to the canal.
About one million barrels of oil a day was shipped through each route during 2009, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.
More worrisome than disruptions to Egypt's oil production is the prospect that the unrest spreads to other
hard-line states in the region, such as Libya and Algeria, both members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Other countries in the region, including Tunisia and Yemen, have been wracked by
antigovernment protests in recent weeks, though neither is a major oil producer.
"If this thing spreads across the North African continent, gets into Libya, Algeria, then you've got trouble," said
Stephen Schork, editor of the Schork Report energy newsletter.
The price difference between Nymex futures and Brent, a more common reference point in Europe, widened
to a record $12.49 before ending the day at $10.08.
Investors were largely scrambling toward assets viewed as a safe haven in times of turmoil. Gold is often
considered a haven against political turmoil or economic downturns in part because it isn't as linked to
industrial production as are other assets, such as stocks.
The gains in gold came during a prolonged price correction for the metal. Through Thursday's close, gold
futures had lost more than 7% this year as investors gained confidence in the economy, feeling less of a
need for gold as a hedge against financial turmoil and European sovereign-debt woes.

Gold Producer's Chief Sees
Bright Prospects in Gloom
Gold holds luster as a haven in uncertain times. That's why Peter Munk, chairman of the world's largest gold
producer Barrick Gold, likes the metal's long-term prospects.
"If you are a utopian, if you believe the problems of currency, the problems of terrorism, the problems of
unrest around the world will all be resolved by the end of the year, then gold would have a difficult path," he
said. "If you believe like I do that we bought ourselves a temporary peace from the panic of last year and the
year before, [and] that the fundamentality of the problems are still long-term issues, then your attitude will be
a bit more positive toward gold." He may have a point. Comex gold for February delivery jumped $22.30, or
1.7%, Friday, to $1,340.70 an ounce, though prices were down for the week, the fourth in a row.

A Complacent, 'Arrogant'
Showing at the Forum
The Davos discussion seems to be avoiding some big issues this year, says Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP
and one of the world's leading image meisters.
Income inequality and its effects on economic growth and stability is one of the overlooked issues. Mr. Sorrell
said there should be more focus on how excessive wealth concentration can lead to insufficient consumer
demand and unproductive investment, feeding bubbles and subsequent economic busts.
Asked if the Davos crowd had become complacent this year, he said yes, and maybe "a little bit arrogant."
-- Alan Murray
Bankers, Finance Ministers
Take Aim at the Yuan
China's refusal to allow its currency to float freely may be the international financial system's biggest problem,
finance ministers and central bank chiefs said.
"The renminbi over time should have a role as a reserve currency," said Bank of Canada Governor Mark
Carney. "But what's required for that to happen will solve most of the issues we're talking about."
The strategy of hoping that China will allow its currency to float on its own is unlikely to work, said Bank of
Israel Governor Stanley Fischer. "The theory of, 'Don't push us, then we'll do it on our own, just stop
bothering us,' is a nice argument to make," Mr. Fischer said. "Whether it actually will result in anything is very
doubtful."
-- Matthew Dalton
Geithner Calls Inflation
'Not High' on Priority List
Inflation on a global level is "not high on the list of concerns," even though emerging markets are certainly
"feeling some pressure," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said.

--- Page 150 ---
Page 150 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
He said emerging markets could manage their inflation problems better if they loosened their links to the
dollar, a move economists say would lead in most cases to an appreciation against the greenback. Mr.
Geithner also said he's "very confident that the euro will survive, but argued that Europe needs time to put in
place reforms to make that possible.
As for the U.S.'s own woes, he admitted the current position is "unsustainable in the long run" adding the
government needs to lay out a credible, multiyear path to sustainability. He bemoaned the fact that the U.S.
political system lacks any mechanism to enforce this.
-- Geoffrey T. Smith
Billionaire Bets on India
Vladimir Yevtushenkov is placing his bets on India for emerging-markets growth, despite Davos's record 66
Chinese attendees, freshly made dumplings and paper dragons.
Aside from its mobile telecom provider in India, the billionaire's AFK Sistema is leaning toward tapping Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. as its major foreign partner when it unites its Russian oil assets ahead of a possible initial
public offering. "India is more promising for investment, in my opinion," Mr. Yevtushenkov said. "China
doesn't allow companies to invest in mobile telecoms, but India allows it."

Dow Declines 166 On Egypt Unrest

Protests in the streets of Egypt shook global financial markets on Friday, tempering the optimism that has
dominated investor sentiment so far this year.
Though most investors believed the effects of the protests would fade quickly, few were taking chances on
Friday.
"The more-dire situation would be continued instability in the Middle East, leading to oil prices continuing to
rise and having a real economic impact," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust in
Chicago. "The odds favor things settling down, but it's hard to say."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 166.13 points, or 1.4%, to 11823.70, the worst one-day performance
for the blue-chip index since mid November. The day also saw the index retreat further from 12000 after
flirting with the milestone for much of the week.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.8%, to 1276.34, after approaching 1300 for the first time since
August 2008. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which struggled with technical problems early in the trading day,
fell 2.5% to 2686.89.
Nymex crude-oil prices surged $3.70 or 4% to $89.34 a barrel on fears that turmoil in Egypt could spread
throughout the region and threaten the supply of crude, a significant amount of which travels through Egypt's
Suez Canal.
Egyptian financial markets were closed on Friday, but the effects of the riots there were seen in other
markets. The Market Vectors Egypt Index, an exchange-traded fund of Egypt-related stocks, fell 3.4% on
Friday and is down nearly 21% in the past two weeks.
In Turkey, the most liquid Middle Eastern market, government-bond prices fell, and the Turkish lira fell to its
lowest level against the dollar since April 2009.
The cost of protecting against the sovereign default of other countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia
and Morocco, jumped. Saudi credit-default swap prices, which typically move very little, rose 57.5%,
according to Markit.
Safe-haven investments were in hot demand. Ten-year Treasury notes rose, pushing their yield to 3.333%.
Comex gold prices jumped $22.30 an ounce or 1.7% to $1,340.70.
The Dow ended lower on the week, breaking an eight-week winning streak dating back to last December. The
last time the Dow had such a streak was in March to April of 2009.
That string of gains was broken by Europe's sovereign-debt crisis, and Friday's action was reminiscent of the
turmoil last spring. European debt issues, along with the "flash crash" in U.S. stocks around the same time,
derailed investor confidence for months.
Turmoil in the Middle East doesn't seem to raise the sort of systemic risks for global financial markets that
Europe's crisis did, many observers said. That suggests Friday's market fears could be short-lived.
Nevertheless, the news out of Egypt may have offered an excuse for a pause in financial markets that some
skeptics say have come too far, too fast in recent months.
Lee Munson, chief investment officer of Albuquerque, N.M., wealth manager Portfolio LLC, said the
escalating crisis in Egypt caused "bedlam" on his firm's trading desk on Friday as traders scrambled to
assess the impact on their gold and oil positions.

--- Page 152 ---
Page 152 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Mr. Munson said he moved money into cash, after months of being bullish on equities. Though it meant he
missed the rallies in gold and oil on Friday, Mr. Munson said he felt good about his decision, concerned that
the unrest could spread elsewhere in the Middle East.
"I've been bullish for a while," Mr. Munson said. "To get me to stop and pause, it took a riot."
Recent unrest in the Middle East may just be the beginning, to the extent that it has been fostered by rising
commodity prices, driven by emerging-market demand and easy monetary policy in developed economies.
Egypt is a net importer of food and fuel, and its government has been weakening the Egyptian pound in an
effort to bolster the export sector. It has been importing inflation as a result, noted Rachel Ziemba, a senior
analyst of geostrategic risks at Roubini Global Economics. It is not alone in the world.
"The financial and economic stresses that are underlying forces in Egypt are pervasive in other countries,"
Ms. Ziemba said. "They could result in not only higher inflation in those countries and throughout the world,
but also in stresses to institutions."
The political turmoil also serves as a reminder of the risks facing investors who have poured into emerging
markets in recent years on the promise of higher returns without making distinctions between markets.
An Egyptian 10-year bond issued last May with a 5.75% coupon now yields 7.02%, according to Michael
Roche, emerging-markets strategist at MF Global. Yields move inversely to prices, and that rise represents a
drop in price of more than 9%.
Egyptian sovereign debt is thinly traded and mainly held by Egyptian banks, Mr. Roche notes, but will likely
suffer more.
"Emerging markets aren't a monolithic story; there are definitely weak spots," said Win Thin, head of
emerging-markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. "That gets papered over when sentiment is positive,
but when things are uncertain, it becomes glaring."

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Wealth Manager: Is Gold's Golden Era Over?
WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Wealth Manager: Is Gold's Golden Era Over?

Gold certainly is cheaper these days, having fallen 5.7% in 2011 alone. But investors who rush in now could
be setting themselves up for disappointment.
Classically a hedge against inflation, gold morphed into a hedge against economic collapse during the
financial crisis and rallied strongly last year as fears mounted of a double-dip recession in the U.S. and a debt
crisis in Europe. Those fears have largely eased, though gold did rally Friday on turmoil in the Middle East.
By and large, investing in gold is once again a bet on global inflation.
While there are signs of higher costs for raw materials in the U.S. and abroad, prices might not be rising fast
enough to justify gold's current price of $1,340.70 an ounce, say some strategists. Emerging-market central
banks, meanwhile, are raising interest rates to tackle rising prices.
"For gold to rise there needs to be demand for a safe haven, a weak U.S. dollar and inflation fears," says
Pierre Lapointe, a strategist at brokerage firm Brockhouse Cooper. "We don't see any of these in 2011."
The price of gold largely reflects investor sentiment rather than fundamental demand, which is one reason it
kept rising for most of the past 10 years. But speculators already have cut their bullish bets on gold to the
lowest level since 2009. Heavier selling, in turn, could beget still more selling.
Exchange-traded funds are particularly worrisome: Big redemptions there could force enormous amounts of
the metal into the marketplace, further pressuring prices. The amount of gold held by ETFs has dropped by
about 2.8% since the beginning of the year, according to Brockhouse Cooper, bringing it to the lowest level
since June.
Another recent source of buying -- by gold producers unwinding hedges used to protect profits against price
fluctuations -- also has nearly come to an end. That is because most of the hedges were put in place at much
lower price levels, forcing companies to sell well below market prices and damping profits. On Jan. 13,
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. said it had closed its hedge book, becoming the last of the major gold companies to
do so.
"Financial demand propelled gold higher over the past few quarters," Mr. Lapointe says. "We doubt more is
on the way."
How far could gold fall in the short term? Technical measures suggest that gold's current price is close to its
near-term "support" level -- the price at which investors, attracted by a perceived bargain, are expected to
rush in. If it falls below $1,320 and stays there, the next price where buyers would be expected to cluster
would be near $1,280.
Over the longer term, too, the case for gold seems less compelling, say some analysts. While the metal has
traditionally been seen as a buffer against runaway inflation and a collapsing dollar, at these prices gold
may have less value as an insurance policy than investors might think.
Take inflation. From 1968 -- when investors started to price in the possibility of the U.S. dropping the gold
standard -- to 2001, the price of gold rose 5.6% a year, while the Consumer Price Index gained 5.1%
annually. That hasn't been the case recently: Since 2001 gold has surged 18.8% annually, while the CPI has
risen just 2.3%.
To restore their historical relationship, inflation would have to rise by 8.3% a year for the next 20 years to
justify current prices. If inflation were to rise by its average since 1968 of 4.7%, gold would have to drop
3.6% a year for the next 20 years, according to Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Burns Advisory
Group. "This latest gold craze is way overdone," he says.

--- Page 154 ---
Page 154 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
Even assuming the price of gold now includes a premium for protection against a falling dollar, a collapse in
the stock market and inflation, gold still looks expensive, says Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at
Alliance Bernstein Research. He calculates that the current price reflects fears of a 20% decline in stocks, a
20% drop in the dollar and an inflation rate above 4%, based on historical performance. (The inflation rate
is currently 1.5%.) If investors think any of those outcomes is likely, gold may still be a buy. Otherwise, they
are better off waiting for a lower price.
"Gold is an insurance policy, and the cost of insurance has been going up," Mr. Zlotnikov says. "A decline to
$1,100 would be reflecting a more-benign market environment."
Of course, critics have been saying gold has been expensive for years, and past pullbacks have been buying
opportunities for much of the past decade. During 2010 alone, gold twice dipped more than 7% before
rallying to new highs.
On Friday, gold rose 1.8% as protests in Egypt turned deadly, destabilizing global markets. If the turmoil
there spreads, or new fears of European defaults, raging inflation or U.S. economic deterioration emerge,
gold could spike further.
So what's an investor to do? If you have a large position in gold, now may be a good time to take profits,
says John "Launny" Steffens, founder of Spring Mountain Capital, an investment-management firm in New
York.
Yet despite gold's high cost, Mr. Steffens says it still has a place in a portfolio and that investors should
devote 5% to 7% of their portfolios to the metal to hedge against the unexpected. "Just don't expect it to go
up 30% every year," he says.

(The Penguin Press, 369 pages, $27.95)
Samuel Curtis Upham, born in 1819, was in many respects the classic American success story. Raised in
Montpelier, Vt., he tired of sleepy New England and set off for bigger and better things. After stints out West
as a gold prospector, pickle vendor and newspaperman, he returned East. The first shots of the Civil War
found him the proprietor of a prosperous Philadelphia stationery shop.
There Upham might have passed the rest of his days in obscurity but for a surprising talent that he
discovered early in 1862. Noticing widespread fascination with a picture of a Confederate bill printed in a local
newspaper, Upham bought the engraved plate from the paper, commissioned a printer to run off 3,000 copies
and started retailing them as mementoes of what, at the time, was expected to be a brief insurrection. Each
note, at the bottom, proclaimed "Fac-simile," with Upham's name and address. But it was soon discovered
that, by cutting the strip off, the bill would be accepted as genuine.
Suddenly Upham's mementoes started working their way South, carried by Union soldiers on the march and
blockade-runners on the prowl. The notes served to undermine confidence in Confederate money, already
weakened by Richmond's economic mismanagement and doubts about the prospects for the South's success
in the war.
As Ben Tarnoff tells us in "Moneymakers," his portrait of three American counterfeiters, Upham was probably
not the first Union patriot to try this form of economic warfare; he certainly wasn't the last. An enterprising
New Yorker, Winthrop E. Hilton, was soon selling his customers fake Confederate notes with a higher face
value for less Union money -- a sign that even counterfeit Confederate bills were depreciating rapidly. Upham
conceived of his own venture as a form of souvenir vending. Perhaps it was, but the scale was immense: By
his own estimate (offered a decade later), he produced bills with a total face value of $15 million. If all of them
found their way to the Confederacy, then a whopping 3% of the South's circulating money was printed by one
man in Philadelphia.
Upham's narrative takes up what is the longest and most engrossing chapter in "Moneymakers," and rightly
so. The details of his exploits are fascinating in themselves, including a blood-curdling voyage around Cape
Horn to California. His counterfeiting motives also make him more sympathetic. Like the Southern leaders
whom Mr. Tarnoff describes, we are made to see the North's Confederate moneymaking activity as
"something more . . . than a handful of hustlers angling for a profit." Upham was fighting the Civil War by
other means.
Alas, Mr. Tarnoff's other subjects are less compelling, in part because they are mere hustlers angling for a
profit. Owen Sullivan, active in the colonial era, was an Irishman of uncertain origins who set up a
counterfeiting gang in a boggy slice of territory claimed by both New York and Connecticut. Eventually, his
luck ran out, and he was hanged for his troubles in 1756. David Lewis (1788-1820), who never met a
Pennsylvania jail he couldn't break out of, started out as a counterfeiter before converting to brigandage on
country highways, ultimately dying of wounds sustained in a shoot-out with a posse assembled to arrest him.
Part of Mr. Tarnoff's problem is scant source material. We know as much as we do about Upham because his
counterfeiting was more or less legal. But Sullivan and Lewis were criminals. Much of their activity occurred
underground, and they had little interest in leaving behind accurate memoirs, let alone documentary
evidence. For their narratives Mr. Tarnoff provides historical context but precious few biographical details.

Instead, he pads out his account with clumsy attempts to equate those rogues with the above-ground
financiers in their own day and ours. He argues that the careers of his counterfeiters "mirrored the evolving
confidence game of American capitalism, a machine that ran on various kinds of debt and deception" and that
the counterfeiters' spirits can still be found "on the trading floors where speculators bet money they didn't
have on a mercurial stock market." In reality, counterfeiting cuts at the foundations of commercial society by
undermining public trust in the medium of exchange and store of value -- one reason it was once a hanging
offense.
Mr. Tarnoff is surely closer to the truth with his frequent reminders that Sullivan, Lewis and Upham thrived in
periods of governmental monetary recklessness. Colonial governments were chronic mismanagers -- in one
four-year period, from 1744 to 1748, Massachusetts printed money so often that it suffered a stunning 50%
devaluation of its notes. Lewis's life coincided with an ill-conceived explosion of government-granted bank
charters allowing thousands of new institutions to issue bills for circulation. The Confederacy of Upham's day
never could resist the siren song of the printing press.
Far from being the ne plus ultra of American capitalism, then, counterfeiters are deft imitators -- or exploiters
-- of the government's own economy-wrecking policies. Nor should we tie counterfeiters conceptually to
modern Wall Street, where, according to Mr. Tarnoff, "people wield complex financial instruments like magic
wands, spinning false fortunes out of the ether of global capitalism." In the past decade, it was the Federal
Reserve that, by holding interest rates too low for far too long, made possible a kind of financial
recklessness of which Sullivan or Lewis could only dream and which the honest businessman Upham might
have feared.
In our own day, Kim Jong Il's North Korea is said to have produced some $45 million in high-quality fake
"supernotes" with which to undermine the U.S. economy. But the recent decline in the dollar's value, to less
than one-1,300th of an ounce of gold, has nothing to do with a dictator's schemes and everything to do with
Ben Bernanke's decision, at the Fed, to increase the official money supply by trillion-dollar increments. Not
even Samuel Upham could have pulled that off.

Trader Racks Up A Second Epic Gain --- $5 Billion Profit For John Paulson
Trader Racks Up A Second Epic Gain --- $5 Billion Profit For John Paulson

Hedge-fund manager John Paulson personally netted more than $5 billion in profits in 2010 -- likely the
largest one-year haul in investing history, trumping the nearly $4 billion he made with his "short" bets against
subprime mortgages in 2007.
Mr. Paulson's take, described by investors and people close to investment firm Paulson & Co., shows how
profits continue to pile up for elite hedge-fund managers. Appaloosa Management founder David Tepper and
Bridgewater Associates chief Ray Dalio each personally made between $2 billion and $3 billion last year,
according to investors and people familiar with the situation. James Simons, founder of Renaissance
Technologies LLC, also produced profits in that range, say investors in his firm.
By comparison, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall Street's most profitable investment bank, paid all of its
36,000 employees a total of $8.35 billion last year. James Gorman, chief executive of 76-year-old investment
bank Morgan Stanley, is expected to receive compensation of less than $15 million for 2010.
Mr. Paulson and his fellow managers seldom take much of their profits in cash. Some of the profits are
so-called paper gains, which reflect the rising value of their firms' holdings, and could erode if those
investments sour. Other gains come from selling investments, and most of those are rolled back into their
funds.
Mr. Paulson and the other top managers made winning bets on commodities, emerging-market companies,
bank shares and U.S. Treasury bonds, among other investments. These moves, along with profitable picks
by other funds, are part of the reason the hedge-fund industry is back on its feet after a rough stretch. Assets
managed by hedge funds have grown to a near-record $1.92 trillion, up 20% over the past year. Assets
jumped almost $150 billion in the fourth quarter alone, the largest quarterly growth on record, according to
Hedge Fund Research, Inc.
Still, the average fund gained just 10.49% last year, according to the research firm. That's well below the 15%
gain of the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, including dividends, and the 19% return of the average stock
mutual fund, raising questions about whether the industry can profitably invest the influx of new cash.
Indeed, the enormous gains by Mr. Paulson and the other managers resulted from solid, though not
spectacular, performance. Their personal gains came in part from the sheer scale of assets under their
control. The largest hedge fund in Mr. Paulson's $36 billion investment portfolio, Advantage Plus, grew 17%
last year, while another big one rose 11%, falling below returns for the broader stock market.
Part of Mr. Paulson's more that $5 billion profit came from his firm's 20% cut of his funds' profits, known in the
industry as the "performance fee." Those fees amounted to roughly $1 billion last year, according to a person
familiar with the matter. An added plus for Mr. Paulson: A chunk of those profits are treated as long-term
capital gains and taxed at a far lower rate than the standard income-tax rate.
More than $4 billion came from gains on Mr. Paulson's investments in his funds.
Mr. Paulson amped up profits for himself and many of his investors in a novel way. He was worried about
long-term weakness of the dollar and other major currencies, so he devised a way to embed a bet on gold
into each of his funds -- for those investors who opted for that approach. Mr. Paulson has placed the bulk of
his own wealth in these gold-denominated funds and a separate gold-focused fund. Because gold rose
sharply in value last year, the gold-denominated versions of his funds rose as much as 45%.
The performance last year, nevertheless, paled in comparison to his 2007 returns, when Mr. Paulson made a
huge wager against subprime mortgages and his funds scored gains of as much as 590%.

Last year "wasn't the greatest trade of all time, but to manage more than $30 billion and still have gains
topping 30% is very rare in the hedge-fund business," says Jeffrey Tarrant, who helps run Protege Partners,
a New York firm that invested in Paulson & Co. in the past.
One way to view the size of Mr. Paulson's $5 billion profit: It is nearly as much as the $6.4 billion that Forbes
magazine last year estimated as the total net worth of Steven Cohen, the well-known head of $12 billion
hedge-fund firm SAC Capital. (Mr. Cohen likely added about $1 billion in 2010, one investor says, after 16%
gains in his flagship fund).
Appaloosa's chief, Mr. Tepper, who specializes in distressed-debt investing and manages around $16 billion,
notched gains of about 30% by turning optimistic about U.S. stocks before many rivals. Mr. Tepper correctly
anticipated the Federal Reserve's recent efforts to boost the economy, steps that have helped the market
rally.
Mr. Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, which manages $86 billion in hedge funds and other vehicles, made an
early shift to U.S. Treasurys, commodities and emerging-market currencies. He correctly anticipated that the
Fed would flood the financial system with cash to help the economy, something that would boost bond and
gold prices. Bridgewater also anticipated growth in China and emerging markets, which it figured would help
commodities and currencies of those nations. Its hedge funds gained more than 30% last year.
Mr. Simons no longer runs day-to-day trading at Renaissance Technologies, which manages nearly $16
billion and specializes in lightning-quick computer-based trades, so his pay actually dropped a bit in 2010.
But Mr. Simons still owns the bulk of the firm and invests in its hedge funds. Renaissance's two funds
available to outside investors, Renaissance Institutional Equities and Institutional Futures funds, gained about
18% last year, following a disappointing 2009 when the firm considered closing them to outsiders.
Renaissance's Medallion fund, which is primarily open to Renaissance employees like Mr. Simons and has
long recorded big gains, climbed about 30%, according to people close to the matter.
The hedge-fund business now is so big that some managers are hinting they'll return money to clients instead
of investing it. Handling so much cash can make it hard to generate big gains in some trading strategies.
Mr. Tepper, for example, has told some investors to expect to receive some cash back in 2011. He returned
$500 million to investors last year. This year, he may return several billion dollars, according to people close
to the matter.
Other firms, such as Paulson & Co., have closed certain funds to new investors, but are actively raising new
money for other funds. Mr. Paulson recently hosted a New York City event that featured speeches by former
Fed chief Alan Greenspan and several chief executives of gold companies, aimed at boosting interest in his
gold-focused fund.
Despite Mr. Paulson's winning touch in 2010, he may face a challenge. Gold is down more than 6% so far in
2011, meaning he is likely starting out with losses.

Inflation Concerns Take a Toll on Treasurys

Inflation Concerns Take a Toll on Treasurys

NEW YORK -- Treasurys fell Wednesday, led by the 30-year bond, as the Federal Reserve's latest
interest-rate statement prompted investors to deliver a double shot to the bond market.
At the conclusion of its two-day monetary-policy meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee said in a
statement the economy continues to improve but at a pace that isn't sufficient for the central bank to
consider scaling back the $600 billion Treasury bond-buying program launched in early November.
The Fed's continued pledge to support the economy lured some investors into the U.S. stock markets.
Some other investors, meanwhile, cut Treasury bond holdings, fretting that the stimulus could generate
inflation at a time when consumer prices have surged in many countries.
Inflation eats into bonds' fixed returns over time. The 30-year bond was the biggest loser as its value is the
most sensitive to changes in consumer prices. Gold, a popular hedge against inflation, also rose.
"Policy makers continue to kick the cans down the road," said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasury trading at
Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. "Some investors simply got out of their 'long' positions."
A long is a bet on gains in bond prices.
In late-afternoon trading, the benchmark 10-year note was 24/32 lower to yield 3.426%.
The 30-year bond was 1 21/32 lower to yield 4.596%.
Bond prices move inversely to yields.
Still, the 10-year yield was lower compared with a seven-month peak of 3.568% made in December.
Mixed View on Nassau
The move by a New York state watchdog board Wednesday to assume control of Nassau County's finances
will likely weaken Nassau bond prices for the short-term, but ultimately fiscal oversight is positive for bond
holders, analysts said.
The Nassau County Interim Finance Authority, or NIFA, voted unanimously to give itself the power to review
the operation and management of county government, approve borrowing and contracts and institute wage
freezes in Nassau County.
It is the first time the suburb next to New York City has been placed under state control. No significant trades
were seen after the decision.

Obama: U.S. Must Compete --- Citing Global Jobs Race, President Calls for Spending Cuts But Also New Initiatives
Obama: U.S. Must Compete --- Citing Global Jobs Race, President Calls for Spending Cuts But Also
New Initiatives

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama used his State of the Union address Tuesday to ask the nation to
meet the challenges of a global economy, framing what he called a competitiveness agenda that includes
traditional Democratic proposals like increased education spending, alongside gestures to Republicans
seeking deep budget cuts.
Mr. Obama said the nation needs to address its rising budget deficit but couldn't afford to back away from
new spending on programs that he said would allow the U.S. to compete with rising powers like China and
India -- an approach Republicans were quick to reject as unaffordable. Mr. Obama also laid out areas of
potential cooperation between the parties, such as a call to rewrite the corporate tax code.
The president answered Republican calls for steep budget cuts with a far more modest proposal to freeze a
portion of government spending for five years. The bulk of his speech had larger aims: to recapture the policy
initiative after his party's devastating losses in November and to inspire a nation worried about its place in a
sometimes threatening global economy.
"We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world," Mr. Obama said in tones that
resembled a halftime pep talk. "We have to make America the best place on earth to do business."
More than two months after what he described as his party's "shellacking" in midterm elections, Mr. Obama
didn't appear to be on the defense. His pivot to the political center has boosted his poll ratings and captured
the nation's attention. Before a national television audience, he hoped to use that attention to recapture the
momentum on policy -- or at least share it with resurgent Republicans.
Among other proposals, Mr. Obama called on the nation to prepare 100,000 new math, science and
engineering teachers. He used the Cold War imagery of the Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite
more than half a century ago to exhort a new generation to counter a new challenge: global competition.
"After investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of
innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs,"" Mr. Obama said.
And he laid down a series of goals: By 2035, he said 80% of America's electricity should come from clean
energy sources. Within 25 years, 80% of Americans should have access to high-speed rail. Within five years,
communications businesses should be able to deploy high-speed wireless to 98% of all Americans. He did
little to explain how those goals would be reached beyond pledges to boost federal spending on infrastructure
and basic research.
Much of what the president called for to boost the nation's competitiveness are items he has pushed for two
years. Many of them -- such as investments in high-speed rail, expanded Internet access and more
infrastructure spending -- were central to his stimulus plan of 2009.
But in some cases, Mr. Obama pressed to move to a new level. For instance, he said he would launch a
national wireless initiative to augment an earlier push for broadband Internet access in rural areas.
And he said he would use expanded tax rebates and competitive grant programs to get consumers to buy
electric vehicles and help communities build the infrastructure for the next generation of clean cars. That
piggybacks on the stimulus program's efforts to stimulate advanced battery production.
In the Republicans' formal response, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said his party
would take the lead in shrinking government and reducing spending.
"Our nation is approaching a tipping point," said Mr. Ryan. "We are at a moment, where if government's
growth is left unchecked and unchallenged, America's best century will be considered our past century. This

is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into
lives of complacency and dependency."
He also derided Democrats' effort to describe new spending proposals as "investments."
"Whether sold as 'stimulus' or repackaged as 'investment,' their actions show they want a federal government
that controls too much; taxes too much; and spends too much in order to do too much," Mr. Ryan said.
Republicans were underwhelmed by the president's pledge to freeze spending for five years on nonsecurity,
discretionary spending. Such spending is a relatively small portion of total outlays, accounting for roughly
15% of the $3.5 trillion spent by the federal government last year.
"It strikes me as too little, too late," said Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), a member of the new Republican
House leadership team. "After this huge inflation of spending, he's willing to level-fund it. If that's his idea of
fiscal responsibility, this nation is in deep trouble."
Mr. Obama's freeze proposal in essence extends a plan for a three-year freeze that he laid out in his State of
the Union speech a year ago. Even Democrats were calling for a more aggressive approach, at least in
defense spending.
In urging lawmakers to rewrite corporate tax law, Mr. Obama said tax breaks should be eliminated in order to
cover the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. If Congress follows through, the process is sure to set off a
lobbying scramble among businesses and could serve as a precursor to the more difficult task of rewriting tax
law for individuals -- an effort that Mr. Obama also said he was willing to undertake.
White House officials said the overhaul should be revenue-neutral: neither raise additional revenue nor add to
the deficit.
The president called for $8 billion a year in research and development on clean-energy technologies, a
one-third increase, toward a goal of putting one million clean cars on the road by 2015. He also called for
eliminating $4 billion in tax deductions to oil companies to help cover the cost of the new spending, a
proposal the oil industry said was unfair and would hurt jobs.
"It is difficult to understand why we need to discriminate against our single largest form of energy at a time the
nation needs additional jobs and revenue," said Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum
Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade group that represents most major oil companies.
Mr. Obama proposed his programs to a Congress where much of the political momentum is flowing toward
austerity. Before the president took to the podium, the House voted to give Mr. Ryan broad new powers to cut
spending quickly.
On Wednesday, a group of Senate Republicans planned to revive a push for a constitutional amendment
mandating balanced budgets, an issue little heard of since the heyday of the Republican "revolution" of 1994.
Mr. Obama delivered only one veto threat in his State of the Union address. He said he will not sign spending
bills that contain pet projects of lawmakers, known as earmarks.
Republicans have vowed to forgo earmarks, but Democrats have generally declined to join them. Banning
earmarks "takes power away from the legislative branch of government, and I think it's the wrong thing to do,"
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.
Some of Mr. Obama's proposals seemed aimed at pleasing business groups. The president promised to work
with Republicans on "medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits." He called for quick action on
free-trade agreements, especially the newly completed free-trade accord with South Korea.
Mr. Obama extended an invitation to lawmakers to address Social Security's looming financial crunch, as the
Baby Boom generation retires. But he made clear he would oppose dramatic changes unsuccessfully pushed
by his predecessor, George W. Bush, who wanted to allow some Social Security taxes to be invested in the
stock market.
Mr. Obama said he would oppose "slashing benefits" for future retirees, but that left open the possibility of
benefit trims that budget experts in both parties believe is necessary.
The president pledged to offset his proposed spending increases with cuts elsewhere. His five-year freeze on
nonsecurity domestic spending, while affecting a small part of the overall budget, would nonetheless shrink
anticipated budget deficits by more than $400 billion over the next decade, said Gene Sperling, director of Mr.
Obama's National Economic Council.

Mr. Obama didn't detail the kind of efforts that would shrink government as much as Republicans have
demanded. But he promised a reorganization of the federal government, including merging and consolidating
agencies, and vowed to submit such a plan to Congress for a vote.

Commodities prices retreated, taking a cue from the U.K. economy's surprise contraction.
Bucking the trend were cocoa and wheat, which rose on political instability in Africa and the Middle East.
Both industrial and agricultural commodity prices were hit by the selloff, with natural-gas, copper, coffee and
soybean futures all ending down more than 2%. Palladium was off almost 4%. The Dow Jones-UBS
Commodity Index fell 1.7% to 158.12.
"A lot of it is panic selling," said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist with Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
Fueling the flight from relatively risky assets was the announcement that the U.K.'s economy contracted in the
fourth quarter. Expectations were for a modest expansion.
This initially sent the euro lower against the dollar, although the common currency later recovered. Most
commodities tend to move in the opposite direction from the dollar.
Gold wasn't immune to the selloff, hitting a three-month low of $1,332.30 an ounce, down $12.20.
In focus was the first Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the year, which began Tuesday and is set
to end Wednesday. There are concerns among commodity analysts that the Fed may address inflation
fears, which some view as a muted hint at monetary tightening.
"A lot of people are taking some money off the board to wait and see," said Jimmy Tintle, analyst and broker
with Transworld Futures.
Oil futures fell 1.9% to an eight-week low of $86.19 a barrel. Comments from Saudi Arabia's oil minister on
Monday suggested the country may be prepared to increase output.

Markets Relearn Fundamentals

Markets Relearn Fundamentals

Greed and fear no longer seem to be playing such a violent game of tug-of-war with markets.
After a long stretch in which macroeconomic hopes and fears dictated the rise and fall of stocks, bonds and
commodities -- known in the market as the risk-on, risk-off trade -- there are tentative signs that more
traditional concerns are reasserting their power.
In recent weeks, moves in stocks and the U.S. dollar have had little connection, a breakdown of the trend
during much of 2010, when they were virtual mirror images of each other. Stocks were considered risky and
would rise when investors were feeling confident, while the dollar was a haven, benefiting when investors
were worried.
Commodities, too, have broken away from rising and falling with risk perceptions. Now more old-fashioned
concerns, like the weather, are having an impact. Corn, soybean and wheat prices jumped this month after
supply estimates were cut because of dry weather in South America and floods in Australia.
That could be a relief to investors frustrated by what they see as a market often detached from fundamental
concerns, thwarting efforts to make long-term trades.
"When risk recedes as a driver of returns, then fundamentals can become more of a driver," said Joseph
Mezrich, quantitative research analyst at Nomura Securities. "What you want is risk not being the driver --
good or bad." He and other analysts warn that markets are still a long way from running entirely on
fundamentals. Many of the factors that have fostered the market's unusual relationships, also known as
"correlations," since the financial crisis are still in place and might retreat only slowly, if at all.
The nonstop, frenetic interplay of asset classes across global markets defies simplistic analysis, and defining
a "normal" market is a fool's errand anyway. Longstanding relationships form and break down suddenly and
for any number of reasons in the best of times.
And the liquidity being pumped into the financial system by the Federal Reserve is a force that could warp
markets for months to come.
"The clearest divide between where markets have been and where they go will be when the Fed starts
tightening," said Alan Ruskin, global head of G-10 foreign-exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York.
"That will precipitate a very different thought process."
Still, many analysts say there are early signs that some of the unusually strong correlations that took root
amid the rolling financial crises of recent years may be breaking down.
Stocks and the dollar may be one of the clearest hints of creeping normalcy.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the dollar, valued against a basket of key trading partners'
currencies, have moved in similar directions less than 10% of the time in recent trading days, according to an
analysis by Nomura currency strategist Jens Nordvig. In technical terms, this means they have a correlation
coefficient of roughly 0.1.
A correlation of 1.0 between two assets means they move in the same direction 100% of the time. A
correlation of -1.0 means they move in the opposite direction 100% of the time.
For much of last autumn, the correlation of the dollar and the stock market often approached -1.0, meaning
the dollar was almost always falling when stocks were rising, and vice versa.

--- Page 165 ---
Page 165 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
For much of the past month, that correlation has been close to zero, meaning the relationship between stocks
and the dollar has been, practically speaking, almost nonexistent.
This seems to be happening partly because investors are no longer using the dollar as a proxy for their risk
appetite. On a "risk on" day, the dollar would decline as investors bought the euro, stocks, commodities and
other risky assets. When the prevailing attitude was "risk off," the dollar would rise as investors plowed into
the safety of Treasurys. That binary choice is no longer being made.
Similarly, the correlation between individual stock-market sectors has fallen recently to 78%, its lowest level in
nearly two years, from a peak above 90% last year, according to Brown Brothers Harriman market strategist
Charles Blood. "This suggests a weakening of the 'macro' market environment," Mr. Blood told clients in a
note last week.
Meanwhile, gold and U.S. stock prices are no longer moving in the same direction, as they did for most of the
second half of 2010. Their correlation has turned negative recently, with gold mostly falling as stocks rise.
Gold and Treasurys, which also moved together at times last year, have been unconnected lately.
There are many possible explanations for the gold-stock breakup. One could be that gold bugs are starting
to see the balance of monetary policy in the world moving away from easy money to tighter money.
This is especially clear in emerging markets, where policy makers from China to Brazil have been trying to
slow their runaway growth amid signs of rising inflation.
Emerging-market stocks and U.S. stocks are still mostly in harmony, as are U.S. stocks and commodities. But
those relationships could weaken if U.S. policy stays loose and emerging markets keep tightening.
"One of the key themes for 2011 is that global growth is not created equally, and not all economic cycles are
at the same point," said Gregory Peters, global director of fixed-income research at Morgan Stanley.
"Emerging markets are much more in middle to later cycles, while developed markets are still very much in
the early cycle."
The recent return of individual-investor, or retail, money to the U.S. stock market might also help lower
correlations between stocks and other assets, and among stock sectors, suggests Douglas Cliggott, U.S.
equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group.
Mutual-fund investors, who avoided putting new money to work in the stock market for about two years after
the crisis, tend to move more slowly than hedge-fund investors. They might be less likely to yank their money
out of the market in droves, unlike pack-traveling hedge funds.

Jan. 17-21
U.S.
-- Federal agents conducted their largest roundup ever of suspected mob members and associates, charging
127 people in the Northeast with crimes ranging from execution-style slayings to illegal card games. The
sweep, of suspects with nicknames like Tony Bagels, Jimmy Gooch and Jack the Whack, comes years after
the Mafia was all but declared dead. Jeffrey Lichtman, a well-known defense attorney, scorned the bust,
saying, "When you peel back the first page of the indictment, you see lots of junk from the '80s and '90s."
-- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords left the hospital less than two weeks after the Tucson rampage in which she was
shot in the head at close range. The Arizona Democrat is showing encouraging progress but faces a long and
arduous rehabilitation, with uncertain prospects.
-- The sole U.S. maker of a key drug used in capital punishment will halt production of the drug.
-- A rare larynx transplant has restored the voice of a woman unable to speak on her own for more than a
decade.
-- Bedbugs are rapidly evolving to withstand the pesticides used to combat them, according to the first
comprehensive genetic study of the awful critters. The findings come at a time of antibiotic-resistant infections
and herbicide-resistant weeds.
---
Politics
-- The Republican-led House voted to repeal Obama's signature health-care overhaul. The largely symbolic
move could nonetheless kick-start substantive changes to the law's provisions, including taxes levied on
insurers and penalties for uninsured Americans. House Republicans prepared for a vote next Tuesday -- just
ahead of the State of the Union -- to cut spending to 2008 levels, though they are divided on the time frame.
A drive to overhaul the tax code got off to a brisk start when the Business Roundtable threw its weight behind
the effort.
-- Obama ordered government agencies to review hundreds of federal regulations and make sure they aren't
stopping businesses from growing and hiring, as he sought to build support among employers and pre-empt
Republican attacks. Business leaders say an explosion in new rules for the health-care and financial
regulatory overhauls has helped keep them from expanding. In another effort to mend fences with Main
Street, Obama announced that GE chief Immelt would head a new White House board to create jobs.
-- Obama's approval rating climbed to 53%, up eight percentage points from December, as more Americans
come to see the president as a political moderate, according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
---
World
-- Chinese President Hu got a mixed reception on his Washington visit, as he and Obama played up the two
nations' common interests and soft-pedaled the longstanding issues that divide them. That uneasy balance is
emerging as the operating principle of the globe's most important bilateral relationship, though U.S.
lawmakers pressed Hu on sensitive issues ranging from trade policies to human-rights abuses. The diverging
paths of the two giants were clear as Beijing reported economic growth of 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010,
making it all but certain that China passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy.

-- Newly elected Afghan lawmakers said they planned to convene the country's parliament on Sunday,
defying President Karzai's order and throwing the country into a constitutional crisis. They said a special court
Karzai created to probe electoral fraud allegations is illegitimate.
-- Spain plans to pour billions more euros into its troubled savings banks and force them to be more open
about their lending practices as it strives to ward off an international bailout. The banks' fate is inextricably
tied to that of Spain and, potentially, to the euro itself.
-- Duvalier's surprise return threatened to further destabilize Haiti's already chaotic politics and complicate its
efforts to recover from a devastating earthquake, a cholera epidemic and violently contested elections.
-- A Tunisian prosecutor opened an investigation into the overseas assets of ousted President Ben Ali and his
family, as the caretaker government granted recognition to all banned political groups and adopted an
amnesty for all political prisoners.
-- Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi denied prosecutors' claims that he abused his powers to cover up alleged
sexual relations with an underage woman. Parliament now must decide whether to authorize prosecutors to
search the premier's Milan offices.
---
Business
-- It was a week of tectonic shifts in Silicon Valley. Google named co-founder Page to succeed longtime CEO
Schmidt, and Apple disclosed that CEO Jobs had gone on medical leave for unspecified health reasons,
raising doubts about Jobs and the company's future. Google's was the biggest management shake-up since
the Internet search giant was an obscure start-up. Schmidt, who has shared power with Page and co-founder
Brin, takes up the new post of executive chairman in April. The move changes the face of one of the world's
largest tech companies and comes as a new generation of founder-CEOs has risen in the Valley, including
Facebook's Zuckerberg. Apple posted a 78% surge in profit and record sales of its gadgets for the holiday
quarter.
-- Hewlett-Packard is overhauling its board, with four directors closely involved in the decision to oust former
chief executive Hurd departing as five new directors, including former eBay CEO Whitman, take their places.
-- General Electric said its outlook continued to improve as the company beat expectations with a 51%
increase in fourth-quarter profit and secured its highest level of orders since 2007, after restructuring its
sprawling industrial and financial portfolio. GE signaled a possible return to revenue growth of up to 5% in
2011.
-- A Paris court found former Vivendi top executives Messier and Bronfman guilty of criminal charges related
to the French media conglomerate's near-bankruptcy in 2002. The verdict ends an eight-year investigation
and trial involving one of the most sensational corporate downfalls in recent European history.
-- Warner Music Group enlisted Goldman Sachs to seek buyers for part or all of its business, a process that
could lead to the sale or breakup of the world's third-largest music company, even as it pursues an acquisition
of competitor EMI Group.
-- Two men were arrested for allegedly hacking into AT&T's website to gather the email addresses of about
120,000 users of Apple's iPad, including corporate chiefs, U.S. government officials and prominent media
figures.
-- Agribusiness giant Cargill plans to give up its majority stake in fertilizer company Mosaic in a transaction
valued at about $24.3 billion. The move could make Mosaic, a leading seller of potash and phosphate, a
more attractive takeover target.
-- Federal regulators signed off on Comcast's bid to control NBC Universal, imposing an array of conditions
aimed at preventing the cable giant from hindering competitors.
---
Markets
-- Danielle Chiesi, a key figure in the Galleon case, pleaded guilty to securities-fraud charges. The
government said Chiesi was a key conduit for market-moving, inside information that helped make Galleon
Group founder Raj Rajaratnam a hedge-fund star. The plea adds to pressure on Rajaratnam in what has
become the largest insider-trading case in a generation.

-- Blue-chip stocks rose for an eighth week in a row amid largely encouraging early earnings reports. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 84.46 points, or 0.7%, for the week to 11871.84. The 10-year Treasury
fell, raising its yield to 3.413% from 3.334% a week earlier. The euro rose to a two-month high against the
dollar on Friday.
-- Goldman Sachs slammed the door on U.S. clients hoping to invest in a private offering of shares in
Facebook. It said the media spotlight put the deal in danger of violating U.S. securities laws. The change-up
could damage Goldman's ties to some of its most lucrative clients.
-- Want to buy a piece of a bailout insurer? The Treasury Department and American International Group
picked the four Wall Street banks to jointly lead their first large offering of AIG shares in the coming months
for a cut-rate fee. The winners: J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.
-- It's easy to take gold for granted. Its price has risen in each of the past 10 years and hit an all-time high of
$1,422.60 on Jan. 3. Yet gold has fallen 5.7% since that record, amid worries China will act to cool its red-hot
economy by raising interest rates. That would further drain liquidity from the market and hurt zero-yield
investments such as the yellow metal.

In the recession and recovery, Americans have reached deeper into their savings than at any point in the past

withdrawal. To some extent, people are acting exactly as policy makers want them to. By holding interest
rates near zero, the Federal Reserve is creating an incentive to spend rather than save -- or to "save" in a
different way, by paying down expensive debt. In the longer term, though, Americans will need to do more
old-fashioned saving as well. The less money they have for a rainy day, the more vulnerable they will be.

From China, Signs That Gold's Rally Isn't Endless

From China, Signs That Gold's Rally Isn't Endless

The precious-metals selloff accelerated on Thursday amid worries the rally of the past few years may be
petering out and concerns that China will slam the brakes on its economy.
Heartening numbers on the U.S. economy on Thursday also tarnished demand for gold as a safe haven
investment. On Thursday, gold for January delivery fell 1.7% to $1,346.50 per troy ounce, the lowest level in
more than two months. Gold is down 5% for the year. Silver, whose swings are often more exaggerated than
gold, dropped 4.6% and is down 11% this year.
Until recently, gold and its precious-metal brethren have been the main beneficiaries of economic uncertainty
and low interest rates that central banks have maintained to stimulate growth. Gold found demand from
investors of all beliefs - those fearing an economic Armageddon and those worrying the economy will recover
too quickly, spurring inflation.
But investors are now looking to China, where prices are rising rapidly, sparking worries that the government
may hike interest rates sharply to stifle demand. As well, the prospect of the Federal Reserve pulling back
from its stimulus policies this year and withdrawing liquidity from the financial system, is reducing demand for
gold, and dimming inflation fears.
And gold's strength -- it rose 30% in 2010 alone -- has caused some fund managers to become skeptical of
its ability to rise much further.
Dennis Gartman, a hedge-fund manager and author of the Gartman Letter, has sold two-thirds of his gold
holdings over the past few weeks. On Thursday, he said he sold because of "the fact that it wasn't making
new highs and that the market was a little too crowded."
"Everywhere you went, everyone you knew was aggressive long," he added. "That's a bad sign, because that
means everybody has already bought."
Since Dec. 31, investors have redeemed 29.3 metric tons of gold from SPDR Gold Shares, the world's
largest gold-backed, exchange-traded fund, reflecting the shift in sentiment.
The futures market also is flashing warning signs. Bullish bets by financial investors in New York's Comex
market are down 32% since early October, according to Tom Pawlicki, an analyst at MF Global, in a research
note.
In the options pit, meanwhile, put options -- bets that prices will fall -- are more expensive than call options,
bets that prices will rise, another sign of investors turning nervous about a near-term price correction.
Investor interest could be further limited. On Thursday, CME Group, which operates exchanges, raised
margin requirements on gold, silver and some other commodities, making it more expensive to trade them.
What isn't clear is whether the recent decline signals that an end to gold's decadelong rally is in sight, or
whether it is merely a pause that will soon be followed by another price rise. Gold has had numerous
short-term drops in recent years, but has risen each of the past 10 years, including a 29.8% gain last year.
However, the sentiment has moved recently, as the U.S. and Europe both surprised markets with
better-than-expected economic data.
The mood swing culminated Thursday as the U.S. reported a sharp drop in new jobless claims for last week,
and China said its economic expansion accelerated in the fourth quarter despite efforts to slow growth.

Though many remain skeptical that the U.S. economy will be strong enough to warrant an increase in
interest rates, the market is increasingly betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve will stop pumping new
stimulus into the economy, a policy that fueled interest in gold as a hedge against currency devaluation.
Meanwhile, growing inflationary pressure in China has fueled concerns about further government moves to
combat rising prices.
On Thursday, China said its December consumer price index rose 4.6% from a year ago, above Beijing's
official target, though slightly below November's figure. Strong economic growth has given the government
more leeway to raise banks' capital requirements or hike interest rates, which will further drain liquidity from
the market and hurt zero-yield investments such as gold.
Worries that China may stamp on the brakes hurt commodities of all stripes on Thursday. Oil and copper both
dropped 2.2%. Gold can be a leading indicator for the rest of the commodities market, and its declines have
outpaced those other commodities this year.
Reduced concern about the economy "have lessened the safe-haven demand for gold, which is often
viewed as a form of insurance policy," said Anne-Laure Tremblay, a precious-metal analyst with BNP Paribas.
Some investors who have pulled back nonetheless retain significant gold investments. In November, Charles
Morris, who runs HSBC's $2.5 billion Absolute Return Fund, told investors he had halved the fund's bullion
stake to 6%. He said in a note to investors that the move reflected "the fact that we remain bullish over the
long term."
But he also noted that gold has risen in tandem with other risky assets, and so "the diversification benefits
have become less obvious."
Investors who were along for the ride now may be more willing to invest in stocks, which have also been
rising, which may further tarnish gold's luster.
"While we think this is unlikely to be a definitive turning point, we do think that gold will underperform in the
commodities space," analysts at Macquarie wrote in a recent note.
Still, "the smoke signals are pretty ominous" for investors with overweight positions in gold, said Jon Nadler,
an analyst at Kitco Metals Inc., a bullion dealer. "It's not the end of the world, but it certainly presents some
rhetorical question marks to those who said it can only go up."

World News: Vietnamese Premier Is Poised for New Term
World News: Vietnamese Premier Is Poised for New Term

HANOI -- Vietnam's Communist Party reappointed Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to its elite Politburo at a
secretive congress Wednesday, paving the way for the nation's top leader to serve a second term.
The decision of the party's 175-person Central Committee to reappoint the 61-year-old Mr. Dung -- whose
second term as premier requires confirmation by the country's National Assembly in May -- indicates Vietnam
will likely continue its pro-growth policies, political analysts say.
In recent years, that has meant plowing billions of dollars into subsidizing lending programs and other
state-driven spending plans to maintain rapid expansion despite double-digit inflation rates.
Across much of Asia, inflation has spurred fears about whether government efforts to prevent sudden price
rises will stunt regional growth, which has helped drive the global recovery.
Vietnam presents a troubling vision of what can happen if policy makers fail to put on the brakes in time.
Inflation rates steadily increased in 2010, hitting 11.75% on year in December, and worsening a crisis of
confidence in the currency, the dong, which already had been hit by a series of devaluations.
Vietnamese have responded by buying up dollars and hoarding gold, or speculating on land in the hope of
retaining their savings. Private businesses, have struggled to compete with powerful state-owned enterprises
for bank loans as policy makers belatedly try to slow credit growth, which expanded more than 27% last year.
"It's difficult getting credit, but with some new faces in government, hopefully the problems can be resolved,"
says Vu Quyet Thang, who runs a travel company in Hanoi.
Not much seems to be changing, though. The Communist Party's conclave is a grand event held every five
years, and the outcome is largely prearranged, people familiar with its workings say. This time the party
appointed its chief Marxist theorist and head of the national legislature, Nguyen Phu Trong, as the party's new
boss -- a move analysts said would strengthen Mr. Dung's hand.
Another candidate for party boss, Truong Tan Sang, who is widely perceived as one of Mr. Dung's main
rivals, was expected to move to the largely ceremonial post of president.
Mr. Dung's and Mr. Sang's positions will likely be confirmed by the rubber-stamp National Assembly in May.

Inflated Expectations in the Gold Trade

Inflated Expectations in the Gold Trade

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Anyone telling you gold is a great hedge against inflation likely never owned it during the 25 years beginning
in 1980: Gold's price sank by a fifth even as the consumer price index more than doubled.
This apparent paradox is a reminder that gold's identity is amorphous. It is seen variously as an inflation or
dollar hedge; a bet on supply and demand; or insurance against Armageddon. Amid food and fuel-price
increases, it is reasonable to assume fears of monetary debasement and inflation now dominate. And with
the Federal Reserve buying bonds, gold should keep rising.
But what if inflation isn't gold's friend? Since Lehman Brothers folded, gold has been inversely correlated
with real U.S. interest rates by a factor of 81%. That is far higher than gold's 19% correlation with the CPI or
10% inverse correlation with the dollar index.
The relationship with real rates, which subtract expected inflation from 10-year Treasury yields, makes
sense. Fed policy aims to cut Treasury yields to boost risk appetite. Gold's negative yield, after storage costs,
is relatively less onerous when Treasury yields move toward zero. Real interest rates plunged to less than
0.5% in October, just before gold broke through $1,400.
Therein lies a warning for gold buyers. Say inflationary pressure causes the Fed to stop buying bonds and
real rates rise. Gold's negative yield would weigh more heavily on it, perhaps sparking a sell-off.
The Fed's stomach for fighting inflation is questionable in such a leveraged economy. But don't forget that
the last time it surprised on this score, in the early 1980s, it helped trigger gold's long spell in the wilderness.

The Latest American Export: Inflation

What do the years 1971, 2003 and 2010 have in common? In each year, low U.S. interest rates and the
expectation of dollar depreciation led to massive "hot" money outflows from the U.S. and world-wide inflation.
And in all three cases, foreign central banks intervened heavily to buy dollars to prevent their currencies from
appreciating.
When central banks issue base money to buy dollars, domestic interest rates are forced down and domestic
inflationary pressure is generated. Primary commodity prices go up quickly because speculators can easily
bid for long positions in organized commodity futures markets when interest rates are low.
The world saw a surge in the dollar prices of primary commodity prices in 1971-73 following the Nixon shock
of 1971 when the U.S. abandoned the gold standard. There was also a commodity price surge during the
Greenspan-Bernanke shock of 2003-04, when the federal-funds rate was reduced to an unprecedented low
of 1% followed by a falling dollar.
Now we have what one might call the Bernanke shock. The Fed has set U.S. short-term interest rates at
essentially zero since September 2008, followed in 2010 by quantitative easing to drive down long-term rates.
Predictably, primary commodity prices in 2009-10 surged. In 2010 alone, all items in the Economist's dollar
commodity price index rose 33.5%, while the industrial raw materials component soared a remarkable
37.4.%.
The longer-term inflationary and economic consequences over the next decade of this most recent U.S. loose
money shock remain to be seen. But we can glean useful hints by looking at the aftermaths of the two earlier
shocks. In the 1970s, "stagflation" (inflation combined with cyclical bouts of unemployment and wide swings
in exchange rates) seemed intractable. Productivity growth in mature industrial countries fell sharply.
In the early 1980s, a necessary but savage disinflationary policy was instituted. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker
imposed extremely high interest rates (the fed-funds rate touched 22% in July 1981), and he ultimately
succeeded in killing stagflation. With credibility in America's long-run monetary policy restored, hot money,
which had flowed out in the inflationary 1970s, came back with a vengeance. The dollar soared in the
foreign-exchange markets and became extremely overvalued by the end of 1984.
To prevent even more precipitous depreciations of their currencies, foreign central banks were forced to sell
dollars and let their domestic money supplies contract. At the storm's center, the combination of high interest
rates, an overvalued dollar, and large fiscal deficits caused a sharp increase in the U.S. trade deficit -- mainly
in manufactures. The upshot was the world-wide recession of 1982-83 and the creation of America's "rust
belt," particularly in the industrial Midwest.
The Greenspan-Bernanke interest rate shock of 2003-04, followed by a weakening dollar into the first half of
2008, created the bubble economy. Primary commodity prices began rising significantly in 2003-04, then
flattened out before spiking in 2007 into the first half of 2008.
But the biggest bubble was in real estate, both commercial and residential. With low mortgage rates and no
restraining regulation on mortgage quality, average U.S. home prices rose more than 50% from the beginning
of 2003 to the middle of 2006. This led to an unsustainable building boom -- with echoes around the world in
countries such as the U.K, Spain and Ireland. The bubbles in primary commodity prices collapsed mainly in
the second half of 2008. But the residue of bad debts, particularly ongoing mortgage defaults, led to the
banking crisis and global downturn of 2008-09.
So what lessons can we draw from these episodes of U.S. easy money and a weak dollar for the stability of
the American economy itself?

First, sharp general price increases in auction-market goods such as primary commodities or foreign
exchange (i.e., a weakening dollar) is an early warning sign that the Fed is being too easy -- a warning that
the Fed is again ignoring as we enter 2011.
Second, beyond the rise in primary commodity prices, general price inflation in the U.S. only comes with
long and variable lags. After the U.S. monetary shock, hot money flows into countries on the dollar standard's
periphery cause a loss of monetary control and general inflation to show up there more quickly than in the
U.S.
In 2010, consumer price indexes shot up more than 5% in major emerging markets such as China, Brazil and
Indonesia, while the consumer price index in the U.S. itself rose only 1.2%. Similarly, after the Nixon shock of
1971, there was much more explosive inflation in Japan in 1972-73 than in the U.S. But by December 1979,
inflation in America's producer and consumer price indexes was more than 13%.
The U.S. is a sovereign country that has the right to follow its own monetary policy. By an accident of
history, however, since 1945 it is also the center of the world dollar standard -- which remains surprisingly
robust to the present day. So the choice of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve can strongly affect its
neighbors for better or for worse.
Beginning with the Nixon shock in 1971, American policy makers have frequently ignored foreign complaints.
But by ignoring inflationary early warning signs on the dollar standard's periphery, which in turn lead to rising
domestic prices and asset bubbles, the Fed has made both the world and American economies much less
stable.

New Prize in Cold War: Cuban Doctors

Felix Ramirez slipped into an Internet cafe in the West African nation of The Gambia, scoured the Web for
contact information for U.S. diplomats, then phoned the U.S. embassy in Banjul, the capital.
He told the receptionist he was an American tourist who had lost his passport, and asked to speak to the visa
section. As he waited to be connected, he practiced his script: "I am a Cuban doctor looking to go to America.
When can we meet?"
Dr. Ramirez says he was told to go to a crowded Banjul supermarket and to look for a blond woman in a
green dress -- an American consular official. They circled one another a few times, then began to talk.
That furtive meeting in September 2008 began a journey for the 37-year-old surgeon that ended in May 2009
in Miami, where he became a legal refugee with a shot at citizenship.
Dr. Ramirez is part of a wave of Cubans who have defected to the U.S. since 2006 under the little-known
Cuban Medical Professional Parole immigration program, which allows Cuban doctors and some other health
workers who are serving their government overseas to enter the U.S. immediately as refugees. Data released
to The Wall Street Journal under the Freedom of Information Act shows that, through Dec. 16, 1,574 CMPP
visas have been issued by U.S. consulates in 65 countries.
Cuba has been sending medical "brigades" to foreign countries since 1973, helping it to win friends abroad,
to back "revolutionary" regimes in places like Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua, and perhaps most importantly,
to earn hard currency. Communist Party newspaper Granma reported in June that Cuba had 37,041 doctors
and other health workers in 77 countries. Estimates of what Cuba earns from its medical teams -- revenue
that Cuba's central bank counts as "exports of services" -- vary widely, running to as much as $8 billion a
year. Many Cubans complain that the brigades have undermined Cuba's ability to maintain a high standard of
health care at home.
The U.S. immigration initiative is reminiscent of the sort of gamesmanship that was common during the Cold
War. It has interfered with Cuba's program by triggering defections of Cuban medical personnel all over the
globe -- an average of one a day since the U.S. countermeasure began in 2006. Cuba generally doesn't
include doctors among the 20,000 or more Cubans it authorizes to immigrate to the U.S. each year.
State Department officials say it isn't the intention of the U.S. government to use the immigration program,
known as CMPP, to engage in espionage or to disrupt medical missions. Cuban doctors, a State Department
spokesman says, "are often denied exit permission by the Cuban government to come to the U.S. when they
qualify under other established legal channels." One goal of CMPP is to get Cuba to change that.
CMPP was the brainchild of Cuba-born diplomat Emilio Gonzalez, director of the U.S. Citizen & Immigration
Services from 2006 to 2008. A former colonel in the U.S. Army, Mr. Gonzalez is a staunchly anti-Castro exile.
He has characterized Cuba's policy of sending doctors and other health workers abroad as "state-sponsored
human trafficking." The Cuban doctors, he says, work directly for health authorities in other countries and
have no say in their assignments, salaries, hours or work conditions.
Cuban doctors themselves regard such overseas assignments differently. Their salaries in Cuba top out at
about $25 a month. When serving overseas, they get their Cuban salaries, plus a $50-per-month stipend --
both paid to their dependents while they're abroad, according to Cuban doctors interviewed for this story. In
addition, they earn overseas salaries -- from $150 to $1,000 a month, depending on the mission, the doctors
say.
"In Haiti they paid us $300 a month, in gourdes, the Haitian money," says one former overseas doctor who is
now back in Cuba. "I converted my salary, and lived fine on $100 per month." With her savings, she says, she
bought a television and laptop computer, items she couldn't have gotten in Cuba.

Ramon Gonzalez, a defector who served on medical missions to Ghana and Gambia, says Cubans'
entrepreneurial instincts make for almost unlimited profit opportunities. "You go to the African flea market and
buy a bathing suit from the U.S., anything with a Speedo or a Nike label. It's like 45 cents in Africa," he says.
"You sell it for $5 in Cuba."
An even more lucrative sideline, he says: private medical practice, including abortions. Dr. Gonzalez says
performing abortions can be a gold mine for Cubans, particularly in the Middle Eastern nations that pay the
best salaries.
"The vast majority of Cuban doctors fight to get onto a mission because they can accumulate thousands of
dollars," says Dr. Darsi Ferrer Ramirez, director of the antigovernment group Juan Bruno Zayas Center of
Health and Human Rights in Havana.
The 41-year-old dissident says the program is rife with corruption. "It's known that to get to the better
countries -- we're speaking of South Africa, Brazil -- there are functionaries who will take money under the
table. It costs between $500 and $1,000," he says.
Juan Bautista Palay, chief of physical therapy at Havana's 10 de Octubre Hospital, acknowledges that money
is what draws colleagues abroad. "You'd go, too, if you could triple your pay," he says. He denies anyone
from his facility has paid bribes to serve abroad.
The U.S. immigration program gives Cuban doctors yet another reason to serve abroad: a way to resettle in
the U.S. Ordinary Cubans seeking asylum must reach American shores before applying. Under CMPP,
Cuban doctors can do so from U.S. embassies anywhere in the world.
Of the nearly 1,600 defections through Dec. 16, more than 800 health workers have defected from Venezuela
alone, and nearly 300 have come from Colombia and Curacao, which don't host Cuban medical brigades but
are easily reached from Venezuela. Another 135 have come from four other countries: Bolivia, Guatemala,
Namibia and Peru. Others have showed up to defect in such far-flung locales as Qatar, Fiji, Djibouti and
Mauritius.
Dr. Ramirez's odyssey began when he was selected for a two-year posting to Gambia. Cuban doctors there
are at the pinnacle of the public-health community, teaching in medical colleges and running hospitals. Dr.
Ramirez says his aim from the start was to use CMPP to defect. He says he kept his plan secret from his wife
and parents, who stayed behind when he left Cuba in 2008.
Dr. Ramirez was assigned to run the surgery unit at the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in Banjul. When he
arrived in the country to join a 138-person Cuban delegation, he surrendered his passport to security
personnel at Cuba's embassy. Cuban doctors also had to turn over other identification documents like driver
licenses, Dr. Ramirez says, to hinder any attempt to satisfy U.S. diplomats of their bona fides as defectors.
He kept his.
"We had to get cellphones, too, so they always could find us," he says. Dr. Ramirez bought two cheap
phones -- one to talk with his bosses, the other to plot his escape.
His meeting with the U.S. consular officer at the Banjul supermarket set his plan in motion. Mr. Ramirez says
he was able to persuade the officer -- he says her name was Wendy Kennedy -- that he was a Cuban doctor
working in the country. Their next meeting was at the hospital, he says, where Ms. Kennedy conducted a
formal interview to prepare his asylum request.
The State Department declined to make Ms. Kennedy available for comment, but confirmed some details of
Dr. Ramirez's account, including that Ms. Kennedy worked in Gambia at the time of his asylum application.
Dr. Ramirez had to wait months before learning whether he would be granted asylum. He got the news in
May 2009 via cellphone. Ironically, he says, he was at an emergency meeting called by his brigade
coordinator to discuss two Cubans who had just abandoned their mission and fled to neighboring Senegal.
"They called us in to warn us not to try to flee, or else our families in Cuba would be punished," he recalls.
Getting a U.S. visa was one thing, but getting out of Gambia was another thing altogether. His Cuban
superiors had his passport, and trying to get out by air would likely attract the attention of Gambian
authorities, who would alert the Cubans. He figured he had to get to Senegal.
There was no one to trust among his fellow expatriates, he says. He felt like a prisoner in the home he shared
with four other Cubans. "There's always one who is the informer," he says. He needed permission from a
brigade coordinator even to visit an African colleague's home for dinner.

He had befriended a Lebanese merchant who was a patient. The merchant connected him with a smuggler,
who agreed to take him to Senegal for $500.
Dr. Ramirez left the night after his asylum request was approved, carrying documents from U.S. consular
officials in Banjul. In Senegal, he discovered five comrades from the Gambian mission who, unbeknownst to
him, also had been plotting their escape. At the airport, he showed airline officials his U.S. entry documents
and was allowed to board a flight to Spain. When he arrived, a U.S. diplomat vouched for him so he could
board a flight to the U.S.
It is unclear how disruptive defections like Dr. Ramirez's are to Cuba's medical-mission program. Only a small
percentage of Cuban doctors sent overseas have actually defected, making it unlikely the program has put
much of a dent in revenues collected by Cuba.
Information about exactly how much Cuba makes from medical brigades is hard to come by. In many cases,
Cuba extracts a direct payment either from a host government or an international aid group. Individual Cuban
doctors are paid only a portion of what Cuba collects.
Since Hugo Chavez came to power in Venezuela in 1998, Cuba has been bartering doctors for Venezuelan
oil. The U.S. Energy Department estimates that Venezuela ships Cuba 90,000 barrels of oil a day -- worth
more than $2 billion a year at current prices. In addition, Venezuela pays Cuba for medical teams sent to
countries that Mr. Chavez considers part of Venezuela's "Bolivarian" sphere. Bolivia, Honduras, Ecuador and
Paraguay all use Cuban doctors paid for by Venezuela.
Germany, France and Japan, working through the Pan-American Health Organization, paid $400 per month
for each doctor sent to work in Honduras after a hurricane in 2005, according to the Honduran government.
Cuba's Public Health Ministry said in November: "As a principle, we have prioritized donating medical
brigades to countries with grave health problems and few resources and hard-to-reach settlements, where
local doctors refuse to work." It said that Cuba intends to send more doctors abroad, to nations better
prepared to pay for services. "In countries whose economy permits, we will increase the presence of our
professionals, with compensation," it said.
Julie Feinsilver, who tracks Cuba's medical diplomacy as a senior fellow of the Council on Hemispheric
Affairs in Washington, a think tank, says such arrangements benefit both Cuba and the host countries. "Do
you think that it is possible to hire doctors for less than $1,000 a month? The Cuban government does earn
money, albeit considerably less than others would for similar services."
By summer's end, Dr. Ramirez and the five other Cubans who defected with him from Gambia were all in
Miami. Four of them work as instructors at Dade Medical College. Dr. Ramirez is a surgical assistant at
Baptist Health South Florida's hospital in Homestead, Fla.
Dr. Ramirez's parents and wife -- and a son born shortly after he left for Africa, whom he has never seen --
remain in Cuba, in Camaguey. All of them are eligible for U.S. visas under the CMPP program, but there is
virtually no chance they'll get out soon. Dr. Ramirez says his wife lost her job at a hospital because of his
defection.
"They're blacklisted for five years, minimum," Dr. Ramirez says. "I'm a traitor to the homeland now."

Gold Prices Shed Nearly 2%, Falling to Seven-Week Low

Gold Prices Shed Nearly 2%, Falling to Seven-Week Low

NEW YORK -- Gold futures skidded to a seven-week low on Friday as stability in broader markets
weakened the yellow metal's safe-haven allure.
Gold for January delivery lost $26.50, or 1.9%, to end at $1,360.40 an ounce on the Comex division of the
New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the lowest settlement price since Nov. 22.
The more actively traded February contract experienced a similar decline to settle at $1,360.50 an ounce on
Nymex.
Gold's decline doesn't signal a deeper selloff, traders said. Instead, the precious metal is expected to stay
between $1,350 and $1,430 an ounce. Gold lacks a stronger direction because investors are vacillating
between fear and optimism about the global economy.
"The market needs some fresh, scary news to drive it higher," said Ralph Preston, market analyst at Heritage
West Financial. "All the bad news has already been baked into the cake."
After hitting its record settlement of $1,422.60 an ounce on Jan. 3, gold has pulled back as investors have
preferred riskier assets like stocks. However, investors remain cautious, and gold prices still move higher
even when market sentiment gets slightly jittery.
Comex March silver fell 0.9%, Nymex April platinum shed 0.3% and Nymex March palladium eased 2.8%.

NEW YORK -- Stocks fell for the first time in three days as materials shares sagged in the wake of
disappointing economic data.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 23.54 points, or 0.20%, at 11731.90. Merck was the
measure's worst performer, accounting for 19 points of the Dow's decline.
The drug maker sank $2.46, or 6.6%, to 34.69, after researchers halted one of two major studies of its
anticlotting drug vorapaxar and made significant changes to the other, throwing into doubt the future of one of
the most important medicines in its product pipeline.
The Nasdaq Composite edged down 2.04, or 0.07%, to 2735.29. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell
2.20, or 0.17%, to 1283.76.
Materials shares fell as metals prices weakened. Alcoa shed 49 cents, or 3%, to 15.75, and Newmont Mining
fell 98 cents, or 1.7%, to 56.81. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 3.77, or 3.1%, to 118.07, after
unionized workers at copper mining company Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde SAA, which is controlled by
Freeport-McMoRan, prepared to begin striking Friday.
The Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing for initial jobless claims unexpectedly
increased by 35,000 to 445,000 in the week ended Jan. 8. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires
had expected a drop of 2,000 to 407,000. However, investors noted that the data could have been affected by
the recent snowstorms.
"Claims are going in the right direction, they just aren't going fast enough," said Jerry Harris, president of
asset management at Sterne Agee.
Separately, U.S. producer prices jumped in December, rising a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in December from
November. However, stripping out volatile food and energy items, producer prices increased 0.2%.
Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires were expecting a 0.8% increase in the overall figure. The core
index of producer prices came in line with forecasts. The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed for the
third consecutive month in November, though the gap with China rebounded.
Investors also were waiting to see the results of chip giant Intel's fourth-quarter earnings.
"They make some very useful comments that will give us some insight into what current [information
technology] spending demands are," said Tom Wilson, managing director at Brinker Capital. Intel closed
down 0.1%.
Successful auctions of euro-zone debt continued to calm some of investors' worries over the precarious state
of the region's fiscal stability. The Spanish government sold 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in five-year bonds at
yields below those in the secondary market, though its borrowing costs rose compared to a November
auction. Italy also successfully sold bonds.
Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank left benchmark interest rates unchanged. ECB
President Jean-Claude Trichet said that the inflationary pressures in the euro area appeared to be short term.
Among stocks in focus, Marathon Oil rallied 2.45, or 6%, to 42.98, after the company's board approved
advancing plans to spin off the company's refining and sales operations. The split will see the creation of
Marathon Petroleum Corp., expected to be the fifth-largest U.S. refiner.
Printed-circuit-board maker TTM Technologies gained 3.12, or 21%, to 17.74, after raising its fourth-quarter
forecast, saying an increase in demand for its high technology products boosted its prospects.

Whole Foods Market rose 2.30, or 4.6%, to 52.31, after Jefferies reiterated a "buy" rating for the upscale
grocer and boosted its price target to $60 from $47. Jefferies said its postholiday checks were "quite strong."

Portugal's Debt Sale Helps Dow Rise 83.56

Portugal's Debt Sale Helps Dow Rise 83.56

Global investors drove up stock and commodities prices around the world, emboldened by a successful
Portuguese bond auction offering that offered hope Europe could ride through its latest debt woes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped at the opening bell, and finished with a gain of 83.56 points, or
0.72%, at 11755.44 for its second consecutive day of gains. The blue-chip index has added 1.5% so far this
month and is on track for its sixth consecutive week of gains. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 stock index
closed at its highest level in more than two years as stocks in Spain, Italy and Portugal surged. The euro
staged its biggest rally in a month, rising to $1.3133.
"Optimism is not in short supply," said Bob Jergovic, chief investment officer at CLS Investments. "I'm just
watching with amazement as the market churns higher."
As the dollar sank, commodities returned to record territory. Oil prices rushed to a two-year high, while U.S.
government warnings of global food supply shortages sent the prices of corn, soybeans and wheat higher.
Portugal's success in selling debt at yields that were lower than some investors had feared drove down the
cost of borrowing for fiscally stressed European nations. Yields on Portuguese, Spanish and Greek bonds all
dropped against benchmarks. In turn, Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts declined.
U.S.-listed shares of Spanish banks Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria gained 12%
each.
Bank shares also fared well in the U.S. as financials led the gains after Wells Fargo upgraded its assessment
of the banking sector. J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America were among the best performers.
Driving optimism was the Portuguese government auction, which sold 1.25 billion euros ($1.62 billion) in
bonds at yields that were below market expectations. The auction offered a dose of good news after days of
mounting concern over Portugal's finances, with investors fretting that economic growth could be stunted if
governments are forced to enact tougher austerity measures.
"In 10 months, we've had two major countries go to the brink, and we've gotten by -- somehow, a deal is
struck each time," said Christian Thwaites, chief executive of Sentinel Investments. "The market is feeling
that we're going to muddle through, even if it may not be very pretty."
Still, some investors are bracing for further problems in Europe.
"What they're doing with Portugal is an extension of what they did with Ireland and Greece -- they're not really
fixing the core problem, they're buying time," said Paul Simon, chief investment officer for Tactical Allocation
Group in Birmingham, Mich.
The market also was responding to another step up in U.S. import prices in December, rounding out their
biggest three-month gain in over a year on the back of resurgent energy prices.
The price of imported goods rose 1.1% in December, following an upwardly revised 1.5% increase in
November, versus an initial estimate of 1.3%. The numbers suggest that fears of inflation could begin to
creep into the market, ahead of producer and consumer price index numbers in the coming days.
"Clearly energy and food are going higher, and that's directly related to what's going on in the commodity
market," said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at Icap Corporates. "That's something to be concerned
about, with oil pretty close to $100 now . . . the public is feeling it a lot more right now than the Fed is willing
to admit right now."

Oil, Copper Go Higher
Copper jumped 1.5%, while oil added 0.8% to settle at $91.86 a barrel. Gold edged up as well.
Treasurys sold off, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note higher to 3.353%. Bond yields move
inversely to prices.
An auction of 10-year notes was well-received, with bids coming in at rates unseen since April.
Among stocks in focus, oil major Chevron gained 0.7% to 92.45 after saying late Tuesday that its
fourth-quarter earnings are expected to be higher than the profit reported in the preceding quarter.
American International Group fell 1.1% to 58.40 after the giant insurer decided to sell its Taiwan unit, Nan
Shan Life Insurance, to Taiwan's Ruen Chen Investment Holdings for $2.16 billion, another step forward in
the U.S. insurer's efforts to repay U.S. government bailout funds.
Shares of ITT surged 17% to 61.50 after the aerospace and defense firm said its board has backed a plan to
split the company into three publicly-traded companies.

BlackRock Gold ETF Wins Fans on Its Fees

Corrections & Amplifications
BlackRockInc.'s iShares Gold Trust fund charges a 0.25% annual management fee. A Jan. 13 article about
the fund incorrectly said the fee was monthly.
(WSJ February 4, 2011)
(END)
Investors eager to snap up gold worth millions of dollars are flocking to a fund where savings are measured
in fractions of a penny per share.
BlackRock Inc.'s iShares Gold Trust (trading symbol IAU) has boosted its physical gold holdings by 36.9% in
the six months since undercutting its competitors' management fees. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the oldest
and by far the biggest gold exchange-traded fund, saw its gold volume shrink by 3.6% over the same period.
"It's always hard to know why money goes in or out . . . but it's true that we've had good inflows since we've
made these changes," said BlackRock spokeswoman Christine Hudacko.
Investors have flocked to gold as a safe-harbor investment during periods of economic uncertainty and
inflation fears. The exchange-traded funds allow investors to benefit from rising gold prices without having to
transport, store or insure the metal. But with such a simple investment formula -- buy gold and hold it --
newer funds have found it difficult to escape SPDR Gold's shadow. Cutting management fees is one of the
only ways to stand out.
"There are some gaps in expense ratios between identical products that are wide enough to drive a truck
though them," said Michael Johnston, senior analyst at ETF Database, an online provider of ETF research.
BlackRock's fund charges a 0.25% monthly management fee, while the standard for SPDR Gold and many
other similar ETFs is 0.4%. A $10,000 investment in a gold ETF at the start of December would have been
valued at about $10,240 by the end of the month based on gold's performance. The iShares ETF would
charge that investor about $2.10 in management fees at the end of December, compared to around $3.40
charged by the GLD.
For multimillion-dollar investors in gold ETFs, every fee cut translates into thousands of dollars in savings.
The widely watched Soros Fund Management, founded by billionaire investor and philanthropist George
Soros, added a five-million-share stake in BlackRock's ETF in the third quarter, while cutting its SPDR Gold
holdings by over half a million units, to around 4.7 million shares.
On Dec. 14, BlackRock's ETF saw an influx of around $369 million, the equivalent of 270,000 troy ounces of
gold and the fund's biggest single-day inflow in five years.
"Where it starts to matter is for the hedge fund and for the institutional investor who has $100 million in the
gold ETF, where we're dealing with significant dollar amounts," Mr. Johnston said.
The savings also can add up for smaller investors who hold an ETF for many months.
However, SPDR Gold still dwarfs its competition, with $56.3 billion in assets, over 10 times the holdings of
BlackRock's gold ETF, the next largest.
"GLD remains the perfect choice for institutional and retail investors," said Marie McGehee, spokeswoman
with State Street Global Advisors, the marketing agent for SPDR Gold.

The SPDR Gold ETF has advantages over competitors with lower management fees, such as cheaper
transaction costs, said Tom Anderson, head of ETF Strategy and Research at State Street Corp. Each SPDR
Gold share buys 10 times as much gold as a unit of the iShares fund, so an investor would need to buy or
sell fewer shares of GLD. Those costs can add up for investors charged for each share traded by their broker
or platform, Mr. Anderson said.

Investors Get in a Lather Over Tech --- Echoes of Dot-Com Craze Reverberate as Money Pours in to Start-Ups; One Big Difference: Profits
Investors Get in a Lather Over Tech --- Echoes of Dot-Com Craze Reverberate as Money Pours in to
Start-Ups; One Big Difference: Profits

It may be only a few days into 2011, but tech investors seem to be partying like it's 1999.
Wall Street, facing a raft of regulation and slower growth ahead, has relatively little to get excited about these
days. But financiers and investors alike are casting their gaze back to Silicon Valley, in what is shaping up as
an echo of the dot-com craze that minted millionaires on both coasts over a decade ago.
As a reminder of those euphoric times, the technology-oriented Nasdaq-100 index on Monday surpassed its
2007 highs to put the measure at its highest point since February 2001, the waning days of the dot-com
bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, too, is within a hair's breadth of reclaiming the market peak it
reached in January 2000.
As investors show signs of warming to tech again, bankers have been racing to get there first, striking deals
with the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs driving the wave of innovation. This week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
led a $2 billion investment in Facebook Inc., the closely held social-networking company. That offering has
drawn a lot of interest.
The Facebook deal gives the company an implied value of $50 billion, five times its valuation in mid-2009 and
25 times revenue. Google Inc., by contrast, trades at a little over seven times revenue, about the same
valuation the search company fetched at the time of its IPO in August 2004.
Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said professional social-networking site LinkedIn Corp. moved
toward an initial public offering. Internet telephony company Skype also is working toward a public debut this
year. The daily deals website Groupon Inc. is raising $950 million, after already raising $175 million and
rejecting a $6 billion takeover offer from Google. The company also is preparing for a 2011 IPO, according to
people familiar with the matter.
Microblogging site Twitter Inc. said last month that it had raised $200 million in a funding that valued it at $3.7
billion, up from just $1 billion a year earlier.
The big money and heady valuations raise the question whether the miniboom in Internet companies may
presage a bust. Like the 1990s, some investors are buying in first and reading the fine print later, or not at all.
"Most sophisticated investment people think this is loony," said a Goldman client who has submitted a
request to participate in the Facebook deal without spending time analyzing the company's fundamentals. "I
think we are revisiting the 1998-1999 Internet mania."
Some said investor interest is different now. Most Web companies have something that was in scarce supply
in the bubble of the late 1990s: revenue and earnings. High valuations largely are confined to a small set of
Internet start-ups: Facebook, Twitter, Groupon and game company Zynga Inc. But they have amassed
millions of users world-wide that generate revenue.
"This isn't 1999," said Rory Driscoll, a venture capitalist at Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, Calif.
"Facebook is a singularity."
Another difference: Internet usage in the late 1990s still was in its relative infancy, especially broadband,
which hampered entertainment offerings like music and video. Today, broadband is more plentiful, and
smartphones are increasing access and usage.
Wall Street analysts aren't twisting themselves to justify heady valuations like they did during the dot-com
bubble, when it wasn't unheard of to value companies on what they spent, not what they earned.

Web retailer Pets.com, which raised more than $110 million in capital and went public in early 2000, spent
$25 million on ads featuring a ballad-singing sock puppet. But by late 2000, the San Francisco company,
which offered deep discounts while incurring high costs from shipping items like 20-pound bags of dog food,
was struggling. It closed in November that year.
But around San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, dozens of start-ups have sprung up in the orbit of
Twitter, Zynga and Yelp Inc. The race for good software engineers is heating up again, and enticements like
signing bonuses and free cafeterias are on the rise.
With interest rates low and good yield hard to find, some Silicon Valley veterans think the paucity of
promising investment options explains the frothy interest in Web companies.
"There are so few places to put money, other than gold and commodities," said Scott McNealy, the former
chief executive of Sun Microsystems Inc. The high valuations of some of the Web companies could drop fast,
he said. "Anything selling more than two times revenues implies Jack Welch is running the joint," he said,
referring to General Electric's former chief.
Evidence that there are too few high-tech IPOs to satisfy demand can be seen in the brisk trading of
private-company shares on the secondary market, said Salesforce.com Inc. Chief Executive Marc Benioff.
"The private markets are hotter than they ever have been," he wrote in an email. Shares of his
Internet-software company, which went public in 2004, are now trading at more than 250 times earnings.
The Nasdaq-100's 25-month rally from its late 2008 trough has driven Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. to
records. Google is approaching a three-year high, and Netflix Inc.'s share price multiplied tenfold. Still, the
index's forward price/earnings ratio sits at about 16.9 times, far short of the 187 times multiple at the peak in
2000.
The Nasdaq's historic run-up in 1998-2000 initially followed a trend line similar to the current rally, until
rocketing higher in the last five months to peak at 313%, more than double the current 119% rally. As Birinyi
Associates points out, the comparison assumes the current rally has hit its peak.
As Wall Street spent the better part of 2010 cleaning up the mess of the financial crisis and bracing for the
Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, a frenzy of start-up investing was taking shape in Silicon Valley. Venture
capitalists, suffering from a decade of poor returns, searched for the next Facebook or Zynga.
Small "angel" investors, seeding companies with $25,000 of their own money, helped drive up the valuations
of young start-ups.
Some of the biggest venture-capital firms also piled in. Venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which
didn't invest in Facebook and Twitter early on, in October launched the $250 million "sFund" to invest in
social-Web companies at a packed event at Facebook's Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters.
All this activity helped bigger Web companies, including Twitter and Groupon, to raise cash at high
valuations.
But it also has meant that some small companies with no revenue, and some with no product, got funding at
lofty valuations.
Those included Quora Inc., a question-and-answer website that in March raised about $14 million at a
valuation of about $87.5 million, people familiar with the matter have said. At the time, the company didn't
have a publicly available product and hadn't said how it will make money. The start-up, founded by former
Facebook executives, has since launched its website and continued generating buzz.
Adam D'Angelo, Quora's founder and CEO, said the company did get a "high valuation" but declined to be
specific, saying he thought the valuation "was reasonable."
The hype around the hot start-ups in recent months has led to "hundreds of Internet companies coming out of
the woodwork" to do an IPO, said one banker, "some of them with no revenue."
The improved liquidity has made it easier for venture capitalists to sell tech-company investments into the
public markets.
Some 46 venture-backed companies went public in 2010, generating $3.4 billion in proceeds, up from the
eight IPOs that raised $903 million in 2009, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

World News: Sarkozy Likely to Seek Lesser Role for Dollar
World News: Sarkozy Likely to Seek Lesser Role for Dollar

PARIS -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy is likely to make a provocative suggestion when he visits
President Barack Obama Monday: Give the dollar a less-prominent role in the world economy.
France has the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 industrialized and emerging nations this year, and Mr.
Sarkozy wants to use the platform to urge a rethinking of the international monetary system, with the aim of
reducing the consequences of excessive currency volatility on global growth.
Key to Mr. Sarkozy's goal is re-examining the role of the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. Last year, Mr.
Sarkozy secured a commitment from China's President Hu Jintao that Beijing would participate in discussions
over currency issues. To get the initially reticent Chinese leader to the table, Mr. Sarkozy sidestepped the
touchy issue of the yuan's valuation.
On Monday, Mr. Sarkozy hopes to snag a similar commitment from Mr. Obama that he will participate in
multilateral currency talks. The argument Mr. Sarkozy will make is that overdependence on the dollar as the
de facto global reserve currency leaves nations exposed to policy decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve over
which they don't have control, said an official close to Mr. Sarkozy.
"To talk about currencies, we need China and we need the U.S. around the table," another senior French
official said.
Economists and analysts say Mr. Sarkozy may be able to make small changes in the international monetary
system by highlighting the issue among G-20 states and by encouraging greater oversight over capital flows
by the International Monetary Fund. But they say it is unlikely he will be able to budge the dollar from its
global throne.
After World War II, when countries started moving away from the gold standard, the dollar gradually became
the reserve currency because the U.S. emerged as the dominant world power. Since then, international trade
has been in dollars, boosting the currency's use. The development of deep, liquid financial markets in the
U.S. and Washington's appetite for cheap debt have helped to cement the currency in its pre-eminent role.
Mr. Sarkozy believes that fostering a more "multipolar" currency system will also help address the increasing
thirst of fast-growing emerging nations for reserve assets, which the dollar alone can't quench.
The French leader said he wouldn't challenge the dollar's role, "which will no matter what remain prominent."
But, he added, "prominent doesn't mean exclusive."
A group of more than a dozen leading international economists led by a former French IMF chief is working
on recommendations to turn the president's thinking into an actual strategy.
The U.S. view is that it is merely supplying what the world demands; Washington sees little space for other
currencies to gain traction. Countries could choose another currency to stock reserves, but at a cost. And
there may not be enough supply of other currencies to meet some countries' needs.
The Fed's recent decision to buy $600 billion of U.S. bonds to boost the U.S. economy triggered ire in many
emerging countries as it accelerated flows of "hot money" into their economies. Those angry reactions to the
move could help Mr. Sarkozy advance the cause of a more multipolar currency system when he meets Mr.
Obama.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Common Sense: Betting Against the Conventional Wisdom in the New Year
WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Common Sense: Betting Against the Conventional Wisdom in the New Year

Welcome to 2011, which already is giving investors a warm and fuzzy feeling, with stock markets in rally
mode and averages hitting post-recession highs. Indeed, the feelings are a little too rosy for this column,
which has often been wary of the conventional wisdom.
This year, the CW is mostly buoyantly optimistic. It may well be right. But if it is, profit opportunities will be
limited. It is when the CW turns out to be wrong that investors can really cash in.
As usual, Common Sense doesn't make a practice of predicting the future, and the CW is all about predicting
it. No one has perfected such a skill, and yet the exercise is often fascinating, especially at the beginning of a
new year. And investing always involves some assumptions about the future, unknowable though it may be.
Last year, Common Sense proved unusually foresighted in this exercise, which emboldens me to venture
another assessment of the conventional wisdom for 2011 and where it might be wrong.
-- Stocks. After two years of double-digit gains, the CW is decidedly bullish, with many pundits again
predicting a 10%-plus rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. There are solid reasons to be bullish,
with consumer spending and sentiment on the rise, industrial production humming and the Federal Reserve
still in an accommodating mode. Rarely have the stars been so aligned in favor of stocks.
Yet the pervasive bullishness makes me nervous, as it did last year at this time. I said then: "I expect at least
one correction of 10% or more this year, which will represent a buying opportunity." For 2011, I expect
another modest correction, and gains in the 8%-to-10% range by year end. This also may be the year when
large-cap stocks take the lead from small- and mid-caps, and when a value orientation begins to overtake
growth.
-- Interest rates. The CW is deafening that the historic post-Lehman Brothers bond rally is over, and that
interest rates are destined to rise in 2011. This makes me very skeptical. Where was this chorus in August
or October, when bonds actually were hitting new highs and interest rates were at historic lows? The
problem with the CW is that bonds have corrected already. Shares of the iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond
exchange-traded fund fell 2.6% over the last two months of the year, which by bond standards is a big move.
I concede that interest rates remain very low, and long term, they pretty much have only one way to go,
which is up. But I'll go out on a limb to say that interest rates will remain low for most of 2011, and that the
big correction in bond prices is already over. I still would be wary of long maturities, and stick to intermediate-
and shorter-term bonds and CDs. But I feel comfortable adding to bond holdings at current prices and yields.
At least investors know they aren't buying at a market peak.
-- Gold and commodities. Gold has been on a tear, hitting new highs during 2010, along with many other
commodities. The attendant publicity has only made it more popular, and it has taken pride of place in
locker-room chatter.
All of this makes me wary. Given its limited industrial uses, gold has traditionally functioned mainly as a safe
haven during times of turbulence and an inflation hedge. I trust the Fed when it says inflation is in check,
and I see no signs of imminent economic chaos despite the hand-wringing over the size of the federal deficit.
Most commodities other than gold are another matter, since they have industrial uses. As the global recovery
gains strength, I would focus on commodity producers rather than the commodities themselves. Energy also
has traditionally performed well at this stage of a recovery, and I've added to those positions. I also have
maintained or expanded my holdings of commodity ETFs.
-- Foreign stocks. After surpassing U.S. stocks for several years, international equities trailed the U.S. last
year, and the CW is that the bloom is off foreign markets, especially China. Chinese equities were volatile in
2010, and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund ended the year with a modest gain of just over 5%.

I concede that the CW is much less pronounced here, but my sense is that foreign markets remain attractive,
especially China. I also expect developed Europe to emerge from the debt crisis, with Germany taking center
stage.

The Fed Should Have a Mandate It Can Likely Fulfill

The Fed Should Have a Mandate It Can Likely Fulfill

Marc Sumerlin's "The Fed's Dual Mandate Is Not the Problem" (op-ed, Dec. 28) shows that by concentrating
on a relative few critical inputs (consumer inflation and unemployment), our central bank has made a
muddle of monetary policy over the last 15 years. By what leap of logic should one assume that a central
bank with only two mandates, which it unsuccessfully met, will be able to better manage an even broader
mandate? How do we define the "skill" referred to at the end of the article? If we define skill as avoiding
current pain at the expense of more pain later, then Alan Greenspan exhibited great skill.
The real issue here is whether a central bank can "control" the natural rhythms of the business cycle. As
ugly as they might be anecdotally, economic troughs fulfill an important purgative function that must take
place in one manner or another. The siren's call of the ability of a central agency to level out the peaks and
valleys of a healthy, expanding economy has led to an unnatural state by which the Federal Reserve is
expected to prop up the economy. The use of props (low interest rates, as one example) inhibit the natural
selection process of the economy, and, like floods on the Mississippi River, the more we try to control the
natural state, the higher the price when the water eventually rises.

The Federal Reserve created the circumstances that led to the mortgage bubble by keeping interest rates
artificially low to blunt the recession that followed the collapse of the tech bubble and 9/11. It continues to
follow zero-interest-rate policies to enable the banks to recover the losses incurred during the collapse.
Contrary to Mr. Sumerlin's analysis, current efforts by Rep. Paul Ryan and other Republicans in Congress to
reform the Fed's mandate would address these mistakes.
The Fed has defined "price stability" in a way that is inherently inflationary. The Fed measures inflation by
reference to the consumer price index, which has led it to ignore inflation in types of prices not included in
the consumer price index (e.g., the price of residential real estate and commodity prices). Second, the
informal inflation target has been set at 2% per annum, which means that the Fed has defined "stable
prices" to mean inflation of nearly 25% each decade. This bias arises from an inordinate fear of mild price
deflation. Historically, however, economic growth has continued during periods of mild deflation, such as
during the later years of the 19th century.
From January 2000 to January 2010, the price of gold went from $284 to $1,117 per ounce, oil went from
less than $23 to $74 per barrel and copper went from $1,670 to $6,980 per ton. Real-estate prices
experienced an unprecedented bubble, although they subsequently collapsed. Most significantly, the value of
the dollar fell against other major currencies, despite investors' growing preference for the relative political
stability of the U.S.
All of these trends distorted the investment environment, undercutting investments in improved productivity
and encouraging speculation based on the expected changes in asset prices in response to a depreciating
dollar. All of these developments were fed by easy money created by the Fed. Yet during this period, by the
Fed's measure, it was satisfying its mandate to maintain stable prices.
The solution to the inflationary bias is to narrow and clarify the Fed's mandate. That mandate should be to
maintain the value of the dollar. In addition, we should limit the Fed's responsibilities to those that enable it to
implement that mandate. The recent financial reform law goes in the opposite direction, giving the Fed a
greater responsibility than it had before for managing the financial sector. We need to move the Fed away
from the impossible task of "managing the economy" and toward the achievable goal of maintaining the value
of the currency.

I have never put a price target on gold, either in a book or any other forum, including at September's London
Bullion Market Association conference in Berlin, where you said I "caused a stir" ("'The World Does Not Need
to End,'" Money & Investing, Oct. 30).
My book "Hard Money" does have a chapter titled "How Gold $10K Is Possible (Taking a Closer Look at
Supply and Demand)," but there's a significant difference between what I believe is possible and what the
article calls a "prediction." Where the price of gold ultimately goes will mostly depend on the fiscal and
monetary decisions made by our leaders. The metal's price rose 2,300% in the 1970s, when central banks
were fighting higher prices. Where gold will go now that leading monetary authorities are doing the opposite
-- that is, actively seeking inflation -- remains to be seen.

Anglers Are in Dire Straits Along Istanbul's Bosphorus --- Mass Fish Migration Celebrated by Aristotle Has Slowed; Why Tuna Steered Right
Anglers Are in Dire Straits Along Istanbul's Bosphorus --- Mass Fish Migration Celebrated by Aristotle
Has Slowed; Why Tuna Steered Right

ISTANBUL -- Every fall, at least for the last couple of thousand years, people here have been going nuts for
fish.
The cause is an annual mass migration, which has been late this year, of finned creatures as they head south
from the cooling waters of the Black Sea toward the warmth of the Aegean. To make the journey, however,
the bluefish, bonito, sea bass, horse mackerel and other species have to crowd from the open sea into the
tiny Bosphorus strait, just 820 yards wide at its narrowest, past an estimated 10,000 waiting rods and nets on
any given day.
Anglers, from women in head scarves to men in wool suits, pack so tightly along the Bosphorus that on some
stretches they're less than a yard apart. Adults shoo kids from the boardwalk because of the risk of getting
snagged. Anglers routinely pull up 10 little fish at a time on their multiple-hook lines.
"We call it the Central Bank," says Mustafa Kokos, head of one of the main commercial fishing co-operatives
on the Bosphorus, referring to the narrow throat of the 20-mile strait.
Back before the Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453, and then renamed it Istanbul, the Byzantines
thought so, too. Their empire stamped coins with the image of a bonito. The Golden Horn, the famed estuary
that leads off the Bosphorus under the city's ancient walls, was likely named "Golden" because of the
quantities of tuna caught during the three-month fall migration, historians say.
Aristotle thought the tuna hugged the right shore because they saw better with their right eye. (They do steer
to the right, but their left eyes are just fine). Homer, in the Iliad, had Agamemnon offer Achilles the riches of
the Bosphorus fishing grounds among other treasures as a bribe to keep the hero fighting at Troy.
Today, a micro-world of commerce revolves around even the small-time anglers who throng along the Galata
bridge, across the Golden Horn. Some man stations in tag teams, around the clock, selling what they catch to
passersby. Carpenters sell the anglers rod holders to strap onto the bridge railings; kebab, tea and corn
vendors feed them; bait sellers bring worms in buckets from a sewage-processing pond outside the city.
But the Central Bank is running out of gold. Mahir Ersin, who fishes for small quantities in his tiny boat says
that while little fish are abundant, the tuna are long gone, as are the swordfish, large bonito and Atlantic
mackerel that used to make the run when he fished here with his father in the 1950s and '60s. "We used to
catch 300-500 kilos of mackerel in a day," recalls the 65-year-old Mr. Ersin. Now, there are none.
Mr. Ersin, a retired journalist for state television, blames overfishing by people such as Mr. Kokos,
commercial fishermen who use sonar fish finders and large circular nets that close like a bag from
underneath. These, says Mr. Ersin, catch babies and mature fish alike. He's leading a web-based campaign
to tighten restrictions on what can be caught in the strait and where the big boats can fish.
"They aren't fishermen" but retired civil servants with a hobby who contribute nothing to the economy, Mr.
Kokos says of people like Mr. Ersin. "They want all these regulations on the Bosphorus and then they sit
around and talk and drink raki." He denied that the commercial boats catch undersize fish.
The dispute digs deep into ancient rivalries. Mr. Kokos calls his opponents "Greeks in Turkey." Unwittingly, he
says, they are helping Greek fishermen to catch the fish once they make it into the Aegean, passing the
Dardanelles strait. "The fish we catch here are migrating. If we don't catch them, then the Greeks and Italians
will," he says.
The European Union is another Trojan Horse, according to Mr. Kokos. If Turkey were to join the bloc, the EU
would demand as a condition of entry that it ban commercial fishing in the Bosphorus altogether and slash

--- Page 200 ---
Page 200 of 219 © 2025 Factiva, Inc. All rights reserved.
the number of fishing businesses from 18,000 to 4,000, he says. Mr. Kokos doesn't want Turkey to join the
EU.
"They're basically saying, we will take you into the common market, and meanwhile we'll give 100 billion
euros ($133 billion) in aid to the Greeks and you can buy your fish from the Greeks," he says. A
spokeswoman for the European Commission said the EU hasn't yet finalized a negotiating position, because
the fisheries element of the talks are blocked because of a dispute over Cyprus.
"There's enough fish in Turkey to feed the world," says Mr. Kokos, who is also fisheries adviser to Prime
Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He says he recently put a proposal to Mr. Erdogan to develop Turkey's
annual fish exports to 5 billion euros in five years from 180 million euros today, in part by keeping the
processing in Turkey. "We should put three hamsi (Black Sea anchovies) in a can, squirt some sauce on it
and sell it to the Americans."
If the big fish aren't crossing the Bosphorus anymore, that's not because of overfishing, but because of the
pollution dumped into the sea by a city that has grown more than 10 times in size since 1955, Mr. Kokos
says. Lights also disturb the fish, as do the churning propellers of the 55,000-plus tankers, container ships
and other large vessels that steam through the Bosphorus every year. And what about those 10,000 rod
anglers, he says: "If each one of them catches just one kilo, that's 10 tons of fish!"
All true, says Saadet Karakulak, professor of fisheries science at Istanbul University. But the biggest threat?
"Overfishing," she said, while acknowledging that, due to lack of funding, no research has been done to prove
it.
The fish most prized here is the lufer, a mature, bluefish that doesn't have the intensely oily flavor that causes
many Americans to throw the lufer's bigger Atlantic cousins back in the water. This year, the lufer haven't
come at all. Mr. Kokos and other fishermen are still waiting, hoping that the migration was just delayed
because the weather was too warm right up to early December. Mr. Ersin believes the lufer migration may be
going the way of the mackerel, because too many less-mature bluefish, known as cenekop and sarikanat
according to their sizes, are being caught. Mr. Kokos is having none of it.
"We heard about a Romanian ship that pulled up a ton of lufer in a single net," he said ruefully. Turkish boats
aren't allowed to fish in Romanian waters.

Dollar Gets A Bump Up From the Fed

Dollar Gets A Bump Up From the Fed

NEW YORK -- The dollar rallied broadly against most other major currencies Tuesday following fresh
indications that the pace of U.S. economic growth is accelerating, underscored by minutes from the Federal
Reserve's last policy meeting.
The U.S. government said factory orders rose unexpectedly in November, and the Federal Reserve
acknowledged the economic rebound seen in data in recent weeks should continue.
A sharp retreat in commodity prices, particularly gold, copper and oil, also drove down commodity-linked
currencies, helping the dollar.
David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn., said investors were unwinding what
he termed "black swan" trades in currencies and gold Tuesday, following the new signs of economic
expansion.
The trades came last fall when investors thought the Fed was "driving into the land of Zimbabwe by printing
money and courting hyperinflation," Mr. Gilmore said. "All of the positions that grew out of the financial crisis
are going to start to come off . . . as the U.S. economy is generating some sense of normalization." A
significant unwinding of such trades could support the dollar.
Late Tuesday in New York, the euro was at $1.3297 from $1.3351 late Monday. The dollar was at 82.04 yen
from 81.74 yen, while the euro was at 109.09 yen from 109.12 yen. The pound was at $1.5585 from $1.5473.
The dollar was at 0.9490 Swiss francs from 0.9344 francs.
A stronger economy could drive Treasury yields higher, making the dollar more attractive, analysts said.
Factory orders jumped by 0.7%, far better than the 0.1% decline analysts had forecast. The report came a
day after news that growth in the broader manufacturing sector accelerated in December.

Gold eked out a record after struggling in negative territory for most of the day, and silver climbed to a more
than 30-year high, as positive economic sentiment shined differently on the two metals.
Investors held off on gold purchases as markets for stocks and other commodities rallied on the first trading
day of 2011. Market participants said the optimism, powered by positive U.S. data, dulled gold's attraction as
a safe-haven investment.
Thinly traded gold for January delivery gained $1.50, or 0.1%, to $1,422.60 a troy ounce on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Actively traded February gold also rose $1.50, to $1,422.90,
also a record. The yellow metal rose for the second consecutive session, and has been up for five of the past
six.
Silver's gains outpaced those of gold. The metal is more widely used in industrial applications like electronics
than is gold. Comex January silver gained 18.60 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at $31.0960 an ounce, its highest
close since March 1980.
Gold lagged behind other commodities because it's "too high to buy at these prices with the stock market
acting well," said George Gero, vice president with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to its highest close since August 2008. U.S. manufacturing data for
December showed improvement in the sector. Separately, U.S. construction spending in November rose for
the third consecutive month.
Investors often turn to gold when they are fretful about the economy, and they buy stocks when they are
willing to take on more risk. They have become more confident after the U.S. economy avoided sliding into a
second recession last year.
Absent any dismal economic data, gold probably will stabilize for a while around the $1,400 mark as
investors become wary of piling money into a precious metal with limited industrial use and zero yield, Mr.
Gero said. However, enough caution will remain that a selloff is unlikely, he said.

Looking back on 2010, one could choose to dwell on the negative. There was no shortage of it.
In January, an earthquake devastated Haiti, killing more than 200,000 in the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere. In April, a mining blast in West Virginia killed more than two dozen in the worst coal-mine
accident in the U.S. in 40 years. Also in April, and continuing through the summer months, an oil rig exploded
and collapsed in the Gulf of Mexico, spilling millions of barrels.
Juxtaposed against the misery, the human spirit shined. In January, the world gathered for the Winter
Olympics, where a luger lost his life just before the start; the Games went on and the host Canadians took the
gold in their most popular sport, hockey. Iraqis and Afghans took part in free, if violence-marred, elections.
Spain won its first World Cup. And in August, a collapsed mine shaft trapped 33 in Chile; less than three
months later a captivated world watched as every miner emerged, safe, from the darkness.
Also making headlines on the domestic and world stages: The U.S. Congress passed overhauls of health
care and financial regulation. Iran continued to press its nuclear ambitions. North Korea clashed with South
Korea. Europe's sovereign-debt crisis resulted in two major rescues and roiled the continent. Several terror
plots fizzled or were foiled. The "flash crash" shook markets.
Here is a summary of news events from the front page of The Wall Street Journal. In most cases, the dates
reflect when the items were published, not the date of the event.
January
4 U.S. consumers in 2009 spent more on movie tickets than for buying movies to watch at home for the first
time since 2002. "Avatar" topped the $1 billion mark in global sales, the fifth film at that level.
5 Novartis said it will pay Nestle $28.1 billion as part of its bid to acquire U.S. eye-care company Alcon, the
biggest takeover in Swiss history.
A suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and contractors and a Jordanian in Afghanistan was a
double agent recruited by the CIA.
Dubai opened the world's tallest skyscraper, at 2,717 feet.
6 Federal prosecutors, expanding a major insider-trading case, alleged for the first time that Galleon Group

7 GM's chief said the auto company would make money in 2010, a bold prediction for a business that exited
bankruptcy in summer 2009.
11 Jay Leno will reclaim his 11:35 p.m. time slot as NBC abandons its prime-time experiment, touching off a
public-relations fiasco with "The Tonight Show" host Conan O'Brien.
13 A 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit Haiti, destroying thousands of buildings in the Caribbean nation's biggest
temblor in two centuries. Damage to the main seaport, airport congestion and a crumpled infrastructure
hampered relief efforts. Early estimates put the death toll at more than 100,000.
19 A Turkish man who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981 was freed from prison with his motives still unclear.
20 Massachusetts went red in a state Senate election upset, foreshadowing the challenges Democrats

pay banks in full on contracts they held with the insurer.
29 Ben Bernanke won Senate confirmation for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman.
February
2 President Obama's $3.8 trillion budget sharply raises taxes on the wealthy. The plan for fiscal 2011 calls for
nearly $1 trillion in tax increases on families with income above $250,000, largely through letting Bush tax
cuts expire.
3 U.S. regulators accused Toyota of dragging its feet on fixing defective gas pedals. The next week, a Toyota
executive said U.S. dealers are repairing 50,000 recalled cars a day and insisted the gas-pedal fix would last
"a lifetime."
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran would accept a nuclear fuel-swap accord overseen by the U.N., but
Western diplomats were skeptical. An opposition leader criticized Iran's regime, saying a dictatorship survives
31 years after the shah's fall.
The Joint Chiefs chairman called for repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" law, saying gays should be allowed to
serve openly in the military. Legal and political battles ensued until year's end.
5 A judge in Haiti charged 10 American missionaries with child abduction and criminal association. Charges
were eventually dropped. Days later, an emaciated man was pulled from the rubble of a market in Haiti,
nearly four weeks after the quake, quite possibly a disaster-survival record.
8 The Saints' 31-17 Super Bowl victory over the Colts caps an improbable turnaround for a team and its city.

government scientist acted alone.
25 An orca whale attacked and killed a trainer in front of a horrified audience at a Sea World show in Orlando,
Fla.
March
1 The death toll from a quake in Chile passed 700. Chile's quake released 500 times as much energy as
Haiti's, but strict building codes helped curb damage.
2 AIG struck a $35.5 billion deal to sell its Asian life-insurance business to Britain's Prudential PLC.
3 BP is pushing through a shake-up of its oil-production business as it seeks to increase profits.

22 The House approved a historic health-care overhaul. Lawmakers gave final passage to the Senate's
legislation on a climactic 219-212 vote. No Republicans voted for the bill; 34 Democrats voted no. President
Obama pushed the measure toward passage with a promise to issue an executive order that no funds
dispensed under the $940 billion bill would pay for abortions, winning over antiabortion Democrats.
A volcano in south Iceland erupted for the first time in 200 years, forcing evacuations.
24 President Obama signed the health-care overhaul into law. The White House ceremonies opened an
intense effort to sell the new law to an often-skeptical public. Over a dozen states filed suit to stop the law,
saying requiring individuals to buy insurance is unconstitutional.
26 Greece won support for a deal that could lead to a bailout, as leaders of the 16-nation euro zone backed
an accord under which they and the International Monetary Fund would come to the rescue should the
nation's debt troubles intensify.
27 Ayad Allawi's alliance won Iraq's national election. The predominantly Sunni alliance edged out Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki's bloc. The upset threatens to end the lock on power that the majority Shiites have
had since 2003, and could test Iraq's fragile institutions. Maneuvering to form a coalition continued throughout
the year.
A South Korean navy ship sank after an explosion near a maritime border with North Korea. Forty-six sailors

Show." His November debut topped his rivals' ratings.

taxes and a bloated federal government.
17 The SEC sued Goldman Sachs, alleging the Wall Street bank and one of its star traders, Fabrice Tourre,

agency.
19 Toyota agreed to pay $16.4 million to settle U.S. charges without admitting that it knowingly hid evidence
of defects from regulators.
22 A fire at an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers and injured 17, casting a pall over the
offshore-drilling boom. Workers were unable to shut off the well's flow before the rig was sank, raising the
possibility that oil could be gushing into Gulf waters.
23 CenturyTel agreed to buy Qwest Communications for $10.6 billion in stock, marking one of the biggest
telecom deals in years.
24 President Obama criticized an Arizona measure to crack down on illegal immigration. Gov. Jan Brewer
signed the measure into law, which makes it a crime for people in the U.S. illegally to be in Arizona and
requires police to arrest those they suspect are in violation. Protests and legal fights shadowed the law all
year.
26 Oil gushed into the Gulf after the previous week's rig disaster. The spill some 70 miles south of the
Mississippi and Alabama coastline has covered 600 square miles and raised fears of a severe environmental
hazard. The oil well, connected to the sunken drilling rig, continues to leak 1,000 barrels a day.
28 Greece's credit crisis spread to Portugal after a pair of ratings downgrades on the two countries spooked

finger at, in part, a hedge trade made by a large mutual fund.
10 President Obama picked Elena Kagan, his solicitor general, as his Supreme Court nominee. She was
confirmed over the summer.

1.1%, to 10510.95, and the euro slumped to a four-year low.
21 BP suggested the oil leak is far bigger than estimated. An oil company spokesman said 5,000 barrels a
day are being diverted to a tanker from a shattered pipe, but more crude continues to spew into the Gulf of
Mexico.
Scientists for the first time created a synthetic cell, controlled by man-made genetic instructions, a move that

diplomats said the situation is one of the gravest threats to Northeast Asian security "in decades."
27 BP began its "top kill" operation to stanch the oil flow. If BP fails, oil could continue to gush into the Gulf of

declared a moratorium on deep-water drilling and accepted the resignation of his top oil regulator.
June
1 An Israeli commando raid on a six-ship flotilla sparked a diplomatic crisis. At least nine pro-Palestinian

acknowledged gay couples as a unit for tax purposes.
7 BP said an oil-well cap collected 10,500 barrels, marking a success after a string of failures in reducing the
oil contaminating the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists estimated that at least 12,000 to 19,000 barrels a day are
gushing into the Gulf. Chief Tony Hayward, in an ad the week prior, promised taxpayers wouldn't foot the
cleanup bill.
10 The Chicago Blackhawks beat the Philadelphia Flyers to win hockey's Stanley Cup, their first since 1961.
11 The SEC signed off on new "circuit breaker" rules designed to tame volatility in individual stocks.

amount of oil flowing from the well to up to 60,000 barrels a day.
17 BP will put $20 billion into a fund for oil-spill victims. The company also said it would cancel dividends for
the first three quarters and pay an additional $100 million into a separate fund to help oil-industry workers
sidelined by the deepwater-drilling moratorium. The payments, which far exceed U.S. legal requirements,
could help deflect the pressure on BP from politicians and the public. The British oil company's chairman
apologized for the spill.
The U.K. government unveiled a shake-up of its financial regulatory system that will consolidate power within
the Bank of England and dissolve the once-vaunted FSA, long the main overseer of the nation's financial

Financial markets of just about every stripe pushed higher in 2010, marking a second year of recovery from
the financial crisis.
As was the case in 2009, investors can thank continued, unprecedented efforts by governments and central
banks around the globe to keep their economies and financial markets afloat for those good returns.
At some point, governments will look to reverse stimulative strategies as their economies and markets can
stand on their own. But for now the betting is that in the U.S., Europe and Japan, at least, that support will
continue for months to come.
The benefits to investors could be seen in 2010. When major stock or bond markets faltered and ostensibly
signaled alarm, policy makers responded aggressively with measures that, at least in the short term, directly
or indirectly drove prices higher across a wide variety of asset classes.
The most direct support came as central banks supported government bond markets in the U.S. and Europe.
That then indirectly lifted corporate bond and stock markets.
U.S. stocks also got a boost in December thanks to an unexpected round of fiscal stimulus for 2011 in the
form of extended and new tax breaks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11% to 11577.51, regaining
levels last seen before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The Standard & Poor's
500-stock index, meanwhile, rose 12.8% to finish at 1257.64. The Dow, which finished less than eight points
shy of its high for 2010, capped the year with a 7.3% gain in the fourth quarter and an 18.5% rise in the
second half. With those gains, the Dow stood 76.8% above its 12-year low close of 6547.05 hit on March 9,
2009, but is still 18% below its all-time high of 14164.53 reached Oct. 9, 2007
Prices of economically sensitive commodities climbed as central banks in many emerging markets held off
raising interest rates despite strong growth and building inflation pressures for fear of damaging the fragile
global recovery. Copper prices, for example, rose 33% and crude-oil prices gained 15% to finish the year
above $91 per barrel. The bet was that as long as China and other raw-material-hungry countries keep
growing at a fast pace, their demand would provide a bid for commodity prices.
In another indirect effect of stimulus efforts, investors worried about long-term damaging effects, especially
the possibility of higher inflation and exploding budget deficits, and bid up gold prices to record highs. Gold
rose $325.90 per troy ounce last year, or 29.8%, to $1421.10.
"The markets and economies aren't being left to their own devices," says Jason DeSena Trennert, chief
investment strategist at Strategas Research Partners. "Policy makers are trying to move heaven and earth."
This isn't quite the way many investors had expected 2010 to play out. As the year got under way, many
investors were pondering how well the markets would stand on their own as the rescue efforts launched in
late 2008 were pared back.
Now, as 2011 begins, the talk of "exit strategies" is concentrated only on the emerging markets, where some
central banks, such as those in China and South Korea, are starting to ramp up tightening efforts.
Among the world's biggest developed economies -- the U.S., Japan and much of Europe -- the consensus is
that support efforts will continue. That should be good news for riskier investments, such as stocks, high-yield
bonds and commodities.
For now, "very few investors are talking about unwinding" stimulus, says Erin Browne, macro strategist at
Citigroup. "Everyone sees it as an eventuality but it's not something that is on the near-term horizon."

The story of 2010 shows how government support continued to prop up financial markets. By the end of the
first quarter, U.S. stocks were on an upswing as solid earnings and improving economic news helped the
Dow in April top the 11000 mark for the first time since September 2008.
Then, in early May, the European debt crisis began to boil over from Greece. Contagion threatened other
euro-zone countries and European banks.
With turmoil spreading in the European bond markets, European governments unveiled a bailout package for
Greece on May 9 aimed at stabilizing financial markets. The staunchly independent European Central Bank,
meanwhile, bought some 40 billion euros of government bonds in the open market during May.
Those efforts gave stocks and other markets a brief boost. By July, however, the Dow was down 7% and
back below 10000 amid fears that the U.S. economy was sliding back into recession led by renewed
weakness in housing and a faltering jobs market. But the Federal Reserve rode to the rescue.
The turning point for the year came in late August, when during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke opened the door for a second round of so-called quantitative easing. Stocks again
began to march higher. In September, the Fed made it official: The central bank planned to pump $600
billion into the markets through purchases of U.S. Treasurys.
Quantitative easing is designed to inflate prices of financial assets. Through purchases of Treasurys, the Fed
is keeping bond yields low and displacing other investors. This forces them to buy riskier investments, such
as stocks or corporate debt, an effect that eventually filters through to the economy.
The rally was given a final boost for the year in mid-December thanks to another round of government
stimulus. While investors had been closely watching negotiations between the White House and Republicans
over an extension of Bush-era tax cuts, they were surprised by news of a 2% reduction in Social Security
payroll taxes for 2011 in addition to two more years of the Bush cuts.
"Eventually, of course, there will be a cost to all these efforts," Strategas's Mr. Trennert says. But for the time
being, investors are being rewarded for not fighting the tide. "Our phrase at the beginning of 2010 was 'bullish
until the bill comes due' and that's still our view."
The stimulus efforts, by raising economists' short-term expectations for U.S. growth even in the face of a very
weak housing market and stubborn long-term unemployment, has investors putting money back to the U.S.
stock market, says Arnab Das, managing director of market research and strategy at Roubini Global
Economics.
For most of 2010, global investors had been pulling money out of U.S. stocks. In the first 11 months of the
year, U.S. stock funds had suffered withdrawals totaling $22 billion. Meanwhile, investors poured a record
$80 billion into emerging-market stock funds and $34 billion into emerging-market bond funds, according to
EPFR, which tracks global bond funds.
But in December, the tide turned sharply for U.S. stocks. In just three weeks, investors pumped more than
$22 billion into U.S. stock funds, EPFR says.
"We think that process of portfolio reallocation has a bit further to run . . . and we're looking for a tactical
outperformance of equities" in 2011, Mr. Das says.
Still, Mr. Das says investors shouldn't ignore the reason for the support efforts. Fiscal and economic structural
problems are "at the heart of why we need so many Band-Aids," he says.
That means risks remain, especially in Europe during the first half of the year, Mr. Das and others say. "Event
risk in the euro zone remains very high," Mr. Das says. "Portugal's turn will come and there's better than even
odds that Spain, too, will be significantly tested in the coming couple of quarters."
There is a different dynamic in the emerging markets. Market support has come not from active intervention
but rather from caution in withdrawing stimulus even as those economies have recovered better than those in
Japan, Europe and the U.S. But that sentiment seems to be changing.
Facing growing inflation issues, "policy makers are looking to withdraw stimulus at a more rapid pace," says
Ramin Toloui, co-head of emerging markets at Pacific Investment Management Co. "The key thing for
emerging-market countries is going to be a measured withdrawal."
The question facing investors is how emerging-market governments and central bankers handle the task of
taking their foot off the gas at the same time as the accelerator is still being pushed in the U.S. Making the
task trickier could be higher commodity prices, which by fueling inflation, could force emerging markets to
tighten more aggressively. That, in turn, could spook other markets.

Citigroup's Ms. Browne thinks the tightening efforts in emerging markets will weigh on stocks in those parts of
the world. "The U.S. market will still be bolstered by the easy liquidity provided by the Fed," she says.
The split between policies in the G-3 economies -- the U.S., Japan and Europe -- and emerging markets is on
the mind of many investors. Pimco's Mr. Toloui says: "Managing this multispeed world is going to be a key
theme for 2011."
