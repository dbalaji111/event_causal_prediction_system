EXCHANGE --- The Wild Bitcoin Bet That's Making One Man Billions --- MicroStrategy shares are up
650% in the past year as big investors buy in","The Wall Street Journal J B1 English Copyright 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Michael Saylor's company doesn't market any hot products or services. What he and MicroStrategy do is sell new shares and debt, at a pace rarely seen in corporate history. Saylor plows all that money into bitcoin, vowing to keep doing it, over and over. MicroStrategy shares are up about 690% in the past year and the 59-year-old executive chairman's approximately 10% stake is worth about $9.7 billion, while he personally owns an additional $1.9 billion or so of bitcoin. Saylor has emerged as the public face of the recent bitcoin craze, with nearly 4 million followers on X. To celebrate bitcoin topping $100,000, Saylor hosted a New Year's Eve party for several hundred members of the crypto community at his waterfront, Miami-area estate, near his luxury yacht. A half-dozen dancers dressed in gold performed. Celebrities mingled with investing luminaries, including Bill Miller, the former Legg Mason fund manager; Peter Briger, chairman of Fortress Investment Group; and Mark Casey, a key portfolio manager at Capital Group. The event was livestreamed on YouTube to tens of thousands of bitcoin fanatics as Saylor, in a black blazer and a bitcoin T-shirt, presided. Enthusiasm for Saylor's company is so rabid it has resulted in a head-scratching situation: MicroStrategy owns about $47 billion of bitcoin, but its shares are worth about $97 billion. It's as if investors are paying $2 for a $1 bill. Just as surprising: Sophisticated investors have been among the biggest buyers, including mutual-fund power Capital Group, which owned about 8% of the company as of Sept. 30, and Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway's $1.5 trillion sovereign fund, which owned nearly 1%. Fans say the premium reflects confidence that Saylor can continue to produce profits betting on bitcoin. Only 21 million coins will be created, a scarcity that boosts its value, they argue. By issuing equity at lofty levels, and selling debt at friendly terms to the company, Saylor can create value for shareholders as he expands MicroStrategy's bitcoin horde, says Richard Byworth, a partner at SYZ Capital, who personally owns MicroStrategy stock. ""The premium is justified and will always be there,"" says Jordi Visser, a Wall Street veteran who worked at Morgan Stanley and recently purchased MicroStrategy shares. ""No company can do what he's done. They own about 2% of bitcoin -- who can own more of it?"" There's serious risk attached to Saylor's strategy. He rode past investment waves until they crested and then crashed, losing billions of dollars of personal wealth, sometimes in a single day. Saylor declined to comment for this article. Saylor, a lifelong bachelor who turns 60 next month, has endured a series of career setbacks and run-ins with financial authorities and others. Last year, he agreed to pay Washington, D.C., $40 million to settle an income tax dispute, after Washington officials alleged that he previously lived in the District, not in Florida or Virginia as he claimed, and should have paid D.C. taxes. The son of a career Air Force officer, Saylor studied aeronautics and science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was part of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps. A few years after graduation, he launched MicroStrategy in 1989 with college friends in Tysons Corner, Va., as a data-mining software company. MicroStrategy soared during the late-1990s dot.com bubble. Saylor's stock was worth about $10 billion, more than enough cash for lavish parties and Caribbean cruises for employees and others. It all collapsed in 2000 when the internet bubble burst. MicroStrategy was forced to restate its revenues and earnings, as regulators scrutinized how the industry booked revenues. In March of that year, the New York Daily News ran a headline: ""Lost $6 Billion in a Day"" with a photo of a then-35-year-old Saylor, clean shaven and in a suit and tie, a dazed look on his face. Later that year, Saylor and two other executives, along with the company, paid $11 million to settle accounting-fraud charges filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the restatements, in which the SEC alleged the company inflated revenue and earnings, allegations Saylor and the others didn't admit to or deny. In July 2002, MicroStrategy shares closed at 45 cents, down from a high of $313 in 2000. Over lunch in Bridgehampton, N.Y., venture-capitalist Rick Rickertsen commiserated with Saylor Rickertsen asked Saylor if he was worried about losing his business. ""I might,"" Saylor said. ""But I'll just start something new."" Saylor restructured MicroStrategy debt and did a 10-for-1 reverse stock split, averting crisis. For years, Saylor searched for the next big thing. For a while, Saylor made personal profits betting on stocks like Google and Apple but was dismissive of cryptocurrencies, tweeting in 2013 that bitcoin's ""days are numbered."" By 2020, MicroStrategy shares had barely moved in years. It was worth just $1.5 billion, though it was profitable and boasted approximately $500 million in cash. Spending time in his Miami estate in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, Saylor tried figuring out what to do with the company's cash. Worried about a potential surge in inflation, as the government spent money to keep the economy afloat, Saylor studied bitcoin anew. He became a believer. Soon, Saylor was pitching his board on the idea of using the cash to buy bitcoin. They agreed, mostly because there didn't seem to be any better alternatives for the company. At the least, the bet would draw some useful attention, they figured. ""The company was going nowhere, it had almost no Wall Street following,"" says Rickertsen, who had become a board member. ""It was bleak."" That year, Saylor spent half the company's money, about $250 million, to buy bitcoin at a price of around $11,000. Saylor put over $100 million of his own money in it, too. Right away, bitcoin's price tumbled to $9,000, costing MicroStrategy about $40 million. 'Most of us on the board said ""Oh my gosh, what have we done, we're all gonna be sued"",' Rickertsen says. ""Mike was worried too."" The panic didn't last long. Bitcoin began climbing, finishing 2020 above $26,000. MicroStrategy borrowed a few billion dollars to purchase even more bitcoin. Then came the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in late 2022. Bitcoin tumbled below $17,000 and MicroStrategy shares fell to about $17. Saylor and the company doubled down. They took advantage of difficulties at its lender, Silvergate Bank, which was also hurting due to crypto, to pay $161 million to buy back their $205 million loan. The stock began to soar as Saylor ramped up his strategy of selling shares and debt to buy bitcoin -- and as bitcoin climbed. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy raised $23.2 billion from stock and bond sales, one of the largest hauls by a company in a single year, according to Mark Palmer, an analyst at the Benchmark Company, an investment bank. Saylor's pitch can be repetitive and simplistic, and he sometimes speaks in a halting manner. But he's always evangelical in his belief in bitcoin. He stresses that it has limited supply, unlike the dollar or even gold. That helps bitcoin do a better job protecting against inflation, Saylor argues. Some mutual funds and others have internal guidelines barring them from buying bitcoin or even bitcoin exchange-traded funds, so MicroStrategy shares are a backdoor way for them to place a wager on the currency. Saylor has proved adept at creating different kinds of equity and debt investments -- rolling out bank loans, convertible bonds, common shares and more -- to keep the cash faucet flowing. ""His genius is he's creating different products for different audiences,"" says Brett Messing, an executive of SkyBridge Capital, which manages funds with substantial exposure to bitcoin and advises a fund that holds MicroStrategy shares. Over the past month or so, Saylor has promoted MicroStrategy and bitcoin on television shows and high-profile podcasts, at industry conferences and elsewhere. ""If you are not buying bitcoin at the top, you are leaving money on the table,"" he recently tweeted. ""He's pretty bombastic in public, but more nuanced in private settings,"" says Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of crypto asset manager Bitwise, who heard Saylor speak at a dinner for 12 investors last summer. His company manages an ETF that owns MicroStrategy. If bitcoin keeps rising, the premium to hold MicroStrategy could continue to exist. If bitcoin tumbles, though, MicroStrategy stock likely will follow. Even if the premium dissipates, while bitcoin holds up, shares likely would be hurt. The company may not face an existential threat, though. MicroStrategy currently has $7.26 billion of unsecured debt, most of which was sold at super-low interest rates. And it holds -- or HODLs, in the parlance of bitcoin fans -- 450,000 bitcoin at an average cost of around $62,000. Bitcoin would have to fall below $16,000 and remain around that level as its debt comes due, for the company's bitcoin to be worth less than its debt. Just over a week ago, Saylor unveiled a brand-new way for MicroStrategy to raise money from investors to fuel its bitcoin purchases. He announced that the company will sell $2 billion of ""perpetual preferred"" shares this quarter. The news sparked Palmer, the analyst, to reiterate his $650 price target for the stock, about 65% higher than current levels."

Bitcoin Rebounds to Near Three-Year Highs
Bitcoin Rebounds to Near Three-Year Highs","The Wall Street Journal J B10 English Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. While stocks, oil and gold prices careened last week, one asset set new highs for the year: bitcoin. The price of the digital currency has surged about 90% in 2020 and traded as high as $13,848 on Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. That is the highest level since January 2018, when bitcoin was coming down from its record of $19,783 set in the previous month. Many investors agree the renewed surge of interest is tied to bitcoin's potential as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin's proponents have touted that prospect for years, mainly because the bitcoin network has a set limit on the number of units that can be created: 21 million. With the coronavirus pandemic wracking economies across the globe, governments and central banks have been forced to spend trillions to prop up their economies while sapping the purchasing power of their currencies. That has revived fear that inflation will ramp up in the coming years, and that fear is winning bitcoin new converts. Some of them include publicly traded companies. Square Inc., which allows users to buy bitcoin on its Cash App, bought $50 million of the digital currency in October to use as a hedging instrument in its corporate treasury. Virginia-based software provider MicroStrategy Inc. made a similar play earlier in the year, buying about $425 million of bitcoin to hold in its corporate treasury. Chief Executive Michael Saylor said in August that the company expected government responses to the pandemic to have a depreciating effect on fiat currencies and saw bitcoin as a viable alternative. Attracting new investors has been a long-sought goal for the crypto industry. Since the 2017 bubble popped, the bitcoin industry has been trying to build out an infrastructure for professional investors, creating everything from exchange-traded funds to options markets and custody services. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve a bitcoin ETF, other services are in place. And investors are beginning to embrace them. ""You had all these rails for institutional capital to come in,"" said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer at BitWise Asset Management. ""Then you had the sharp catalyst: the response to the pandemic and concerns about inflation."" BitWise, which offers crypto-based index funds to financial advisers, hedge funds and family offices, saw its assets under management rise to $100 million as of Wednesday from about $70 million in June, Mr. Hougan said. The largest seller of crypto-based investment products, Grayscale Investments, reported third-quarter inflows of $1 billion into the trust-fund products it sells in the over-the-counter market, raising its total assets under management to $5.9 billion. That growth has accelerated in the current period. The company said Wednesday that its assets under management had grown to $7.6 billion. Options activity is increasing, too. In late 2019, for example, the number of bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Bakkt platform averaged about 1,300 a day. By September, that average had grown to 8,700. Bakkt, a bitcoin options market founded by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has been attracting traditional hedge funds and trading firms and even more recently mainstream brokerage houses, said Bakkt President Adam White. ""They're taking a hard look at crypto and bitcoin,"" he said. Bitcoin's potential use as a payment option got a boost earlier in October when PayPal Inc. said it would allow users to directly buy and sell bitcoin in their digital wallets. In 2021, it plans to expand the service to Venmo and allow the 26 million merchants that use PayPal to accept bitcoin for payment. These developments together have helped push bitcoin's total market value up to about $255 billion from about $130 billion in January. To be sure, those inflows are modest compared with the wider capital markets, where U.S. stocks alone are valued at nearly $52 trillion. But for the small digital-currency market, it is notable. The question for the bitcoin market is the degree to which those flows will continue to increase. For all the feel-good news, there are still substantial question marks. For example, even with PayPal opening bitcoin up to merchants, there may not be much demand for it as a means of payment, especially in the U.S. That is because the Internal Revenue Service has stepped up its effort this year to treat bitcoin not like a currency but like a security, forcing users to pay capital-gains taxes on any transaction that results in a gain. Moreover, bitcoin's claim as a haven asset or inflation hedge has yet to be proven. For one thing, it has been around for only about 11 years, and for most of that time, it has been ignored by the mainstream and viewed a curiosity for risk takers. It has no record as a wide-scale asset class. Also, inflation may simply fail to take off no matter what central banks do, much as it has for the past decade or so. That would undercut bitcoin's use as a hedging tool."

Indexes Continue to Ascend","The Wall Street Journal J B13 English Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Stocks continued to push to previously unseen heights on Thursday, extending their gains after their best day since the presidential election. Investors have been buying stocks and selling bonds, betting the Trump administration will usher in tax cuts, deregulation and fiscal stimulus, which they believe will support growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. The Nasdaq Composite closed at a record for the first time since Nov. 25, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new high every day this week and the S&P 500 notched its second in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.19 points, or 0.3%, to 19614.81, after adding nearly 300 points Wednesday. The S&P 500 rose 4.84 points to 2246.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 23.59 point to 5417.36. ""The markets have been on a sugar high,"" said Kent Engelke, managing director at Capitol Securities Management. ""The momentum and euphoria could carry us to 20000 on the Dow."" Shares of financial companies continued their postelection rally, leading the S&P 500 with a 0.9% advance. Energy stocks in the broad market index gained 0.5% as a group as oil prices rebounded. Some traders said the day's activity was disrupted by outages in Bloomberg LP's terminals, which are used across Wall Street to communicate and trade. Tom Carter, managing director at JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC, said the system dropped out periodically throughout the day, affecting the instant-messaging tool used to communicate with customers and get stock quotes, as well as the order-management function. A Bloomberg spokesman said the company kept its users updated about the issues during the day and that functionality was restored to all users at 2:50 p.m. ET. News Corp's Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, competes with Bloomberg in providing financial news. In Europe, stocks rallied and the euro came under pressure after the European Central Bank extended its stimulus program but said it would slow the pace of purchases. The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.2% to close at its highest level since January after the ECB said it would extend its bond-purchase program by nine months to the end of 2017, but reduce its monthly purchase volume to 60 billion euros from 80 billion euros as of April. Most investors had expected the bank to extend the program for at least six months but keep the pace of its monthly purchases steady. Stocks initially sold off while the euro strengthened as investors concluded the bank was tapering its program of quantitative easing, but markets quickly changed direction during President Mario Draghi's news conference, sending the euro down 1.4% against the dollar to $1.0613. ""The market is seeing this as not a tapering,"" said Jane Foley, a currency strategist at Dutch lender Rabobank. Mr. Draghi ""avoided the negative connotations of tapering by extending the program out to December, three months more than some were anticipating."" Asia/Pacific stocks were mixed early Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 1.1% at midday, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.5%. South Korea's Kospi was down 0.4%, but Australia's S&P ASX 200 was up 0.3%."

Dow Notches Fourth Consecutive Rise
Wednesday's Markets
Dow Notches Fourth Consecutive Rise","The Wall Street Journal J C4 English Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Advances by technology shares led U.S. stocks higher, with the Dow industrials logging their fourth consecutive session of gains. The bulk of the move came after Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Tuesday signaled a slower path for interest-rate increases. Low rates have boosted risky assets such as stocks in recent years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted 17 daily gains so far in March, for the most positive sessions in a month in six years. The blue-chip index has rallied 7.3% so far this month. The size of daily moves has diminished from early this year. The Dow and S&P 500 haven't moved 1% on a closing basis since March 11, and trading volumes have been low. Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of Fort Pitt Capital Group, said he bought stocks earlier this year but hasn't done much recently. ""We're not finding a whole lot of bargains out there,"" he said, adding he believes short-term momentum investors have been driving the market rally. On Wednesday, the Dow added 83.55 points, or 0.5%, to 17716.66. The S&P 500 gained 8.94 points, or 0.4%, to 2063.95 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 22.67 points, or 0.5%, to 4869.29. Shares in Apple rose $1.88, or 1.7%, to $109.56, notching the second-biggest gain in the Dow. The tech sector led gains in the S&P 500, rising 0.7%. The CBOE Volatility Index, which gauges expectations for stock swings over the next 30 days, fell 1.9% to 13.56, hitting its lowest level since August. ""There's this big sense of calm again,"" said Brett Mock, managing director at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC. While Ms. Yellen's dovish message has lifted stocks, it was driven by her view that global economic and financial uncertainty poses risk to the U.S. economy. If the U.S. economy cools and, after years of cutting costs, companies now have less room to do so, earnings could disappoint, said Jack Caffrey, equity portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ""When I reflect on why the Fed is my friend. . .it's because [officials are] scared about something, and maybe I should be, too,"" Mr. Caffrey said. ""That will make for a tricky earnings season,"" he added. Overall earnings at S&P 500 companies are forecast to fall in the first quarter, which would mark the fourth quarter in a row of year-over-year declines, according to FactSet. ""What we're really looking for is an inflection point,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. Mr. Hogan said he expects better-than-forecast results from technology and consumer-discretionary companies, which could be enough to move the market higher. Prices of Treasurys fell, sending the 10-year yield up to 1.830%, from 1.814% Tuesday. The U.S. dollar continued to decline. The euro gained 0.4% against the dollar to $1.1339, while the dollar slipped 0.2% against Japan's yen to 112.44 yen. ""The primary driver for the dollar will be the speed at which Janet Yellen conveys the Fed is likely to raise rates,"" said Brett Wander, chief investment officer of fixed income at Charles Schwab Investment Management. Oil prices pared earlier gains. U.S. crude oil added 0.1% to $38.32 a barrel. In corporate news, shares of MetLife rose 2.27, or 5.3%, to 44.73 as the insurance company won a bid to get rid of its designation as a systemically important financial institution that should be subject to stricter regulations. Lululemon Athletica rose 6.56, or 11%, to 67.80 after the company outlined new long-term sales goals and changes to its management structure. Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 rallied 1.3%. Shares in Asia mostly climbed, and emerging-market currencies rallied as investors welcomed Ms. Yellen's stance on rates. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.8% Wednesday. Early Thursday, it was up 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 1.3% Wednesday as a stronger yen weighed on shares of exporters. Early Thursday, the Nikkei was up 0.3%."

Stocks Rally, but End Week Down
Friday's Markets
Stocks Rally, but End Week Down","The Wall Street Journal J B12 English Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Major stock indexes posted weekly losses, putting a damper on a rally Friday in recently battered commodities and banking shares. The gains snapped a five-session losing streak for the Dow industrials and came on the heels of a particularly rough day for global stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 313.66 points, or 2%, to 15973.84 on Friday, ending the week down 1.4%. The Dow has fallen 8.3% so far this year. Now nearly halfway through the month of February, traders and analysts are increasingly questioning when the stock-market turmoil, which many believed would be short-lived, will end. ""The magnitude and the breadth of the selloff is very surprising,"" said Bart Geer, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Basic Value Fund. ""I've been spending a lot of time recently trying to figure out what it is the market is so negative about that I'm not quite so negative about."" Though sentiment improved Friday, some traders said the buying lacked much conviction. Stock-trading volumes were below this year's average. On Thursday, when markets around the world fell to multiyear lows and investors scrambled to the perceived safety of gold and government bonds, volume was the second highest of the year. The four highest-volume trading days of the year were all down days. Investors were also looking ahead to how Chinese stock markets would reopen on Monday after having been closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. As Chinese markets reopen, U.S. markets will be closed Monday for the Presidents Day holiday. So far this year, the slowdown in China's economy, low oil prices and their implications for the energy sector and the debt market, and whether central-bank stimulus efforts can support economies around the world have haunted stocks. But analysts hoped the relative health of the U.S. economy, as exhibited by better-than-expected quarterly earnings, could help spark a rebound in U.S. stocks. That rebound has yet to materialize. After falling 5.1% in January, the S&P 500 has tumbled another 3.9% so far this month. With more than three-quarters of companies in the S&P 500 done with earnings season, about half have reported sales that beat analyst expectations, according to FactSet. Earnings are on pace to decline 3.7% from a year prior, which is less than the 4.7% decline anticipated as of Dec. 31. Shares of companies that have missed expectations or given downbeat guidance have been punished severely. ""The market was looking for earnings season to be a catalyst, a reason to step in and buy,"" said Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners. ""I don't think it disappointed, but it didn't help."" Instead, stocks around the globe have largely continued to track the rise and fall of the price of oil. The price of oil continued to rise Friday on speculation about production cuts. Late Thursday, oil prices got a lift after the U.A.E. energy minister said OPEC was ready to cooperate on production cuts, though many analysts remain skeptical of an agreement being reached. U.S.-traded crude-oil futures jumped 12% to $29.44 a barrel Friday after hitting a 13-year low the previous day. The gains led to a rally in energy companies in the S&P 500, which rose 2.6% Friday. Financial stocks, hit hard this year on concerns over slowing global growth and the impact of low interest rates on bank earnings, also rose. J.P. Morgan Chase jumped $4.42, or 8.3%, to $57.49 after a regulatory filing Thursday showed James Dimon, the bank's chairman and chief executive, bought 500,000 of his firm's shares. A 5.6% rise in European bank stocks helped the Stoxx Europe 600 add 2.9% Friday, but the broader index still ended the week down 4.1%. ""Financial markets are pricing in a greater chance of recession in the next 12-18 months,"" said Alex Dryden, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. While he expects economic growth to remain modest this year, ""skepticism is settling in over how much more central bankers can do"" if global growth stalls, he added, prompting investors to avoid risk. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell 4.8% as it reopened from a holiday, bringing losses for the week to more than 11%. The dollar was up 0.7% against the yen at 113.253 yen. A close adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Bank of Japan may call an emergency meeting to undertake additional monetary easing if financial markets remain turbulent."

REVIEW --- Mind & Matter -- Fashion Chimps: Grass in Your Ear Is So You, Dear
REVIEW --- Mind & Matter -- Fashion Chimps: Grass in Your Ear Is So You, Dear","The Wall Street Journal J C2 English Copyright 2015 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. We expect words such as ""culture"" and ""technology"" to appear in history textbooks or sociology articles, in newspapers or Silicon Valley prospectuses. But those words also appear regularly in animal-behavior journals -- and, increasingly, in ways that would be familiar to humans who read fashion magazines and follow fads. The ""culture"" concept got jump-started in primatology in the 1940s, with reports of an all-time primate genius, a Japanese macaque monkey named Imo. Her troop lived near a beach frequented by tourists who fed them, and she invented a technique for washing and salting potatoes by dipping them into seawater. Then, not resting on her laurels, Imo had another breakthrough. Tourists would toss the monkeys grains of wheat that would get mixed with sand. Imo figured out that if she threw a handful of the mixture into the water, the sand would sink, and the wheat would float -- and she could then collect the wheat. Where does ""culture"" fit into Imo's biography? Her techniques spread to friends and relatives, continuing in the group for years. By the classic definition of social anthropology, this constituted cultural transmission. Meanwhile, nonhuman primates burst onto the technology scene with Jane Goodall's observation in 1960 that Tanzanian chimps make tools -- sticks modified for fishing tasty termites out of mounds. Subsequent research showed tool use among chimps across Africa: rock hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, clumped-up leaves for sopping up water from tree hollows, sticks sharpened for hunting. Different populations make different tools. New techniques spread across social networks (i.e., among chimps who hang out with each other). Youngsters pick up techniques by watching their mothers (with daughters learning faster than sons, as the latter mess around and don't pay attention). Techniques spread from one group to another when someone emigrates. Strikingly, chimps display something else: conformity. Everyone does something the same way; then someone stumbles on an equally effective alternative. That individual marches to a different drummer for a while before dropping the invention and rejoining the technology herd. So what's new in chimp-culture studies? The transmission of ""arbitrary"" behaviors. If there are two ways of doing something, one, arbitrarily favored by an influential group member, becomes the norm. Or teach a chimp an arbitrary sequence of actions and reward the chimp for them, and the behavior spreads. Reporting recently in the journal Animal Cognition, Edwin van Leeuwen of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands and colleagues saw something irresistibly nutty in a 12-chimp group in Zambia. Back in 2007, a female named Julie got it into her head to start walking around with a long, strawlike blade of grass in her ear. The behavior had no discernible function, and no other chimp had ever been observed to do the ""grass-in-ear-behavior"" (what the authors call GIEB). Could she be trying to ease the irritation of a parasite or infectious disease? The researchers ruled that out, because neighboring chimp groups weren't suffering from ear problems, making it unlikely that Julie was afflicted. Julie just liked having a piece of grass sticking out of her ear. So sue her. The behavior caught on. Chimps soon went about their business with grass stuck in their ears. Julie remained the queen of GIEB-ing. During the five-year study period, the other group members GIEB-ed from one to 36 times, whereas Julie clocked in with an untouchable 168 times. Eventually, two-thirds of Julie's group GIEB-ed. The behavior continued even after her death in 2012 -- the gold standard of cultural transmission. What is this about? Again, as far as our era's finest minds can tell, GIEB-ing is good for nothing. It doesn't get you food or defend you from predators. It's a fad, like the human version. Individuals invent spiky blue hair or embed a permanent ink pattern in their skin or hang hoops from their ears (or from their noses, in another culture). Everyone decides that looks cool. And starts GIEB-ing."

Money Funds Brace for Flood --- BlackRock and Federated Prepare for Investor Influx After FDIC Guarantee Ends
Money Funds Brace for Flood --- BlackRock and Federated Prepare for Investor Influx After FDIC
Guarantee Ends","The Wall Street Journal J C1 English Copyright 2012 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BlackRock Inc. and Federated Investors Inc. might bolt the door to shield their funds from a torrent of money that is expected to flood out of U.S. banks when a federal guarantee lapses on roughly $1.7 trillion in bank deposits. The big money managers worry that cash pouring into the $2.65 trillion money-fund industry will further depress record low yields, hurting investors and making it costlier for managers to operate. If the influx is large enough, BlackRock and Federated have told investors, some money-market funds could be closed to new entrants, said people familiar with the conversations. The private communication is an early sign of the turmoil that could result from the end of a measure installed during the 2008 financial crisis to encourage small businesses to stay with their local banks. The unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. guarantee on no-interest bank accounts is expected to end on Dec. 31 and revert to $250,000 per depositor for each account category. An effort to extend the program died in the U.S. Senate last week. Businesses and municipalities that use the accounts largely for payroll needs are expected to move cash to money-market funds or large banks. As much as $250 billion in deposits could shift, according to FBR Capital Markets. More than $220 billion currently protected by the unlimited coverage is held by banks with less than $50 billion in assets, according to the FDIC. ""It could be a tsunami,"" said Pete Crane, president of Crane Data LLC, a mutual-fund research firm in Westborough, Mass. The big money managers are relaying the plans in response to questions from institutional investors, who say they are concerned about where they should hold their money. The movement of money threatens to increase pressure on big firms that already are struggling to boost profits amid a flood of cash and a shift out of actively-managed mutual funds. As yields fall, so do the fees money managers can charge investors. U.S. money-market fund yields have sunk from an average of 4.97% in 2007 to 0.05% today, according to Crane Data. Pittsburgh-based Federated, the second-largest money-fund company in the U.S., said all its funds remain open. But ""if conditions change, we would certainly do what we could to continue to serve our clients,"" according to a spokeswoman. New York-based BlackRock, the sixth-largest U.S. money-market fund company, said the company has ""no plans to suspend subscriptions into our Treasury funds at this time."" Some fund managers say they already are seeing inflows. Money-market fund assets have increased for five straight weeks, rising about 3% over that span, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. If the surge of cash is big enough, U.S. money-funds could begin to produce negative yields, say industry experts and fund analysts. The last time money funds in the U.S. produced negative yields was during the 2008 financial crisis. Money-market funds that invest in U.S. Treasurys likely would be hit hardest by an influx of new cash because Treasuries are backed by the U.S. government and are expected to be more popular among investors seeking safety. They account for about $399 billion of money-market fund assets, or about 15% of the total. The wave of new cash is also bad news for big U.S. banks that are already swimming in cash. The spread between banks' deposit and lending rates is at its lowest point in three years due to low interest rates and weak demand for loans amid soft economic growth. Big banks have lobbied against an abrupt end to the guarantee, with one industry group saying it may create ""the misperception of instability."" Some small banks already are taking steps to block any outflow of cash, worried that a loss of deposits might reduce their ability to lend. Joseph Perri, chief executive of Islandia, N.Y.-based Gold Coast Bank, said his strategy is to spread client funds into a variety of accounts that carry the $250,000 FDIC guarantee and link them together. An FDIC spokesman said a business can divide its funds among different accounts as long as the accounts are held by separate legal entities. One client that had $8 million covered by the unlimited guarantee recently agreed to split the funds into more than 10 separate accounts, Mr. Perri said. Gold Coast, which has $200 million in deposits, once used the blanket guarantee as a marketing tool and at its height had 15% of deposits under the program. Mr. Perri said he has pushed that number below 5% and doesn't expect to lose ""a nickel"" of the remaining amounts. ""I would put money on that one,"" he said.

Beyond the Bubble -- America's New Economy: Income Gap Shrinks in Slump At the Expense of the Wealthy
Beyond the Bubble -- America's New Economy: Income Gap Shrinks in Slump At the Expense of the
Wealthy","The Wall Street Journal J A1 English Copyright 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The deepest downturn in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression may finally shrink the gap between the very best-off Americans and everyone else. If so, it won't be by lifting up the bottom. It will be by pulling down the top. Over the past 30 years, chief executives, Wall Street bankers and traders, law-firm partners and such amassed ever-greater incomes, while the incomes of factory workers, teachers, office managers and others in the middle grew much more slowly. In 2007, the top 1% of U.S. families accounted for 23.5% of all personal income in the U.S., according to economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics. That was a level not seen since the Roaring Twenties. The top 1%'s share appears to be falling fast. Mr. Saez and other economists expect income going to the top 1% of taxpayers -- currently, those with about $400,000 a year -- will drop to somewhere between 15% and 19% of all income by 2010. That still would leave income distribution more top-heavy in the U.S. than in many other countries. One early indication: Median chief-executive pay at companies in the S&P 500 fell 15% in 2008 (to $7.3 million), according to University of Southern California pay expert Kevin Murphy. ""Based on past experience, it looks like inequality will go down and change the long-term trend of America becoming a less egalitarian society,"" says Ariell Reshef, a University of Virginia economist and another student of the equality issue. This is among several potentially far-reaching changes wrought by the bursting of the housing and credit bubbles and the deep recession that ensued. Finance is likely to claim a smaller share of the nation's talent and make up a smaller part of the economy. The relationship between employers and employees may shift, and some workers will never fully recover from the blows they have suffered. Borrowing will be harder for many, and in any case, reducing debt instead of increasing it will hold new priority, possibly for a long while. In time, the past two years may be seen as a watershed in Americans' behavior and the nation's economic life. At the same time, the income gap, after narrowing during the the 1991 and 2001 recessions, quickly widened again later. That could happen again. New York University economist Edward Wolff says that if efforts in Washington to rein in executive pay, impose new regulations and raise tax rates on capital gains don't succeed, investment and CEO riches could snap back. Still, the recession that began in December 2007 has been of a different animal from those of 1991 and 2001, in that it followed a credit bubble that had sent incomes of finance executives soaring far above those of other engineers and other highly skilled people. The finance and insurance industries, which accounted for 5.9% of gross domestic product in 1990, rose to 8.1% in 2006, according to Moody's Economy.com. That fell to about 7.5% of the economy in 2008, the firm says; it estimates the figure will slip to 7.2% this year. New York University economist Thomas Philippon and Virginia's Mr. Reshef estimate 30% to 50% of the extra pay received by finance-industry workers reflected a bubble in the sector. Less income flowing to the top could have broad effects, from the amount of revenue the government collects to the kinds of cars piling up on dealers' lots.For instance, the top 1% of earners will pay 36% of all federal individual income taxes this year, according to an estimate from the Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank. If their income softens, so will federal revenue, making budgets harder to meet. Less income for the wealthy could lead to a reshaping of the luxury-goods economy, what some call the plutonomy. Half of U.S. consumer spending came from the top 20% of earners in 2000, according to economists Dean Maki and Michael Palumbo. Sales of all luxury goods are expected to decline 15% this year, according to consulting firm Bain &Co. Among big-ticket items, U.S. sales of Bentleys, Maseratis, Maybachs and Lamborghinis have fallen over 50% this year, much worse than the 26% drop for the broader car market, according to Autodata Corp. Another loser: philanthropy. In the brutal second half of last year, the number of charitable gifts of $1 million or more from individuals fell by more than a third from a year earlier, according to the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. Outsized pay will surely live on for some -- in sports, in entertainment and on Wall Street. But there are reasons to believe that on the whole there will be less for people at the very top, not only in this feeble economy but for some time after the financial system heals. For one thing, the Obama administration and the Democrats who control Congress are pressing for regulatory changes and tax increases that target the wealthiest and eyeing restraints on corporate compensation. In addition, the scaling back in the size of the finance sector, at least in the near term, puts a damper on the kind of riches the industry created over the past decade. Mr. Reshef estimates that 21% of the increase in overall income inequality from 1980 to 2005 was attributable to rising compensation in the finance industry. Generally lower leverage and risk-taking on Wall Street serve to shrink the pot of gold from finance. All this would be welcomed by some, particularly on the left. But reduced rewards at the top also ""could diminish incentives for talented people and stifle a certain kind of innovation,"" says Michael Spence, a Stanford economist and Nobel laureate. One member of the top 1%, Charles McDaniel, CEO of a Virginia moving company called Hilldrup Cos., is blunter. ""When high-wage earners make less, at some point they'll say all the policies are stacked against them,"" he says. ""They won't take risks [and] you won't have jobs created or new opportunities."" The leveling of incomes is no abstraction to people like Anthony Carmenate, a son of Cuban immigrants who worked his way from a boyhood job at a Chinese laundry in Hoboken, N.J., to the top ranks of Bank of America's asset-management business. After graduating from Montclair State University in New Jersey, where he paid his way by tending bar, Mr. Carmenate got a job at a call center for Alliance Capital, a predecessor of AllianceBernstein. He sold mutual funds to brokers and rose to become head of U.S. product management. In 2003, Bank of America recruited him to help manage a new unit called Banc of America Capital Management. He bought a five-bedroom colonial home in the Boston suburb of Natick. His wife, Angela, managed the home and raised the couple's three children. The Carmenates didn't consider themselves big spenders, but, with an income of more than $500,000 a year, they began to splurge. She bought Coach handbags and designer shoes. He bought a BMW and Land Rover. When they took their kids to Disneyland or the Jersey shore, they sometimes paid to bring along a baby sitter. This spring, the 42-year-old Mr. Carmenate was laid off, and he has struggled to find a job at anywhere near his former pay. He meets with ex-colleagues, calls headhunters and taps his personal network, but, with banks wiping out layers of management, he says, ""whenever I get a lead, I find that there is a sea of people like me applying for the same one."" He has started to do some consulting work. ""I'm an optimistic guy,"" he says. ""But salaries like mine aren't likely to come back anytime soon. It's simple: Wall Street doesn't need as many people as it used to."" Although nine large banks gave million-dollar bonuses to nearly 5,000 individuals last year, according to a July report by New York's attorney general, the report also showed that the banks' total pay and benefits declined nearly 11% from 2007. The country has seen large shifts in income distribution before. In the 1930s, top earners were battered by the bursting of the financial markets, and New Deal regulation and taxes helped narrow the gap further. The top 1% of U.S. families had 23.9% of pretax income the year before the crash of 1929. By the time World War II ended, their share was less than 13%, where it stayed for some 35 years, professors Saez and Piketty calculate. Starting around 1980, a mix of deregulation, technological change and globalization produced larger markets and fatter payouts at the top. Median CEO pay at large companies rose by a factor of six between 1980 and 2005, after accounting for inflation, say economists Carola Frydman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Raven Saks of the Federal Reserve. By 2007, the top 1%'s share of income had swollen to about as high as it was before the 1929 crash. The gains at the top didn't necessarily come at the expense of others, because the economy expanded greatly after 1980, letting incomes grow across the spectrum. But those at the top end rose more rapidly. In 1980, for instance, the income of the top 5% of households was 2.86 times median incomes; by 2007, it was 3.52 times the median. In other words, the gap widened by 23%, Census data show. At the same time, the amount of mobility up and down the American income ladder has remained largely unchanged over the years, according to most academics who have studied the issue. The rate has been relatively unchanged since 1969, says the Pew Charitable Trust. Among the factors putting pressure on incomes at the top now is a shift in the political winds in Washington. Tax changes pushed by President George W. Bush after the 2001 recession reduced income taxes disproportionately on wealthier Americans. President Barack Obama, by contrast, campaigned on a pledge to use the tax code to reduce inequality, and he hopes to limit the Wall Street risk-taking that fed huge paydays. The White House and Congress are taking aim at executive compensation, with a federal pay czar scrutinizing compensation at some companies in which the government invested. White House economist Austan Goolsbee says that ""this isn't Robin Hood. The president's policy is not about trying to prevent incomes from growing in the top 1%,"" The administration argues that higher tax rates on wealthier Americans would pay for needed investments. Pressure on pay at the top extends well beyond finance. At law firms, billings ballooned earlier this decade, and law-firm salaries accounted for 1.5% of all U.S. salaries in 2007, twice the share in 1980, according to Economy.com. The firm expects this to fall to 1% in 2018. Darren Tucker, a 36-year-old antitrust attorney in Washington, was rising at O'Melveny &Myers, earning about $400,000 last year as a ""counsel."" That was one rung below partner, where annual payouts average about $1.5 million. But earlier this year, his boss told him he shouldn't expect to make partner anytime soon, in part because business was slowing. Having already seen a round of layoffs, he leapt at a chance for a job at the Federal Trade Commission paying $153,000. ""What was keeping me at O'Melveny &Myers was the big salary to come,"" Mr. Tucker says. His former boss at the firm, Richard Parker, says he helped Mr. Tucker land the FTC job and praises his legal skills. Mr. Tucker and his wife have been spending $100,000 a year for treatment for their two children, who he says were diagnosed as autistic. With the job shift, says his wife, Anne, they have moved one child, who has greatly improved, into public school. For the first time in years, she is looking for a job, as a substitute teacher. The wealth boom of the past decade was also fueled by entrepreneurs and family companies -- beneficiaries of easy credit, economic growth and rising asset values. Many of them, too, are taking a hit. A world away from Wall Street, Mr. McDaniel, whose family owns the Hilldrup moving-and-storage firm in Stafford, Va., is used to luxuries. ""I like to be well treated,"" he says. He has hopscotched to high-priced vacations in five-star hotels: skiing in Colorado in winter, snorkeling in the Caribbean in the spring and fly-fishing in Wyoming or Montana in the summer. The burly Mr. McDaniel, a 45-year-old former University of Virginia star linebacker, is also a regular, with his teenage son, at Super Bowls, and sometimes charters planes for East Coast trips. He drives an Audi A8 L, a model that starts at about $75,000. When the economy is humming, ""psychologically you're on a high, and the business supports that high,"" he says. This year, Mr. McDaniel worries that the family company's revenue of about $100 million may drop by 20%. To cut costs, he is turning salaried drivers and packers into independent contractors, paid by the move. For those still on salary, he is freezing pay and suspending 401(k) contributions. This summer he rented a house on a North Carolina beach rather than jetting to Jackson Hole, Wyo. Among those sharing in the income setback at the top will be the charities to which Mr. McDaniel commonly gives. ""If my business is off 20%, my salary may be off 20%, so my charitable giving should be off 20% too,"" he says.

In Rising Crude Prices, Some See '08 Replay --- Climb Has Been Faster Than Last Year's
In Rising Crude Prices, Some See '08 Replay --- Climb Has Been Faster Than Last Year's","The Wall Street Journal J C3 English Copyright 2009 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The rapid rise in the price of crude-oil futures, which touched $70 on Friday, is sparking fears of a repeat of last year's energy rollercoaster. Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday hit $70.32 before closing down 37 cents at $68.44. Prices remain well below what they were a year ago, when oil was selling for more than $125 a barrel, but the climb in recent months has been even steeper than last year's. Prices have more than doubled since closing at $33.98 on Feb. 12, the recent low. They're up more than 50% since the start of 2009, compared to a 33% rise during the same period last year. Experts see two main forces behind the recent rise in prices that echo last year's climb. First, investors are putting money into oil as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar; last year, investors were guarding against a weakening stock market. Second, investors are betting that early signs of economic recovery suggest a looming shortage of oil. A year ago, oil bulls argued rising demand in China and India would lead demand to outstrip supply. ""What we are seeing here is a replay . . . It's the same phenomenon,"" said Ann-Louise Hittle, head of oil market analysis for the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. To be sure, there are significant differences between this year and last. A year ago, the global economy was cooling but not yet in recession, and demand for oil was still rising worldwide. OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was producing at close to its maximum rate. Now demand is falling. The International Energy Agency predicts global oil consumption will be 3% lower in 2009 than in 2008. And OPEC members are producing millions of barrels a day below their capacity. Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil stockpiles are 19% higher than a year ago, according to the Energy Information Administration. That's enough to meet 25 days of U.S. demand, up from 20 days a year ago. Some analysts warn that with prices being driven by investor sentiment, not market fundamentals, the leap in prices could give way to an equally sharp drop -- just like last year. ""There may be enough momentum to carry us up to just $72.50, but then I think the correction is going to be just that dramatic,"" said Guy Gleichmann, president of United Strategic Investors Group, a commodities brokerage in Hollywood, Fla. The rise in energy costs could slow down recovery from the recession, some economists suggest. Retail gasoline prices have risen 23% since the end of April, to $2.52 per gallon on average. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for the Oil Price Information Service, warned that could lead more consumers to pull back spending. But there are signs that oil producers, many of which slashed spending when prices were falling, are gaining confidence in the price recovery. The Russian oil company TNK-BP this week said it would increase its capital spending by $400 million to $3.7 billion, Reuters reported. Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest Western oil company, has in recent days announced investments in large, long-term projects, which analysts said will be viewed as a green-light for others to pick up the pace of their spending. That increase could boost supplies, easing pressure on prices as demand eventually recovers. Oil producers have warned for months that reduced drilling could lead to supply shortages when the recession ends.  Russell Gold contributed to this article."

Large Stock Focus: AIG's 5.1% Decline Weighs on the Dow --- Lehman and Others Show Weakness;
Wyeth Up on Test","The Wall Street Journal J C6 English Copyright 2008 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. On a day when Goldman Sachs Group caused a stock-market rally with its robust profit -- and then a market selloff when its analysts warned of more financial-sector trouble -- there were pockets of strength that withstood the selling. In the health-care arena, shares of drug maker Wyeth rose $2.08, or 4.8%, to $45.16; and American depositary shares of Irish partner Elan rose 2.89, or 11%, to 30 after the Alzheimer's-disease treatment they're developing looked to be effective in some trial patients. Anheuser-Busch rose 67 cents, or 1.1%, to 61.20 after The Wall Street Journal reported the chief executive of Belgian brewer InBev met with U.S. lawmakers to assuage concerns about its proposed takeover of the Budweiser maker. American depositary shares of Barclays also swam against the tide, rising 60 cents, or 2.3%, to 26.57 after the British bank said it is considering raising capital. Barclays had faced criticism that its core Tier 1 ratio, or capital held against risky assets, was low compared with its peers. Such gains were the exception, however. Stocks rose at the open, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by as many as 53 points as Goldman lifted the financial sector. Gradually, the market turned on the banks and brokers, and shares of Goldman closed down 2.65, or 1.5%, at 179.44. Meanwhile, Goldman stock researchers helped stamp out the rally in financials, warning that banks would face accelerating losses in the third quarter. Similarly, Friedman Billings Ramsey warned that consumer-credit delinquencies would likely spill into business loans, hurting the stocks of many regional banks. Business loans are the grease that help turn the wheels of economic growth, and an uptick in missed payments often coincides with a recession. Indeed, default rates on commercial mortgages rose in May, according to Fitch Ratings. American International Group stock fell 1.73, or 5.1%, to 32.28, the Dow's leading percentage decliner. After a bounce Monday, broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings slid 2.06, or 7.6%, to 25.14; Zions Bancorp (Nasdaq) shed 3.79, or 10%, to 33.37; and Fifth Third Bancorp (Nasdaq) fell 83 cents, or 6.1%, to 12.73. The only consistently strong sectors in recent weeks are those that directly benefit from rising prices for food and fuel. Tuesday, the only three gainers on the Dow were Exxon Mobil, up 63 cents at 88.62; Chevron, up 1% at 100.37; and DuPont, up two cents at 47.15. Among fertilizer makers, American depositary shares Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile surged by 4.42, or 9.4%, to 51.58, more than double its price three months ago. Mosaic tacked on 5% to 161.08, more than quadruple its price 12 months ago. Range Resources rose 2.05, or 3.2%, to 67. Oil-and-natural gas prices hovered near highs, and the driller struck a deal with a pipeline operator to support its production operations on the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian Mountains. Not all commodity producers joined in the rally. Shares of Canadian uranium producer Cameco fell 78 cents, or 2%, to 37.46 after the value of its stake in Centerra Gold plummeted on a report that the Kyrgyz Republic stripped the gold miner of its mining licenses. Among retailers feeling the pinch of inflation on their costs and their customers, Best Buy fell 2.42, or 5.3%, to 43.46. The consumer-electronics store logged a decline in fiscal-first-quarter profit. Revenue rose as big-ticket items counteracted a slowdown in customer traffic. In the technology sector, shares of Adobe Systems (Nasdaq) fell 1.45, or 3.4%, to 41.40 after the maker of Photoshop graphic-design and Acrobat publishing software said overseas sales offset weakness in the North American economy.

Rice Prices Are Steaming, With Many Implications --- Developing World Is Vulnerable To Expected
Food-Cost Inflation; Hedge Funds Get Into the Act","The Wall Street Journal J B1 English Copyright 2007 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. The global commodities boom that has lifted prices of everything from gasoline to gold is now elevating rice -- a staple food for half of the world -- to its highest level in nearly 20 years. Rice's surge has complex consequences for the global economy. Used in everything from sushi to burritos to Rice Krispies, the ubiquitous grain is suffering poor harvests and tight supplies in some of the biggest rice-exporting and rice-consuming nations, just as demand grows in places like India and the Philippines. The higher price is a boon for some farmers and investors. But at the same time, it is expected to contribute to a protracted bout of food-price inflation for the foreseeable future, which could widen the rift between the world's haves and have-nots. ""At the end of the day, the fight will be between the industrialized world and the developing world,"" says Michael Lewis, managing director at Deutsche Bank. A particular humanitarian concern is that the world's poorest consumers, many dependent on rice, often have little or no voice. ""When they suffer food shortages, they starve in silence,"" says Joachim von Braun, director general at the International Food Policy Research Institute. Soaring prices are drawing myriad investors into the market. On the Chicago Board of Trade, the number of bets outstanding on rice futures contracts recently reached a high -- a basic sign that more traders see a chance to make money on rising prices. Nontraditional players, such as hedge funds, are now trading in rice, according to Fred Seamon, associate director of commodity research at the CBOT, and new exchange-traded investment products aimed at individual investors are also being rolled out. Two months ago, Jim Rogers, founder of the Rogers International Commodities Index, launched the Rogers Agricultural Exchange Traded Note. While prices for other commodities like oil have been flirting with records in recent months, in inflation-adjusted terms, agriculture commodities still have room to rise before reaching that point. For example, the price of wheat will have to increase by 106% before it reaches its record high in real terms, according to Mr. Lewis at Deutsche Bank. As rice prices rise, food aid for developing countries is becoming scarcer. And the international price for broken rice, an affordable grade favored in many African countries, has increased 40% since last year, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. On the CBOT Friday, rice futures contracts settled at $13.1250 per 100 pounds, down 5.5 cents. That is up from $9.87 a year ago and just shy of the previous record price of $13.40, set in January 1988 when rice was traded at the Mid-America Exchange. While prices like these aren't at record levels in inflation-adjusted terms, they nevertheless threaten to exacerbate poverty in large areas of the world. One risk is that, in some cases, rising prices lead to food shortages and social unrest. Indeed, in November a riot that broke out in Senegal was in part attributed to higher prices for rice, a staple there. Protesters, throwing rocks and burning tires, were met with police firing tear gas. The story of rice echoes that of nearly all commodities, whether petroleum, copper or wheat. Prices for many commodities are surging thanks to booming demand from emerging economies like China. It is having broad ripple effects: Steel prices make it costlier to construct buildings; the rising cost of oil helps to drive up the cost of world shipping rates. Rising oil prices also make it costlier to grow and ship rice and other grains -- which, in turn, drives up food prices. Agricultural commodities, of course, tend to have a more direct human impact than, say, oil or steel. Grains have been trading at or near historic highs partly because of a combination of growing demand for biofuels -- such as ethanol made from grain -- as well as a rising global population, which means more mouths to feed in the developing world. In addition, the weaker dollar has helped to boost global rice prices, as most rice is traded in dollars. In Thailand, the world's largest rice exporter, the price of long-grain rice has increased nearly 20% since last year, according to Nathan Childs, senior economist at the Department of Agriculture. All these factors have depleted global grain stocks to levels not seen in decades. Wheat stocks are at their lowest level in 60 years. Rice stocks are at 24-year lows. Complicating matters: Historically, rice has been a thinly traded market. Only about 7% of global rice production is traded on the world market, according to Mr. Childs. This means that, in the event of a supply shock, rice importers have to scour the globe for available supplies, driving up the price even further. For comparison, about 16% of other grains, like wheat and corn, are traded globally. Increased demand and tightening supplies are likely to persist. The Agriculture Department estimates that food prices will increase about 4.5% this year over last, compared with a 2.4% annual increase last year. In the developing world, food prices have increased about 9% over last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Higher food costs tend to hit people in poor countries harder than those in developed countries as households in developing countries spend a larger percentage of their income on food. In the U.S., food makes up about 18% of the overall consumer-price-index basket, compared with as much as 40% in some emerging economies, according to a report by Deutsche Bank. For countries that rely on donations or aid to feed the hungry, higher prices can mean less food. At the United Nations World Food Program, rice is the third-most-frequently purchased commodity, and it supplies more than 70% of caloric intake in poor countries like Cambodia. ""If prices go up we'll be getting less of that particular commodity,"" says WFP spokeswoman Jennifer Parmelee. She says the price of procuring food has increased 50% over the past five years. Since 2000, global rice consumption has increased 7.5%, while production increased about 5.4%. As supplies run short, the risk for the world market is that big rice exporters start keeping the food for themselves rather than selling it on the market, further driving up prices. In July, Vietnam -- the world's second-largest rice exporter after Thailand -- said it would restrict rice exports in order to meet domestic needs first. India, another large exporter, announced similar export restrictions in October. The U.S. accounts for only about 1.5% to 2% of global rice production, but it is the fourth-largest exporter, behind Thailand, Vietnam and India. This year, U.S. rice acreage was 3% smaller than last year because of strong prices for competing crops, like corn and soybeans. However the crop is estimated to be 2% bigger because of higher yields. U.S. exports are expected to be nearly 20% higher than last year."

U.K. Stocks Touch 5-Year High --- Commodity-Price Lift, Sign U.S. Rate Rises May End Add Fuel

U.K. Stocks Touch 5-Year High --- Commodity-Price Lift, Sign U.S. Rate Rises May End Add Fuel","The Wall Street Journal J C14 English Copyright 2006 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. London -- THE UNITED KINGDOM'S benchmark share index touched five-year highs, helped by a rise in commodity prices and a suggestion that U.S. interest-rate increases are nearing an end, which fueled gains across the world's stock markets. With Britain's economy expected to continue growing this year, and mergers-and-acquisitions activity still strong after a months-long boom, strategists say London's market could have more room to run in the longer term. But some contend that London's stock market may first see a pullback as investors realize companies will be hard-pressed to maintain profit-margin increases they have posted for the past year and thus that earnings expectations may be exaggerated. Teun Draaisma, head of European equity strategy at Morgan Stanley, says the outlook for U.K. stocks, as with other European stock markets, is positive over the next two years. But he cautions that in the next three to six months he expects a pullback in the U.K. and across Europe as earnings estimates are lowered. Still, the FTSE 100 at one point yesterday hit 6100, a level not seen since February 2001, at the tail end of the technology-stock boom that later led to several years of poor performance in the U.K. and other European stock markets. The index closed at 6089.80, up 45.70 points, or 0.8%. The gains followed Tuesday's rally for U.S. stocks, the best gains of the year there, after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting suggested the Fed's two-year run of steady rate increases may be ending. Many investors had worried that further increases in U.S. interest rates would risk hurting global consumption and investment. So the suggestion that rates didn't have further, if any more, to rise, also lifted other European stock markets. Many Asian markets also rose; South Korea's main index set a new peak during intraday trading, and Hong Kong and Taiwan reached five-year highs as well. Japan's 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 117.26 points, or 0.7%, to 17350.12. The prospect of a standstill in U.S. interest-rate increases hurt the dollar, which at one point fell to $1.2385 against the euro, lowest since September. In late New York trading, the euro stood at $1.2390. In the U.K., the stock market has rebounded in the past three years, as a range of conditions has favored investors. ""U.K. corporate profitability is very high; the cost of their financing isn't; share-price valuations are still low; and the interest-rate environment, where the Bank of England has recently cut rates, is supportive,"" said Robert Parkes, a U.K. strategist at HSBC. Continued strength in the oil price, which reached multidecade highs above $71 a barrel (later in New York above $72), and fresh records in the price of some metals also buoyed the U.K. market. Around a fourth of the market's capitalization is in mining and oil companies. Miner BHP Billiton, for instance, rose 0.8% to GBP 11.90 ($21.18), while oil major BP rose 1% to 704 pence. Another factor in the FTSE's rise has been the increase of merger-and-acquisition activity in the U.K., where around $98 billion has been spent buying up British companies so far this year, up 40% from this point last year, according to data provider Dealogic. ""M&A activity has been about U.K. companies' being taken over, so you get the premium companies to pay to bid for others coming through,"" Mr. Parkes said. ""And the deals are cash deals, meaning that money is going back into investors' pockets and into the market again."" Some strategists fear forecasts for European per-share earnings growth of around 10% for 2006 might prove too optimistic. Some, though, believe U.K. stocks just no longer look so cheap.  Other Market Activity Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.92 points, or 0.76%, to 256.13. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 2.51 points, or 1.14%, to 222.47. In TOKYO, the Nikkei's rally was led by technology, financial and consumer-sector stocks. Computer maker Fujitsu rose 1.25% after Tuesday's announcement it expects its 2005 operating profit to rise 13%. Sony rose 2.1% on reports the consumer-electronics company plans to invest more in thin-screen liquid-crystal display television sets through its joint venture with Samsung Electronics. In SYDNEY, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 35.30 points, or 0.7%, to a record 5283.90. Zinc and lead producer Zinifex rose 11%, and copper, zinc and gold miner Oxiana rose 7.7%. In PARIS, the CAC-40 rose 62.17 points, or 1.2%, to 5158.14, reflecting general euphoria on other European exchanges. Lafarge led gainers, up 3.8% amid generally firm construction stocks. LVMH rose 3% before first-quarter sales figures. EADS and Thales were the only two fallers in the index.

GM, Caterpillar, Google Decline; GE Bucks Trend With a 2% Gain","The Wall Street Journal J C4 English Copyright 2006 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Stocks continued their seesaw pattern, with General Motors and Caterpillar dragging on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while component General Electric advanced. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 65 points, or 0.58%, to 11150.70, with drops marked by 23 of 30 components. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose just 3.04, or 0.13%, to 2340.82, enough to put the index at a five-year high. The Standard &Poor's 500 Index lost 2.64, or 0.2%, to 1300.25. The market has been moving in a saw-toothed pattern since Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve increased its fed funds rate by another quarter-point, to 4.75%. Stocks were down big that day, rose on Wednesday, and the Dow industrial average, for one, struggled yesterday. ""People don't have conviction one way or another,"" said Scott Weber, head trader at Paulson Investment Co. ""They are looking at interest rates, and as they go higher, what their impact is on stocks. At the same time, the Fed has been increasing the money supply, which is a positive."" General Motors had by far the biggest percentage drop among the industrials, losing $1.09, or 4.9%, to $21.06. A crucial deadline for labor talks at leading supplier Delphi loomed, and investors awaited word from the auto maker on the status of its plans to sell its lending arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp. Caterpillar continued to decline, with a loss of 1.27, or 1.7%, to 72.40. Shares fell 1.6% on Wednesday after UBS downgraded the heavy-machinery maker to neutral from buy. General Electric was the industrial average's biggest percentage gainer, rising 72 cents, or 2.1%, to 34.65. Morgan Stanley raised its earnings estimates, growth rate and target price for the industrial and financial conglomerate, saying shares could climb to between $60 and $65 within three years. Bank of New York gained 1.50, or 4.4%, to 35.92 and Dow industrial J.P. Morgan Chase shed 15 cents to 41.53. J.P.

The casual-dining chain's fiscal third-quarter earnings easily beat expectations, and the company also noted that its restaurant-level profit margins exceeded predictions. Nasdaq Stock Market lost 1.74, or 4.2%, to 40.11. The securities trading concern abruptly dropped its landmark $4.2 billion bid for the London Stock Exchange PLC without giving reasons. A.G. Edwards gained 2.20, or 4.8%, to 48.33. The financial-services provider reported a 58% increase in fourth-quarter earnings, partly because of increased investments in fee-based accounts, which provide a less volatile and more predictable revenue stream. CarMax fell 2.24, or 6.3%, to 33.50. The used-car retailer sees fiscal 2007 earnings, including stock-based compensation, at $1.25 to $1.47 a share, compared with analyst views of $1.52. The company also said fiscal 2007 growth in total sales is expected to be significantly lower than the 19% increase achieved in fiscal 2006. Metals stocks rose as prices for the commodities hit record levels or came close. Copper producer Phelps Dodge gained 4.46, or 5.8%, to 81.48; Newmont Mining rose 1.44, or 2.8%, to 52.93; and Freeport-McMoRan Copper &Gold advanced 1.45, or 2.4%, to 61.15. Whirlpool dropped 4.49, or 4.7%, to 91.46, and Maytag fell 42 cents, or 1.9%, to 21.39, after a big run on Wednesday. A date has been set for Whirlpool to close its purchase of the fellow appliance maker, after the close of trading today, according to Standard &Poor's. Dean Foods, which will replace Maytag in the S&P 500, gained 94 cents, or 2.4%, to 39.69. Patterson-UTI Energy (Nasdaq) rose 2.19, or 7.2%, to 32.54. The provider of contract-oil and gas-drilling services reported fourth-quarter profit that nearly quadrupled and said day rates would likely continue to increase, easing concerns that demand for onshore drilling services would falter as natural-gas prices receded from recent highs."

Bush Vows Aid to Storm-Battered Gulf Coast --- Oil Reserves to Be Released, Air-Pollution Rules
Eased In Effort to Lift Gas Supply","The Wall Street Journal J A3 English Copyright 2005 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. With fuel prices rising amid fears of 1970s-style shortages emerging in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Bush administration scrambled to ease the pain by releasing oil from government stockpiles and suspending air-pollution rules to gin up extra gasoline supplies. Gasoline prices are now likely to stay above $3 a gallon the rest of the year, according to the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. Yesterday, there were scattered reports of price increases -- from Ohio to Maine -- that pushed pump costs above that level. More disturbing were signs of fuel-supply disruptions, as pipeline and refinery outages continued for a third day. Petroleum Traders Corp., one of the country's largest independent gasoline wholesalers, said BP PLC, one of the nation's biggest gasoline suppliers, had said it was cutting off delivery. ""I've been doing this for 26 years and I have yet to see a national disruption of this scope,"" said Michael Himes, president of closely held Petroleum Traders, of Fort Wayne, Ind. He added that he has gasoline-station owners calling him saying they will pay ""any price, I just need the fuel."" BP spokesman Scott Dean said the company decided to focus on meeting its contractual obligations and stop crude to wholesalers who buy gasoline on spot markets. Even though no company refineries were impacted, he said, ""we are facing disruptions to our crude supply and we are suffering disruption in pipeline availability."" Red Cavaney, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents most segments of the oil industry, warned that the impact on oil and natural-gas supplies ""will be significant and protracted."" Making a rare pitch for people to drive sparingly, Mr. Cavaney said: ""Right now will be a good time for people to ramp up their energy conservation."" Hoping to avert a wide-scale energy crisis, the Bush administration announced an emergency, temporary easing of some pollution-control standards on gasoline and diesel fuel. ""It is clear the consequences of the hurricane have become more widespread,"" said Stephen Johnson, head of the Environmental Protection Agency as he announced the moves. Under existing federal air pollution rules, many cities must have special ""reformulated"" gasoline to curb smog, which requires refiners to make and store a variety of different fuel blends. Yesterday's waiver allows existing supplies to be marketed over broader areas. The Department of Energy said it had given one major oil company, which it didn't name, permission to borrow crude oil from the 700 million barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve, though the department said later the company rescinded its request. The Energy Department said it was working out the details of similar swaps with several other companies. But some of the government's emergency stockpile must travel through the same immobilized pipelines that normally supply oil from the Gulf, so it was not clear how quickly the government aid might ease the supply shortfall. ""You can't put products in the pipeline if you don't have any pressure,"" Mr. Cavaney said. He also noted that refineries must undergo a period of testing before they can begin to produce gasoline. European nations hold large volumes of gasoline in their strategic reserves. Claude Mandil, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, said his 26 member nations were prepared to funnel gasoline to the U.S. immediately, if needed. But John Felmy, the petroleum institute's chief economist, said that it will take two weeks or more to get additional gasoline from Europe. The big unknown is whether recovery will take days or weeks. Storm flooding and widespread electricity outages in the Gulf area kept key pipelines shut down that would supply both crude oil to the region's refineries and ship refined products, including gasoline and heating oil north to the Midwest and the East Coast. The key problem will be the lag before new supplies reach major gasoline markets. Transportation Department teams scrambled yesterday to hook up dozens of emergency generators to oil pipelines in an effort to get the Gulf's oil circulation system running again. Meanwhile, according to the API, 25% of the nation's domestic oil production -- most of it coming from platforms in the Gulf -- remained shut down. Some officials were concerned that Port Fourchon, La., which is the major ingress point for pipelines, and which supplies crews and supplies to offshore oil rigs, could be closed for as long as a month because the storm drove silt into its shipping lanes. Widespread flooding and power outages conspired to keep eight refineries shut down yesterday morning and a ninth, Exxon Mobil Corp.'s gigantic Baton Rouge facility, on a reduced run. Crews were unable to reach at least four major refineries because of flooding. Still, one of the two pipelines that carry refined products like gasoline from the area to the South and East Coast said it was restarting. Mr. Felmy said that until supplies began moving again, gasoline, propane, heating oil and other products could be in short supply, especially in the Midwest and upper East Coast, areas which are normally fed with both crude oil and refined products from the Gulf. In West Virginia, two major transportation authorities that supply gas to public buses, ambulances and police cars escaped a fuel crunch only by getting emergency deliveries yesterday. The Transit Authority in Huntington, W.Va., was about to run out of gas today, which would have shut down its public transportation system for disabled residents, said Paul Davis, an assistant general manager of the authority. Paul Fiore, executive vice president of Service Station Dealers of America and Allied Trades, which represents state service stations around the country, says he hasn't heard of any supply shortages or outages among gasoline retailers. He said, however, that he has heard prices at the pump rose by as much 50 cents to more than $3 per gallon overnight. Asked about price gouging at a terrorism press conference, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said that government officials had a meeting yesterday about the situation due to Katrina. ""Long term, things we are concerned about are issues like price gouging, fraudulent charities,"" he said. ""Short term, we're focused on ensuring we have efficient law and order.""

Honeywell, 3M and Altria Climb, While Washington Mutual Falls","The Wall Street Journal J C4 English Copyright 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. NEW YORK -- As the market rose ahead of today's anticipated interest-rate increase, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was assisted by smokestack stocks including 3M and Honeywell International. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 56.34 points, or 0.54%, to 10413.43, the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 15.11 points, or 0.75%, to 2034.93 and the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index advanced 2.85 points, or 0.25%, to 1136.20. ""The market has already discounted the Fed's interest-rate decision 23 times,"" said Alfred Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &Farnham, ""so people are moving on to the next thing, second-quarter earnings, and I think they're going to be good."" The industrial average's best performers included 3M, rising $1.11, or 1.3%, to $89.80, and Honeywell, gaining 31 cents, or almost 1%, to 36.65. Lehman Brothers raised its price targets for the diversified manufacturers, saying there may be more steam to the industrial recovery than originally thought. Dow industrial component Altria Group rose 62 cents, or 1.3%, to 50.22. The parent of Philip Morris USA continued to benefit from word on Monday that a federal court judge cleared the way for cigarette makers to request an immediate appeal of a ruling in the government's racketeering case.

There were developments for other banking companies, with Washington Mutual dropping 2.84, or 6.9%, to 38.47, after lowering 2004 earnings guidance, saying higher interest rates have cut its mortgage production outlook. Some other home lenders appeared to be affected; with Countrywide Financial falling 2.18, or 3.1%, to 69.32 and Astoria Financial dropping 76 cents, or 2.1%, to 36.38.

The provider of technical and construction services lowered its fiscal third-quarter and full-year earnings guidance, citing order delays and cancellations by a major customer. American Greetings rose 90 cents, or 4.1%, to 22.80. The greeting-card company said earnings for its fiscal first quarter exceeded internal estimates, despite weaker sales, and forecast ""about break-even"" per-share earnings for the second quarter, a period in which it has historically reported a loss because of the seasonal nature of its business. Siebel Systems dropped 42 cents, or 3.8%, to 10.59 on Nasdaq. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged the software provider and two top executives with an alleged violation of Regulation FD, which prohibits companies or their officers from selectively disclosing material nonpublic information.

Fulcrum Global Partners initiated coverage with a ""buy"" rating, saying it feels satellite broadcasting is becoming a mainstream consumer service and demand will keep growing. Halliburton fell 61 cents, or 2%, to 29.88. The energy, construction and engineering services provider said it will record two second-quarter charges totaling $815 million, reflecting new problems with an offshore construction project in Brazil and additional costs to finance its asbestos-litigation fund.

Gibraltar gained 6.6% on Nasdaq. Gold stocks dropped as the price of the precious metal fell. Glamis Gold lost 77 cents, or 4.4%, to 16.84, Barrick Gold fell 32 cents, or 1.6%, to 19.59 and Gold Fields lost 31 cents, or 2.9%, to 10.35.

Gold's Post-Nasdaq Revival --- Mining Stocks Have Been Surging Since Early 2001 Amid Worries
About Economy and Terrorism","The Wall Street Journal J C1 English Copyright 2004 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. AFTER ENDURING THREE years of misery as his tech-stock holdings declined, Rich Garrett last year shifted his retirement money to a place he considered safer: gold-company stocks. Sure, gold makes him nervous, too, he says -- especially since most of the mining stocks he owns have been down this year. But overall, Mr. Garrett's gold stocks have soared since he bought them last year. Today, he is one of a number of ordinary Americans who have rediscovered an investment that once was considered hopelessly outmoded -- gold. ""You always get a little twinge when you see your investments go down, but after what I experienced in the Nasdaq, this is nothing compared to that roller-coaster ride,"" says Mr. Garrett, a 59-year-old salesman from a St. Louis suburb. ""I feel a lot more comfortable with gold than with the Nasdaq, or the Dow, for that matter."" Since the start of 2001, stocks of the world's gold and silver mining companies, as measured by the Dow Jones World Precious Metals Index, have more than doubled in value, while the Nasdaq Composite Index has fallen 21% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 5%. Last week, amid continuing fears of a resurgence in terrorism, gold rose 2% to $422.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, nearing the 15-year high of $426.40 reached during January. The question is whether gold is a lasting refuge again, or a flash in the pan. One way to see how attitudes toward gold have evolved is to look at a group of recently minted gold investors, the clients of St. Louis money manager Wistar Holt. Mr. Holt became interested in gold and gold-mining stocks in 2001 as a means of protection against the falling market and has been proselytizing for gold ever since. Because of continuing doubts about the economy and the prospects for the broader market, he has kept clients mainly in gold stocks, which are easier to buy than the actual commodity. He also has them invest in bearish mutual funds that bet on market declines, which did badly during the recent stock boom but have done better in recent weeks. ""The price of gold has gone up because there is a lot of mistrust in the stock market, in all aspects of the stock market. It is hard for average investors, if there is such a thing, to know who to trust anymore,"" says Philip Salembier, a 55-year-old architect and former tech-stock investor who switched to gold about three years ago on the advice of Mr. Holt. Some investment advisers are horrified at the thought of putting clients into gold stocks. While gold is moving gradually back onto some investors' radar screens, it remains the controversial province of a hardy group of aficionados. In the past, the doubters point out, although gold has sometimes been viewed as a refuge for nervous investors and a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness, it has been anything but safe. The gold market, in fact, in the late 1970s went through its own bubble, which popped noisily in 1980 after the metal traded briefly above $800 an ounce. The ensuing bear market in gold lasted, with ups and downs, almost 20 years, and gold fell as low as $254 in 1999. But the metal, and the stocks of the companies that mine it, took off again around the start of 2001. It was then, as investors realized that the tech boom was over and began looking for other options, that they rediscovered gold. Even some fans of gold still see it as a temporary investment. ""This is just a short-term way to get through the bear market. It isn't like we are going to be here our whole lives,"" says Bob Boly, a civil engineer with the Metropolitan St. Louis Sewer District and a Holt client. But, propelled partly by the weakness of the dollar and partly by worries about terrorism and an uncertain economy, gold stocks have remained strong even as the broader stock market has recovered during the past 18 months. The Dow industrials on Friday slipped 5.85 points to 10212.97. For the week, the industrial average gained 26.37 points, or 0.26%, while the gold index rose 1.78%. Some of the new gold bugs acknowledge that the stocks have risen so much that they wonder how much further they can go. And they say friends and colleagues sometimes laugh at them. ""I have discussed gold with my brothers,"" says Mr. Salembier, the architect. ""They just laughed at me. They said, `That is entirely too risky.'"" Some people ""really looked at me strangely"" when he talked about gold, says Mr. Boly, the engineer, but he adds that one co-worker recently decided to switch some of her own investments to gold. Looking at his account statement, he says, ""It kind of scares me. I mean, is this going to go down as things did after the late '90s? But I am confident that if it does, [Mr. Holt] will get us out.""These investors are aware that the wider stock market has recovered strongly since the fall of 2002, and some have begun wondering whether it is time to broaden their investments. But Mr. Holt is telling them that the economic outlook remains uncertain and that gold has more room to run. ""I have even called him and talked to him about when it is going to be time to get out, because the Dow did go up a lot last year. But I agree that there still are a lot of uncertainties out there. Even though this is volatile, there is still a lot less uncertainty being in gold stocks,"" says Mr. Boly, 46. ""Sometimes I think we should sell everything. But what are you going to get into?"" Richard Durley, a research scientist at a large pharmaceutical company in St. Louis, is hedging his bets in more ways than one. He has put about half his investments in gold stocks and the other half in small biotechnology companies that he thinks will do well even if the rest of the market has trouble. The main reason he has turned to gold is that he thinks the growing U.S. trade deficit ultimately will become hard to fund. ""People have been buying U.S. securities, particularly the Japanese and the Chinese, but they will be buying gold in the next few years,"" says Mr. Durley, 61. ""I think the U.S. dollar will experience a substantial decline over the next few years."" People sometimes tell him he is crazy. ""Yes, I could be nuts, but this is the way I am seeing it for the next two years,"" he says. If the stock market were to retreat, however, and stocks started looking cheaper, he might shift a bit more money to the biotech stocks, he says. Many of the new gold investors are sticking with it largely because it has worked. ""I don't know that I understand the technical aspects fully, but it makes sense to go into gold when the economy isn't that good,"" says Judy Sewing, a 54-year-old consultant to health-care and fitness companies who lives in Clayton, a St. Louis suburb. She began using Mr. Holt to manage her money shortly before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. After those attacks, she says, her friends were impressed at how well her portfolio held up. ""I was recommending my broker to other people,"" she says. Some of the gold investors are people who were burned by the tech bubble and are going to the other extreme. ""I was heavily invested in the Nasdaq, primarily through my retirement plan, which is a self-directed employee pension plan,"" says Mr. Garrett, the salesman. He did so well with Nasdaq tech companies during the bubble that for a long time he was sure the stocks would bounce back. ""I held and held, through 2002."" He gave up after losing half his savings, he says, and happened to see an ad in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for Mr. Holt's firm."

The usual media suspects are treating Alan Greenspan's Congressional testimony this week as one more opportunity to rumble over fiscal policy -- never mind that taxes and spending aren't the Fed Chairman's job. We see his remarks, instead, as the first salvo in a debate over who'll take the heat when interest rates start to rise later this year or next. The folks who want to repeal President Bush's tax cuts are typically broadcasting the Chairman's familiar distaste for budget deficits. Yawn. Most of them ignored his other comment that ""I've always argued the problem is on the expenditure side,"" which is to say the inability of the political class to slow the growth of spending. ""I am in favor, as I've indicated in the past, for continuing the tax cuts that are in dispute at this particular stage,"" Mr. Greenspan added. The Fed chief knows that the incentives provided by those tax cuts have helped put the economy in its current rationally exuberant mood. He said that the pace of growth may reach 5% this year, that individual and business spending are rising, that productivity is surging, and that while net new job creation has been slow it too will start to increase soon. ""Last year appears to have marked a transition from an extended period of subpar economic performance to one of more vigorous expansion,"" he declared. No wonder liberals are pouncing politically on ""deficits"" and the ""outsourcing"" of service jobs overseas; everything else is going too well. They're confounded by prosperity they never expected, so they are left predicting disaster just around the next corner. We thought the real news in Mr. Greenspan's testimony was on monetary policy. He blew away any thought that the Fed is worried about the dollar or inflation. The obvious message is that the Greenspan Fed isn't going to raise interest rates before the election if the Chairman can possibly avoid it. Mr. Greenspan seems to think, and for now the markets agree, that he can keep monetary policy as wide open as it now is through November without rekindling inflation. We wish him luck, but those of us who look at commodity markets for real price signals have watched the dollar fall and gold and commodities rise. Economist Brian Wesbury, of Griffin, Kubik in Chicago, adds that a 4% year-over-year increase in the producer price index ""is a clear sign of inflationary pressures."" Sooner or later these will build and force the Fed to tighten. And here's where Mr. Greenspan's ""deficit"" worry is relevant. The Fed chief is more or less saying that if he and his fellow governors do have to raise interest rates smartly next year, don't blame them. The deficit will have made them do it. Mr. Greenspan doesn't have a reputation as a savvy Beltway player for nothing. We aren't about to let the Chairman off so easily. If inflation rises faster than expected, and interest rates rise along with it, the responsibility will rest squarely with the Fed. Congress and the President set fiscal policy, and their cuts in dividend and income-tax rates have helped lift the economy after a rough patch. Given even modest spending restraint, the deficit will fall as growth spins off more revenue. The Fed's job, on the other hand, is to keep a firm hand on the monetary tiller to maintain a stable price level. If that means raising interest rates in an election year, so be it."

Brazil's `Housewives' Pinch Nation's Pennies
Brazil's `Housewives' Pinch Nation's Pennies","The Wall Street Journal J B1 English Copyright 2003 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Belo Horizonte, Brazil -- LYNDA REZECK and Emilia de Moura fan out through a supermarket here in Brazil's third-largest city to hunt down rice, sugar, laundry detergent and 90 other items. But these housewives are pushing pencils -- not grocery carts -- in this particular price-shopping reconnaissance mission, which is key to their ongoing battle against Brazil's economic scourge. After years in check, inflation is climbing again, and a group known as the Housewives' and Consumers Movement is mobilizing to contain the damage to Brazilian consumers. Led by a matron in her sixties with silver hair, manicured nails, gold bangles and the gift of gab, this battalion of 5,000 homemakers is pressuring supermarkets to cap prices. It is also setting an example in a country where consumer activism is in its infancy and women are still struggling for a public voice. ""Despite my surname,"" says Lucia Pacifico, the movement's founder whose last name means ""peaceful"" in Portuguese, ""I am a real fighter."" Inflation is a logical rallying point for public outcry. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Brazilians saw their buying power eroded by hyperinflation that reached 4,000% a year. The government finally slayed the price demon in 1994. But now annual inflation has returned to double digits, thanks to the sharp depreciation of the country's currency last year ahead of October presidential elections. New left-leaning President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has vowed to tackle inflation, as price rises of food and household goods have been the steepest, reviving the fiscal trauma for poor and middle-class Brazilians. ""We have to put the brakes on this spiral of prices,"" says Mrs. Pacifico. The Housewives' November 2002 survey found that since May of that year, the prices of cooking oil had jumped 78%, flour 70% and sugar 69%, higher than official inflation indexes recorded. So, Mrs. Pacifico demanded a meeting with the state supermarket association, whose members include big retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Carrefour SA of France. The goal: a legally binding agreement to stabilize prices for a month, hoping that by then inflationary pressures will have begun receding. The last time the housewives sought such an accord was in 1999, when Brazil carried out a massive devaluation and then let the currency float freely. Mrs. Pacifico, a retired elementary-school teacher, started the Housewives' movement with a dozen friends in 1983. Whereas many American women activists find the term housewife pejorative, in Brazil ""dona de casa"" connotes domestic authority, which extends over the household budget. The movement has spread to 14 states from its origin of Minas Gerais, Brazil's second most populous state. Funded by the $8 annual membership dues, the movement publishes monthly price surveys, offers free lectures on household budgets, legal counseling, a caller hotline and an occasional newsletter, depending on finances. Its headquarters in Belo Horizonte comprises three rooms and a small auditorium in a skyscraper -- space owned and donated by the municipality. The movement gained prominence in 1988, as Brazil was drafting a constitution for the return of democracy after two decades of military rule. Mrs. Pacifico played a key role in lobbying Brazil's Congress to pass a consumer-protection code and a law entitling housewives to receive government retirement benefits. The tough consumer regulations allow for binding accords between businesses and civic groups to control the price, quality and quantity of goods -- the basis for Mrs. Pacifico's showdown with the supermarkets. At the meeting in early December, Mrs. Pacifico is flanked by fellow housewives, a statistician (one of two men who work for the movement), an independent market researcher and a lawyer. Cordially, the two sides haggle over price targets for 36 items, and sometimes their proposals differ by just two U.S. cents, as in the case for a kilogram of sugar. But the housewives don't relent. When Adilson Rodrigues, the head of the supermarket group, requests a ""force majeure"" clause that would allow retailers to breach the price controls, Mrs. Pacifico and her peers won't hear of it. ""That clause would defeat the purpose of controlling prices for 30 days,"" declares Monica Castro, a member of the movement's board. A stone-faced Mr. Rodrigues agrees to take the message to his members. ""I have a lot of respect for the housewives,"" he says after the meeting. ""They speak for millions of anonymous consumers."" As the negotiators spill out of the movement's conference room, they are greeted by a horde of eager reporters. With inflation making headlines, Mrs. Pacifico is a media star, and she or other Housewives' movement members appear daily on a local radio talk show. The housewives and supermarkets make progress over the ensuing days. But they hit a snag on chicken, because a key input, cornmeal for chicken feed, is priced in dollars, and Brazil's exchange rate continues to fluctuate unpredictably. Once the sides hammered out their differences, hundreds of supermarkets in Belo Horizonte put up signs advising customers that they are taking part in the price-control campaign with the Housewives' Movement. ""Even those chains which aren't inclined to join the effort, end up joining,"" says Mr. Rodrigues. ""It's bad for your image to oppose."" Wal-Mart plays down the influence of the Housewives' movement, noting that the company already operates under wafer-thin profit margins. ""Any initiative to offer consumers better prices is in line with our corporate culture,"" says Aprigio Rello Jr., director of corporate affairs for Wal-Mart in Brazil. Still, Wal-Mart also participates in the price-control campaign. Few Brazilian consumer activists have attained the high profile of Mrs. Pacifico, who was elected to the state legislature in 2002 after serving on Belo Horizonte's local council. To acknowledge growing support among men, she changed her organization's name from just the Housewives' Movement to the Housewives' and Consumers Movement. She often leads demonstrations in the city's main park to protest price rises, most recently a government-ordered increase in cooking fuel. Mrs. Pacifico doesn't lack gumption: A few years ago she broke through the security cordon at a cattle exhibition to hand Brazil's then president a list of consumer gripes. Last year, she dashed to Brasilia, the federal capital, to crash a meeting between the government and civic groups to discuss electricity rationing. She sweet-talked her way past security, but a government official barred her from the meeting, saying she hadn't been invited. Determined that the Housewives' movement be heard, Mrs. Pacifico proclaimed to waiting reporters, ""You can't decide about energy-rationing in households without talking to housewives."" In the end, Mrs. Pacifico got a face-to-face meeting with then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. She kept up the pressure after energy rationing started in June 2001. Mrs. Pacifico sounded the alarm over the fact that several companies had discreetly reduced package quantities -- say, of crackers, tuna and toilet paper -- without reducing the price. The companies blamed the energy shortage, which forced some factories to install expensive generators. Almost all manufacturers returned to the original quantities; those that didn't were fined for violating consumer-protection laws. The movement's latest victory was with the bakery association. (""The price of bread rolls is out of sight,"" Mrs. Pacifico says of Brazil's breakfast staple.) After three rounds of negotiations with the association, the Housewives' Movement brokered an agreement last month representing 5,000 bakeries in Minas Gerais state -- a first -- to keep the price of bread rolls at the current price of about six cents each for 60 days. ""If we don't make a stink,"" Mrs. Pacifico says, ""consumers will be abused."""

Year-End Review of Markets &Finance 2002 --- Bad News Was Good News for Commodities, Which
Posted Gains --- Mideast, Argentine Unrest, Crop Failures, Stock Jitters All Fueled Increases in Value","The Wall Street Journal J R8 English Copyright 2003 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. COMMODITY PRICES changed course in 2002, rising in response to improvements in overall domestic productivity, as well as poor growing conditions for certain crops and political uncertainty, especially the standoff with Iraq that continues to buoy energy prices going into the New Year. It was a gradual, yearlong rally, although the markets' heaviest gains came in the second half. The Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index jumped 24%, or 21.243 points, to 110.276. The rise followed a 21% decline in 2001, when raw materials fell as the stock market plummeted and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks plunged the economy into uncertainty. In 2002, investors' lingering jitters made gold one of the commodity markets' stars, as the metal reclaimed its traditional role as a financial haven during precarious times. Gold futures skyrocketed 25%, or $69.20, to $348.20 a troy ounce in trading at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the energy markets, the rally came despite weak demand in the U.S. and other industrialized markets, fueled by the situation in Iraq and fresh turmoil in Venezuela. Even with political uncertainty in two major oil-producing nations, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was so doubtful about the world economy's demand for more crude that late in the year it declined to increase output. Going into the New Year, many forecasters say the sheer dynamics of supply and demand should drive energy prices down -- although a war or other nonfinancial event could disrupt that scenario. In other markets, analysts expect modest price increases, as both the stock market and the economy gradually recover, and consumers begin to spend more on the finished goods for which commodities are a basic part. ""There's plenty of room for commodities to keep going up, assuming the economy continues to do well, because prices are nowhere near the point where they've begun to signal inflation and threaten the broader economy,"" says Adam de Chiara, Senior Vice President and head of Commodity Index Group at AIG International Inc. ""It's not like commodity prices are the equivalent of the Nasdaq at 5000, like a bubble."" The Dow Jones-AIG index is still about 20% off its all-time high, set in 1997, he notes. Here is a rundown of major markets in 2002: Energy Talk of whether America will take military action to disarm Iraq dominated the crude-oil trade all year, and prices for refined fuels and natural-gas prices tracked the crude market's gyrations closely. Crude-oil prices gradually rose above $30 a barrel through the early fall, eased when the U.S. acceded to a new round of United Nations weapons inspections, then rallied again through the end of the year as the White House accused Iraq of failing to disclose details of its chemical and nuclear programs. Political unrest in Venezuela, where labor unions and other dissidents are pushing for the ouster of President Hugo Chavez, also boosted energy prices late in the year. For the year, crude-oil contracts jumped 57%, or $11.36, to $31.20. Gasoline contracts rose 52%, or 29.72 cents, to 86.97 cents a gallon. And heating-oil contracts leapt 58%, or 31.79 cents, to 86.86 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange. An early winter blast of cold weather in the Northeast also boosted demand for heating oil and natural gas. The latter continued its long-term price rise as gas is increasingly used to power environmentally friendly electric power plants. Natural-gas prices rose 86%, or $2.219, to $4.789 per million British thermal units at Nymex. Few observers expect support for prices above $5 much longer, however, considering that the country now has more than 2.6 trillion cubic feet of gas in reserve, according to the American Gas Association. By contrast, reserves had almost gone to zero when gas prices were at their peak of more than $9 per million BTUs during the California energy crisis a few years ago. ""Back then, we were calculating the date when we would run out of the stuff,"" says energy analyst John Kilduff, of the brokerage Fimat USA Inc., in New York. ""Now, we're trying to figure out what to do with the stuff."" Mr. Kilduff is even less bullish on crude, which he believes may fall to $15 a barrel, if the uncertainty in Iraq and Venezuela is resolved. He also says he expects global crude demand to remain weak in 2003, at best remaining unchanged from the current 77 million barrels a day. ""The market lately has kind of been a tale of two worlds,"" Mr. Kilduff says, with a political premium in the energy markets but weak fundamentals. Metals The industrial and precious-metals sectors were a mixed bag, as only platinum posted a rally that could keep pace with gold's run-up. Platinum contracts jumped 23%, or $109.40, to $594.40 at Nymex on continued low mine production of the geologically scarce metal. Palladium, which is an important component of emissions-reducing car parts, continued its steady decline from record highs in 2001. Its contracts fell 47%, or $210 a troy ounce, to $238 at Nymex. Although it often occurs in nature with platinum, its price had soared much higher in 2001. The silver market continued to be burdened by a glut of above-ground reserves, rose only 22.4 cents, or 4.9%, to $4.812 a troy ounce, at Comex. Overall, the sector's performance was something of a reversal from the metals markets of recent years, when consumers were spending more money on cars, cameras and film (which uses silver as a major component). Prices of those metals led the way, and gold was shunned, as investors flocked to paper assets such as stocks or the U.S. dollar. Now, analysts say gold has the brightest outlook of any precious metal going into 2003. Frank Holmes, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Global Investors, which manages several gold-oriented mutual funds, says the metal could top $375 an ounce before mining companies can increase output. ""For about five years now, while the gold price was lagging, no one's really been starting any new [mining] projects,"" Mr. Holmes says, adding that meanwhile, demand for gold has increased. Most base metals markets were plagued with a glut of reserves to weigh down prices. Aluminum edged up only 0.7%, or $9.50, to $1,344 a metric ton, and zinc fell 2.3%, or $18, to $749 a metric ton at the London Metal Exchange. Copper was a notable exception to the base-metals trend, as combined reserves of the metal at LME and Comex warehouses fell 14% to 1.15 million metric tons. Several major mining firms also announced production cutbacks, or programs to withhold selling metal they have already mined, pushing copper prices to 70.25 cents a pound, up 6.6%, or 4.35 cents, for the year at Comex. John E. Gross, an independent metals consultant and publisher of the Copper Journal newsletter, says he expects a similar trend this year, possibly pushing the metal's price as high as 80 cents. Right now, all the base metals are being driven by speculative trading, which is good for some of them,"" he says. Agriculture A modestly improving economy boosted beef prices late in the year, while the pork market trailed until late August, when prices started to rally on forecasts that reduced births would result in tight supplies by year end. Those fears seemed to be confirmed by a recent government report showing that storage of frozen pork bellies is near a 37-year low. For the year, pork-belly contracts rose 5.9%, or 4.775 cents, to 86.20 cents a pound. But live-hog contracts slipped 9.6%, or 5.45 cents, to 51.60 cents a pound. Live-cattle contracts rose 13%, or 8.925 cents, to 79.625 cents a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In the grain markets, poor growing conditions in parts of the U.S., Australia and Canada generally pushed prices higher, although most crops were well off their highs by the end of the year. At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean contracts leapt 34%, or $1.4275, to $5.65 a bushel. Wheat contracts rose 13%, or 36 cents, to $3.25 a bushel. Corn futures rose 13%, or 26.75 cents, to $2.3575 a bushel. Going into 2003, however, most analysts say that only soybeans have a modestly bullish outlook. Otherwise, a return to more normal levels of production should damp grain prices, as will a bearish export outlook that includes rising output from low-cost producers in Eastern Europe and other regions, says Vic Lespinasse, of brokerage firm A.G. Edwards & Sons. He said soybeans will likely buck the trend toward lower prices because few countries besides the U.S. have focused their agricultural efforts on producing the crop in large quantities. While consumers outside the U.S. don't rely as heavily on soybeans as an alternative to meat as a source of protein, consumption is increasing and some countries are using beans as animal feed . In particular, he says several large purchases that have been attributed to anonymous buyers in recent U.S. Department of Agriculture reports were likely sent to China, for use as livestock feed. ""They've just developed a voracious appetite for soybeans,"" says Mr. Lespinasse. ""Historically, they've always produced more of their own corn and wheat. Now, they have an incentive to switch some of that production over to beans, but that will take a while."" In other agricultural markets, lumber prices fell 11%, or $27.40, to $217.70 a board foot at CME amid bloated inventory. Cotton recovered from near record lows going into 2002 to finish at 51.60 cents a pound, up 45%, or 16.01 cents, at the New York Cotton Exchange division of the New York Board of Trade. Tropical Commodities Aside from gold, one of the commodity markets' strongest sectors last year was tropical commodities, also known as softs. Cocoa led the way, surging 54%, or $711, to $2,021 a metric ton amid political unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa-producing nation. A failed coup Sept. 19 has led to a war that has increasingly split the former French colony along ethnic lines. Also, the cocoa market saw its third consecutive production deficit, with a shortfall of about 133,000 metric tons, says Judith Ganes-Chase, an independent analyst and consultant. She estimated that trend, and an increase in prices, would continue this year. ""To make up for the shortfall, we'd probably need another 200,000 tons of production,"" she said. ""I just don't see where that's going to come from."" In the orange-juice market, a smaller Florida citrus crop offset a slight increase in Brazilian output. Frozen orange-juice contracts rose 2.3%, or 2.1 cents, to 93.25 cents a pound. Ms. Chase expects a similar uptick this year, as the two major producers flip-flop their roles and Florida is expected to raise production while Brazil's crop slips. By contrast, she estimates sugar traders and producers should be happy if they do as well this year as in 2002, when they pretty much broke even. Sugar futures edged up 3.0%, or 0.22 cents, to 7.61 cents a pound at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, despite the industry's ninth consecutive production surplus. The string of overruns has left a massive inventory of about 63 million metric tons, compared with total production of an estimated 140 million metric tons in 2002. The surplus was more than four million metric tons last year. ""I can't think of a market that has a more bearish fundamental picture,"" Ms. Chase says. ""You would think this market would be at three cents, not skimming eight cents."""

Live-Cattle Futures Fall Sharply Amid Weaker Markets, Selling
Commodities Report
Live-Cattle Futures Fall Sharply Amid Weaker Markets, Selling","The Wall Street Journal J C13 English Copyright 2003 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. CHICAGO -- Live-cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fell sharply amid weaker cash cattle markets and selling from speculative funds. Both the front-month December and most-active February contracts fell by their 1.50-cent limits -- the former to 91.17 cents, the latter to 88.05. Lower prices paid for cash cattle late Wednesday and early yesterday contributed heavily to the initial declines in futures, floor traders and brokers said. After reports of sales of live cattle at 93 cents a pound sent futures down, some packers then reduced their bids to 92 cents, so the weaker markets fed off one another, the traders said. The early losses were extended as futures prices fell to sell stops, or sales orders placed in advance. February broke through the 50-day-moving-average -- a key level on price charts -- early in the session, then later dropped through last week's low of 88.10. Those breaches fueled additional selling. Dan Vaught, market analyst with A.G. Edwards, said the steep break in the nearby live-cattle contracts was largely the result of weaker-than-expected prices in the cash cattle markets this week. Cash-market sources said packers will need fewer cattle the next two weeks due to reduced slaughters during the holidays. Also, the beef plants are trying to recoup from recent losses. Their per-head slaughtering losses set new record daily and weekly average marks during the second week of this month. Retail promotions of beef have declined significantly during the last few weeks after wholesale-beef prices surged to all-time highs in October. Grocers could no longer afford to promote as much beef at the squeezed margins so they switched to more pork and chicken instead. That resulted in slowed movement of beef and depressed wholesale prices as well as demand for live cattle. In other commodity markets: COPPER: Futures rallied at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after news that Freeport McMoRan Copper &Gold declared a force majeure on copper concentrate sales from its Grasburg mine in Indonesia following an accident. Force majeure is a contractual clause absolving commodity producers from delivery commitments in extenuating circumstances. Traders said the market was also helped by gains in the stock market and by this week's solid U.S. economic data. March futures rose 1.85 cents a pound to $1.0150, setting a six-year high of $1.0185. WHEAT: Chicago Board of Trade futures rose after a late burst of speculative buying. News of strong weekly export sales gave the market a boost at the open, but buying interest waned and the market succumbed to the influence of weakness in the soybean market, before its final push higher. March futures rose 7.25 cents to $3.9325 a bushel."

Small-Stock Focus:Russell Retreats as Edison Schools, Kana Slide
Small-Stock Focus: Russell Retreats as Edison Schools, Kana Slide","The Wall Street Journal J C7 English (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -- In a day of givebacks, small-cap stocks fell somewhere between blue chips and large tech shares, although nobody lost more than they gained during Wednesday's monster rally. Smaller stocks fell a shade more than the Dow Jones Industrial Average but fared better than big technology issues. Being sandwiched is an unusual position for small caps; this year they have spent more time on the outside, with a clearer path to adding gains. But that has changed in the past couple of weeks, ever since the Standard & Poor's 600 SmallCap Index hit a record high in mid-April. The question is whether small stocks are taking a pause that will refresh and allow them to move even higher or beginning what technical analysts call a topping pattern, in which shares spend some time near their highs but then start pulling back. Yesterday it was a time for pulling back with the Russell 2000 Index of small-cap stocks falling 8.36 points, or 1.64%, to 501.39 and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index dropping 3.79, or 1.49%, to 250.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 45.80 points, or 2.70%, to 1650.49. The unusual softness for small caps is on the minds of money managers who acknowledge it is becoming harder to find good stocks at decent prices. But just as many small-cap strategists believe there is more room to go and that big-cap investors remain much more challenged. ""You have your Ciscos, but then it's a new day with more news,"" said Tom Philips, chief investment officer at Paradigm Asset Management, which invests money on behalf of small-cap investors. ""The news today was that Wal-Mart and other retailers had disappointing sales, which is largely a big-cap issue."" Also, during the day, word hit that International Business Machines, another big-cap stock, was planning another round of layoffs in its U.S. operations. Still, there are some events that send jitters through everyone. That happened yesterday, when news that Federal Reserve members, including Chairman Alan Greenspan, were sent mail containing anthrax spores. The letters were found at an off-site screening center. But stocks plunged on the news. Shares recovered their footing in early afternoon when Fed officials said the incident may have involved tainted machinery that contained old traces of anthrax or could even have been cases of false positives. That left stocks to their own devices, and they fell back into their old patterns, including late-day selling. In effect a reverse of Wednesday's broad buying, advances were marked by just 15 of 86 industry groups that Dow Jones follows. The day's biggest decliner was software with, among small caps, Ariba shedding 25 cents, or 7.5%, to 3.08, Entrust off 28 cents, or 6.6%, to 3.95 and FileNet down 1.48, or 8.7%, to 15.52. Biotechnology, a perennial decliner this year, found itself in a familiar position as the day's second-weakest sector. Among small caps, Affymetrix fell 1.75, or 6.8%, to 23.31, Advanced Tissue Sciences tumbled 34 cents, or 13%, to 2.35 and Incyte Genomics declined 77 cents, or 10%, to 7.25. The best performers were precious metals, although small caps' performance was mixed. Stillwater Mining dropped 67 cents, or 3.8%, to 16.82 while Meridian Gold edged up 18 cents, or 1.1%, to 16.36. Commodity chemicals were the second-best performers with small caps Georgia-Gulf rising 64 cents, or 2.8%, to 23.20 and A. Schulman gaining 70 cents, or 3.3%, to 22.27. Edison Schools was the Nasdaq's biggest percentage decliner, skidding 1.48, or 40%, to 2.22, an all-time low. The move continued a fall that began a couple of weeks ago when some of the New York public-school operator's effectiveness was questioned. This time, the decline came after a downgrade to ""market perform"" from ""outperform"" by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. The stock is ""fraught with near-term risk"" and has a ""muted"" longer-term outlook, said US Bancorp analyst Mark Marostica in a note to clients. Pacific Sunwear was an example of a small-cap retailer that folded, with shares dropping 2.92, or 12%, to 20.81. The Anaheim, Calif., casual-apparel seller said April same-store sales fell 6.7% and the company now expects first-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, below Wall Street estimates of 13 cents a share. Wells Fargo Securities cut the shares to ""market perform"" from ""strong buy."" Some of the software selling seemed company specific. Kana Software tumbled 1.97, or 21%, to 7.39 after the Menlo Park, Calif., business-systems developer abruptly announced its Chief Financial Officer Brett White was leaving. Mr. White's duties will be handled by Kana's vice president of finance, Joseph McCarthy, while the company looks for a successor. Crown Castle International was a big decliner on the Big Board, sliding 94 cents, or 16%, to 4.86. The Houston operator of wireless communications towers posted a first-quarter loss of 56 cents a share on $220.6 million of revenue when Wall Street was expecting a 45-cent loss. The Nasdaq's biggest percentage gainer was NaPro BioTherapeutics, ahead 2.44, or 45%, to 7.92. The Boulder, Colo., drug developer said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to make a generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Taxol injection cancer drug. Bristol-Myers (NYSE) fell 20 cents to 28.30."

Afghan Economic Adviser Has His Work Cut Out for Him --- Ex-World Bank Official Starts With Few
Funds And No Bank System","The Wall Street Journal J A19 English (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) KABUL, Afghanistan -- Apart from Osama bin Laden, Ashraf Ghani may be the only man in Afghanistan more harried than interim leader Hamid Karzai. The 58-year-old former anthropology professor and World Bank official is Mr. Karzai's senior economic adviser and head of the newly formed Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority, which is to oversee the $4.5 billion pledged to the country in January by wealthy nations meeting in Tokyo. Mr. Ghani, like his boss, has his work cut out for him. So far, none of the Tokyo money has arrived, and the government is living hand to mouth to meet its running costs. The government has received grants of as much as $10 million each from India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- which Mr. Karzai carried back in suitcases because there is no banking system in Kabul. The government also has $100 million in cash and $120 million in gold unfrozen by the U.S. in January (the Clinton administration froze those assets to punish the Taliban regime). Like much else in Afghanistan, the monetary system is in shambles. Three local currencies issued by various warlord factions are creating havoc and fueling inflation. Until a new currency is established, the IMF recommends the temporary use of dollars for key sectors such as project aid and government salaries. Mr. Karzai suggests the Euro, but no decision has been made. On city streets, thousands of unemployed crowd ministries and United Nation offices looking for jobs. Beggars have staked out houses where foreigners live, and Afghans holding university degrees work as drivers for foreign agencies. Most cities are utterly destroyed, with no running water, sewerage or central heating, and only intermittent electricity. Kabul still lies in thousands of acres of rubble. In the countryside roam 700,000 armed men who must be lured with jobs, education and aid to give up their weapons. For all that, Mr. Ghani is hopeful, even a little audacious. At a critical meeting with donors and U.N. agencies on Feb. 28, he issued a tough ultimatum: Kabul, not the donors, would set priorities and development agendas. ""We are fully committed to seeking partnership in this long-term process,"" he said, ""but we must demand that it be a partnership of equals."" While that miffed some donors, others understood. ""He was pretty ruthless,"" says a U.N. official. ""But now everyone agrees that what he said makes a lot of sense."" Mr. Ghani, a former professor of anthropology at Kabul University, left Afghanistan after the 1979 Soviet invasion and joined John Hopkins University. For the past eight years he has worked in the World Bank's Russia department, learning how donor countries and multilateral lenders operate. He asked for a leave of absence from the World Bank after Sept. 11, so he could help the U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, prepare for the Bonn conference in December that established the interim government. He has since left the World Bank and U.N. to join Mr. Karzai's government. ""The Authority will be the focal point until we can empower the different ministries to take over the task and make them self-sufficient,"" says Mr. Ghani. ""The purpose of this Authority is to work itself out of a job."" The Authority's first challenge will be establishing the financial transparency needed to win the confidence of donors, no easy task in a country where everything from jobs to investment is secured with kickbacks and tribal patronage. ""Procurement of raw materials lies at the heart of transparency,"" says Mr. Ghani. ""We are hiring an international firm for procurement, and donors must agree on unified rules for procurement."" Mr. Ghani, who despite ill health works 20-hour days, throws out ideas by the minute. He wants to use solar energy and mini-hydroelectric projects as the driving force for village development in order to save fuel and distribution costs. He is trying to set up a $100 million fund for the reconstruction of Kabul University with the help of the Carnegie Endowment and several U.S. universities. He is creating an Afghan Peace Corps to allow young, educated Afghans in the West to teach for six months in Afghan villages. That's not all he wants from expatriate Afghans. Given their money, expertise and technology, he wants them to take over ruined state industries and corporations, which he says will be privatized as quickly as possible. A senior Afghan pilot with a U.S. airline has arrived with American partners to take over the national airline, Ariana, which now has only one functioning plane. An Afghan engineer has come from Germany to advise on rebuilding destroyed canals, and a group of Afghan archeologists has arrived from the U.S. to help revive the Kabul Museum. On a recent, typical day, Afghan carpet importers waited to see Mr. Ghani in the musty, marbled former presidential palace that is his office. They have arrived from Europe to revive the country's carpet industry, and bring back weavers exiled in Pakistan and Iran. Also in line are tribal elders, Western CEOs, foreign-aid delegations, Afghan expatriates and assorted golddiggers, all looking for investment opportunities or just a chance to help their country. ""Everyone gets about 10 minutes with him,"" says a secretary."" That is all he has time for."""

Americas --- Above the U.S.: Canadian stocks last year outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe;
We're talking a lot more than `rocks and trees'","The Wall Street Journal J R13 English (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) It isn't often that Canadians get to boast about having one of the world's top-performing stock markets, but hot technology and communications stocks have put Canadian indexes in the limelight. Though Asian markets generally fared even better last year, Canada handily outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe. Many investors still think of Canada's stock market as a play on natural resources. However, surging shares of such high-tech names as Nortel Networks Corp., BCE Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corp. (with headquarters in both San Jose, Calif., and Nepean, Ontario) have pushed Canada's traditional sectors into the shadows over the past year. Technology and communications stocks accounted for about 51% of the weighting of the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index at the end of the first quarter. That compared with a weighting of just 15% for all of Canada's energy, mining and forest-products companies. Though some high-tech stocks have since plunged amid the sector's wobbles, telecom-equipment giant Nortel has seen its shares hold up well in the wake of strong earnings. The weighting of Canada's resource stocks in the TSE 300 has long been declining as commodity producers disappointed investors and companies in other fields prospered. The combined weighting of resource companies has fallen from 20% two years ago and 29% a decade ago. Over the past six months or so, many foreign investors ""have woken up to the fact that there's much more going on here than rocks and trees,"" says George Vasic, market strategist with Bunting Warburg Dillon Read Inc. in Toronto. Mr. Vasic says the TSE 300's heavy weighting in technology stocks makes it ""perhaps the second-greatest tech index"" behind the tech-drenched Nasdaq Composite Index in the U.S. The Canadian stock market spent most of the 1990s lagging well behind U.S. and international stock measures, but the pattern started to change last year, when the widely followed TSE 300 index jumped 29.7%, beating the 19.5% increase in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the U.S. In this year's first quarter, the TSE 300 rose about 12%, setting several records along the way, while the S&P 500 was up about 2%. The Canadian gains have been driven by a relatively small group of highly valued stocks, which have masked sluggish performances by natural resources, financial services and industrial stocks. Canadians are pouring their money into high-performing technology funds that invest in Canada and abroad, while flows of money into mutual funds with a broad base of holdings in Canadian companies have slowed to a trickle. The dichotomy in valuations between technology stocks and others is even more pronounced in Canada than in the U.S. The split has left value-minded fund managers coping with subpar returns and wondering how to drum up interest in the overlooked shares of nontech companies. Irwin Michael, a portfolio manager with ABC Funds in Toronto, says he has rarely seen so many companies with such low price/earnings and price/book value ratios. ""Canada's on sale waiting to be plucked"" by foreign acquirers, he says, pointing to shares of Canadian banks, oil producers and retailers. Some Canadian banks are going cheaply -- at about nine times expected earnings for this year -- while oil stocks have climbed only moderately and mining stocks have stubbornly refused to budge, despite a sharp climb in commodity prices in recent months. And some retailing stocks sell well below their book value, Mr. Michael adds. Meanwhile, Nortel, which recently traded at a multiple of more than 80 times expected earnings this year, has been leading the TSE 300's rise over the past year and dominating Canada's technology sector. The telecommunications-equipment giant has become a top technology pick in Canada and the U.S., commanding a market capitalization of about $250 billion Canadian (US$170 billion) recently. That means that Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, recently accounted for about one-fifth of the weighting of the TSE 300 index. While Nortel is an old company on a hot streak, many of the names driving the TSE 300 these days were virtually unknown a year ago. Take Research In Motion Ltd., a Waterloo, Ontario, maker of wireless communications devices, including the popular Blackberry wireless paging and electronic-mail device. Partly due to recent supply agreements with Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, and America Online Inc., Dulles, Va., shares of Research In Motion more than doubled in the first quarter to C$152, but were recently down below C$65. The shares traded at about C$10.40 a little over a year ago. Shares of fast-growing electronic-commerce company BCE Emergis Inc., majority-owned by Montreal-based telecom holding company BCE, shot up 32% in the first quarter, before giving back most of the gains. And shares of ATI Technologies Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, which makes computer chips for graphics applications, surged 35% in the first quarter, as the company announced deals to act as a supplier to Japan's Sony Corp. and others.  Mr. Heinzl is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Toronto bureau.  What You Need to Know Just a year or so ago, the gap between the sluggish Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index and the soaring Dow Jones Industrial Average seemed insurmountable to Canadian investors. The TSE 300 wallowed around 6500, while U.S. investors were celebrating the Dow's first surge through 10000. But the Canadian index has since been lifted by big gains in technology stocks (even with all the recent turmoil in the sector), while the U.S. barometer has cooled off. At a level of 9348 at the end of April, the TSE 300 was much closer to the Dow, at 10734, and Canadian market watchers generally expect further gains as Canada's economy continues to perform well. Regulation Canada has no national securities regulator, so provincial regulators oversee the nation's financial markets. The largest is the Ontario Securities Commission in Toronto, whose ability to police securities markets has been questioned by critics. Recently, however, the commission has shown signs that it's getting tougher: It has brought insider-trading charges against two prominent executives, one from a software company and one from a mining concern. Who Can Invest and How Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest exchange, are available to investors in any part of the world. Shares of many big Canadian companies, from telecommunications giant Nortel Networks Corp., Brampton, Ontario, to transportation concerns Bombardier Inc., Montreal, and Canadian Pacific Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, have long had listings both in Canada and in the U.S. Partly because of this ready access, many U.S. investors hold substantial stakes in Canadian companies, including cable operator Rogers Communications Inc., Toronto; film company Imax Corp., Toronto; and several natural-resources companies, such as gold producer Barrick Gold Corp., Toronto. U.S. investors commonly buy shares directly rather than through mutual funds. Fidelity Canada is devoted to the Canadian stock market, and many natural-resources funds or gold-mining funds in the U.S. have heavy exposure to Canadian companies. One easy way to invest in Canada's stock market is to buy shares of iUnits, which represent an investment in the S&P/TSE 60 Index, launched last year. The iUnits trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and give investors a stake in 60 of Canada's biggest companies, as measured by market cap. A similar index fund, Webs Canada, trades on the American Stock Exchange in New York. The Upside and Downside Despite the tech upheaval of recent weeks, Canada's stock market is heavily weighted toward technology and communications. Nortel alone, for example, hogs about one-quarter of the S&P/TSE 60. This provides both a risk and an opportunity for investors in the Canadian market, some analysts say. If tech shares hold their ground, there could be solid returns still to come in the market as valuations firm up in banking, natural resources and other areas. If tech stocks crumble further, however, Canada's stock indexes will struggle to hold their gains.

For a Bear in Texas, Stocks' PlungeIs Honey but Not Yet Vindication

TEXAS JOURNAL
For a Bear in Texas, Stocks' Plunge Is Honey but Not Yet Vindication","The Wall Street Journal J Texas Journal T2 English (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) After last week's technology-stock crash, one might have guessed champagne corks were popping at the Dallas headquarters of David W. Tice & Associates. No way, says Mr. Tice, one of the nation's most outspoken bears. He has officially declared his office a no-gloating zone. Not that he didn't have reason to be pleased. Thanks to the past month's jitters, Mr. Tice once again is getting his day in the sun. From March 10, the day the Nasdaq Composite Index peaked at an intra-day high of 5132.52, through the end of last week, Mr. Tice's Prudent Bear Fund soared 21.5%, the second-best performance by any U.S. diversified equity mutual fund over that time period, according to Lipper Inc. That's because the $215 million fund he manages is geared primarily toward betting that stock prices will drop, or short selling, which benefits from market downturns. Last week, the fund was up 23.4%, making it the top one-week performer during a stretch when the Nasdaq Composite fell 25.3%. Of course, this has been a long time coming. For years, Mr. Tice's bets against the bullish tide have been dead wrong. That in part explains why he isn't exactly celebrating just yet. And if past investor behavior is any indication, the good times for Prudent Bear holders could be short-lived. Just Monday, for instance, Prudent Bear gave up 4.4% of its value, finishing at $4.33 a share, compared with the Nasdaq Composite's 6.6% gain that day. And yesterday the Nasdaq Composite gained 7.2% to close at 3793.57. In a memo e-mailed to his 23 employees over the weekend, Mr. Tice cautioned his staff not to rub in the recent gains when hobnobbing around town. ""I believe I have told you how careful we have to be when the market starts going our way,"" Mr. Tice wrote. ""Now is that time. It should affect how we act with our friends in a bar or at a restaurant or at a hockey game because others will be observing. With the Nasdaq market down more last week than any week in history, it's time to be careful. Lots of bulls have been obnoxious. But we can never celebrate openly."" Nor does he feel anywhere near vindicated just yet. After all, despite its swoon, the Nasdaq Composite at Friday's close was still up 32% from a year earlier. Mr. Tice, by comparison, has been publicly sounding alarms about stock-market bubbles since 1994. Indeed, through last week, Prudent Bear had produced an average annual loss of 17% for the previous three years. This means that an investor who plunked $1,000 into Mr. Tice's no-load fund in April 1997 finished last week with only about $570 to show for it. The fund's one-year return, through Friday, was a hair under 5%. ""We were so early, it's not like we've been proved right yet,"" says the 45-year-old Mr. Tice. During the summer of 1998, when the broader market also was in bearish territory, Mr. Tice was warning that a global economic meltdown would send shivers through the U.S. economy, pointing to such warning signs as the Asian financial collapse, economic troubles in Russia, rampant manufacturing overcapacity and sluggish energy prices that were causing pains for some developing nations. Today, his concerns are just as pointed: Americans' credit is overextended. Foreign investors may pull out of U.S. stocks now that there's a chink in the armor. Tech-stock valuations, which he and others believed to be outrageous and unsustainable a few years ago, are even more so today in his view. Inflation is rising, signaling future interest-rate boosts and a weaker U.S. dollar. And in a prolonged bear market, the much-discussed ""wealth effect"" created by recent market gains could be turned on its head, curbing consumer confidence and spending. At least for the past month, Mr. Tice's short-selling strategy has been a winning one. (In a short sale, an investor bets on falling prices by borrowing shares of stock and immediately selling them, hoping to profit by buying back shares at lower prices at some point in the future.) Among the stocks that fueled Prudent Bear's recent gains: cellular-phone maker Qualcomm, now down 44% from its 52-week high at $118.188; RF Micro Devices, a maker of wireless-communications equipment, off 47% at $97.313; chip manufacturer Rambus, down 68% at $152; and e-commerce reservations booker priceline.com, down 61% at $64. All four, in Mr. Tice's view, still have much further to fall. Qualcomm, for one, still trades for more than 260 times trailing earnings. And priceline.com continues to use what he sees as aggressive revenue-recognition practices; namely, it includes the cost of an airline ticket, for instance, in its own top-line revenue results, as it's collecting the brokering fee for booking a reservation. Priceline contends its accounting is sound because unlike travel agents, it does take ownership of tickets for a short period during the transaction. Mr. Tice last year issued a report critical of accounting practices at Tyco International, sending its stock plunging. Tyco in December disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an inquiry into its accounting. The company has denied that its accounting was improper and has said it is cooperating with the SEC. Mr. Tice declines to say what other companies his fund currently is shorting, but he does point to several examples of stocks on which he is decidedly bearish. Mr. Tice says he is sour on International Business Machines, currently down 17% from its 52-week high at $115.125. He envisions slowing sales and heightened competition combined with declining profitability from personal-computer sales at IBM. Chase Manhattan, down 20% from its peak at $80.75, could be headed for more declines, he says, partly due to downturns in the value of its venture-capital holdings. And he cautions that storage-systems maker EMC, down 10% from its high at $129.875, remains overvalued at 136 times trailing earnings in an industry also marked by increasing competition and falling product prices. If he is right, Mr. Tice promises, there won't be any crowing. ""People don't like to be told `I told you so' when they're losing a lot of money,"" he says. ""History has taught us that excesses in the financial system have to be wrung out. This is just the beginning. It will take a period of years. And it will be very painful. Because of that, it's hard to feel celebratory.""  Rough Landing: Kitty Hawk fell 93.6% last week to 28.1 cents a share. Last week the Dallas air-cargo company said it will miss a debt payment, blaming high maintenance costs and slower growth in the first quarter. It is negotiating with lenders and considering selling assets.  Safety Plays: Investors last week ducked into some out-of-favor Texas stocks at the same time that recent highfliers were getting dumped. Service Corp. International, the Houston funeral-home chain, jumped 36.7% last week to $4.188. And inflation concerns sparked a 25.9% rise in Houston-based Battle Mountain Gold, to $2.125. Small-capitalization biotechnology companies like Interleukin Genetics, San Antonio, and Energy Biosystems, The Woodlands, lost more than half their value.  Nose Dive: Dallas-based i2 Technologies fell 43% last week to $78.063, reflecting a sectorwide downturn in business-to-business e-commerce stocks."
j000000020010807dw3e006td,13 March 2000,UNKNOWN,"The Wall Street Journal J B19J English (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) OTTAWA (Reuters) -- Some of Canada's best-known birds are set to become extinct -- on the country's bank notes, at least. The loon, beloved denizen of Canada's lakes, will keep its safe nesting place on the back of the dollar coin, commonly known as the ""loonie,"" said an official at the Royal Canadian Mint. But on the nation's bank notes the belted kingfisher, osprey, common loon, snowy owl and Canada goose will soon be gone, victims of a redesign of the country's colorful $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills, the Bank of Canada said. Canada's bills have been bedecked with birds since 1986. They are being redesigned to better prevent counterfeiting, with the new series set for release in 2001, the central bank said. ""The new design itself is still being worked on and we're not, for security reasons, in a position to announce a particular content of the design until much closer to 2001,"" Bank of Canada currency educator Bill Cook said. He said the bank was polling Canadians about their views on what should be pictured on the back of the bills, which previously have portrayed allegorical figures, landscapes and industries, as well as birds in the current series. Depictions of famous Canadians are an option, Mr. Cook said. The front of the blue, purple, green, red and brown bills currently depicts stylized numerals as well as a portrait of either Queen Elizabeth or former Canadian prime ministers. Mr. Cook declined to say whether the portraits, which were also on the previous series of notes, will be kept, but he noted that portraits are found on almost every nation's banknotes because they are engraved and thus difficult to counterfeit. The central bank reportedly tested the popularity of the removal of the Queen's portrait from the bills through polling, and found opinion evenly split -- so the Queen will stay on at least one of the notes. A spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mint, which designs and produces Canada's coin currency, said there are no plans to shoo the loon from the trademark gold-colored dollar coin. ""We're not removing the loon,"" Pierre Morin said."

Reappoint Greenspan Now
Reappoint Greenspan Now","The Wall Street Journal J A22 English (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) A week ago the Federal Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first time in 2 1/2 years. Under different circumstances, this would probably have had a dampening effect, yet the markets rallied sharply, taking comfort in the perception that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates again soon. Commodity prices, led by gold, copper and oil, all jumped significantly, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed Friday at a record high before falling 4.12 points yesterday. Whether the Fed was right to raise rates is a matter of legitimate debate. But the reaction of the markets points to the delicate position in which the Fed now finds itself: What it says (or seems to say) is as important to the economy as what it does. This is not a new phenomenon, but two factors have combined to accentuate its significance. First, the surprising duration of the current economic expansion is causing anxiety about how much longer it can last. Second, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has come to be seen as the economy's indispensable man, and the prospect that he might depart when his term expires next June is creating uncertainty about the future course of monetary policy. Taken together, this is a potent recipe for economic trouble -- the most effective remedy for which is for President Clinton to reappoint Mr. Greenspan at once to another term. By most indications, the U.S. economy is the picture of health. But there are disquieting signs of danger. The American consumer has become the consumer of first and last resort for the world. With wage and salary income soaring at 6% annually and consumer prices rising at only about 2.5%, the consumer is flush. But even this ample cash flow has not been enough to satisfy consumer spending habits. Households are increasing their spending faster than their incomes are rising, liquidating a portion of their wealth, or going into debt, to finance the difference. In addition, corporate cash flow is no longer covering business investment. The borrowing needs of the private sector have far outstripped both available private-sector saving and the federal budget surplus. The result is an unprecedented private-sector reliance on foreign inflows of capital. Without such inflows, the American private sector could no longer finance its current level of economic activity. This borrowing need is not only large but growing. Last year our net indebtedness to foreigners rose by more than $200 billion. By the end of this year we may see that number approach a $400 billion annual rate. By the end of next year, if the economy does not slow, we will be relying on foreign financing for nearly $600 billion a year. As our borrowing needs grow, so does the price we pay for the money. Even before the Fed acted, the cost to the Treasury of 30-year money had risen 140 basis points from its low last fall. This is not necessarily bad, but it is imprudent. It means that the fate of the private economy is being held hostage to foreign developments. Heightened credit demands in Asia or Europe, or a perceived weakening in the dollar, would have immediate and profound effects on our economy. The Fed must have the full freedom of movement to preempt such a situation. The Fed must also find its way through a variety of confusing crosscurrents in our so-called New Economy. One of the most important is the use of options as a form of employee compensation. Many employers now give employees throughout the company stock options in lieu of significant pay increases. This has the positive effect of increasing the employee's stake in the firm's performance. Employees have no complaints given the recent performance of the equity markets. But the widespread use of options sends a number of confusing signals to decision makers. Options are not counted as ""compensation"" either in the national income accounts or on the firm's profit-and-loss statement. As such, wage data can suggest that employment costs are contained, when in fact they are growing quite rapidly. Furthermore, corporate profitability can be easily overstated since compensation costs can be paid in ""free"" money -- promises of corporate stock that appear not to dilute shareholder value. The combined effect is to create the appearance of a benign economic environment underneath which assets and liabilities are becoming increasingly mismatched. The Fed also faces confusing signals on productivity. There are many reasons to believe that we may be understating productivity in some high-technology areas. But we are also not correctly measuring the decline in quality of customer service resulting from labor shortages, downsizing and the increasing use of workers with subpar language, math and social skills. The addition of these new workers to the labor force, while socially very beneficial, imposes a cost that is not counted in the traditional productivity calculation. But the Fed's problems are not only economic. During his most recent congressional testimony, Mr. Greenspan was assailed for daring to raise rates just as the American worker was starting to benefit from the current expansion. Politicians of varied political stripes will increasingly find the Fed an easy target as the campaign season heats up. Should the bond market come to feel that Fed policy is being dictated by political considerations, the economic consequences would be severe. Complicating this still further is the prospect of Mr. Greenspan's departure. In this regard, Mr. Clinton has three options. First, he could choose to nominate someone else. That would send a clear vote of no confidence and is sure to upset the markets. Then too, the chances are slim to none that the Senate would confirm an entirely new nominee of a lame-duck president from the opposite party. Thus, nominating someone other than Mr. Greenspan is both dangerous for the economy and politically futile. Second, Mr. Clinton could announce that the next president should choose the next chairman, leaving Mr. Greenspan to serve as a lame duck. There is some political merit in this, especially since the term as chairman would no longer come up during a presidential election year. But these considerations are far outweighed by the economic risks. Leaving the choice of chairman to the next president would politicize the issue of monetary policy while creating dangerous uncertainties about its future. This is not a recipe for stability. The third option, of course, is to renominate Mr. Greenspan. The only question is when. Waiting until his current term expires would place his confirmation hearings at the height of the political season. In the meantime the markets would be free to speculate about behind the scenes deals between the Fed and the White House, thus eroding the perception of the Fed's independence. It is exactly what the markets, the economy, and the country cannot afford. There is, then, only one thing that Mr. Clinton can do that would both remove monetary policy from politics and alleviate the current uncertainty in markets: renominate Mr. Greenspan now. The combined effect of his reappointment by a Democratic president and his confirmation by a Republican Senate would signal to global markets that American monetary policy has a stable bipartisan basis. It would allow the Fed to concentrate on the difficult task at hand, free of political distraction. And it would leave a legacy worthy of any president.  Mr. Lindsey, a former governor of the Federal Reserve, is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute."

The Millennium---Leisure:What Money Can Buy---One era's luxury is another's squalor; A look at palaces through the ages
The Millennium --- Leisure: What Money Can Buy --- One era's luxury is another's squalor; A look at
palaces through the ages","The Wall Street Journal J R36 English (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Sultan Murat III was ruler of his world in the 16th century, enthroned in a white-domed palace with 300 rooms for his wives and concubines and 4,000 stalls for his horses. But when it comes to creature comforts, the Turkish sultan's palace was nothing compared with those of modern millionaires like Leona Helmsley. When she had a mansion built in Arizona, Ms. Helmsley included faucets of 24-karat gold, a glass-walled dining room overlooking a waterfall, a film-projection system that lowers from the ceiling, and an underwater sound system for the swimming pool. What defines luxury has changed drastically over the past 1,000 years. Monarchs and moguls have always had scads of servants to pamper and protect them, but generally were expected to house and feed their retinues in vast compounds. So peace and quiet -- things most middle-class Americans take for granted -- were in short supply. So, too, were comfort and privacy. A powerful, rich person might sit all day on a gilded throne and sleep on silk sheets, but was always on display. Never could the rich experience the total relaxation of modern wage slaves, channel-surfing from their recliners in ratty sweatsuits. Palaces were primitive in other ways, too. Many of the niceties of modern home life were invented in the past two centuries -- not just air conditioning and electric lights and appliances, but also flush toilets and even window screens, for example. So until recently, even the grandest residences tended to be dim, drafty and vulnerable to vermin. But comfort wasn't the goal. Palaces were built to awe, and to last. They were monuments as much as domiciles, works of art and inspiration in a time before mass-media amusements. Here is a look at palatial home life over the past 1,000 years. England Windsor Castle Now a compound covering 13 acres and displaying some of the world's finest artwork, architecture and furnishings, Windsor Castle started as an earthwork-and-timber fortification built by William the Conqueror around 1080 to guard the Thames River. Its layout was simple -- a mound, or ""motte,"" surrounded by a fenced yard, or ""bailey."" But its site, near a 4,800-acre royal hunting ground and about 20 miles west of London, was considered so favorable, his successors turned it into a permanent residence. Although the residence now has every modern comfort -- along with elaborate plaster carvings, gilded trim, and damask wall and window coverings -- for the first three centuries of its existence it was a humble affair, and life within it was hardly luxurious. There were improvements made during that time. In 1170, Henry II starting replacing the original timber structures with stone. Setting the style for succeeding architects, he had a round stone tower with crenelated battlements built on the raised motte William had created, and added two sets of apartments -- one with a hall to receive his court, another just for his family. Over the next two centuries, his successors added five round towers to the outside wall, expanded the royal apartments, and created a chapel and a great hall for the Knights of the Garter. But it was still a Norman castle -- thick-walled, dark and dank, says Lisa Reilly, associate professor of architectural history at the University of Virginia. The only light came from candles and torches, and though rich tapestries covered the walls and expensive glass was used in some windows, they weren't enough to dispel the constant drafts. Floors were cold, too, because carpets were considered too precious and delicate to throw on the floor -- they were more likely to be used as wall or table coverings. And smoke and smells from meat roasting on spits in the huge fireplaces permeated the air. Roasting meat was one of the better smells in the castle. Baths were infrequent, and even the elite wore clothes a long time before washing them. Built-in latrines jutted out of the wall over the moat, which consequently reeked. People casually let food drop to the rush-strewn floor, where, if not picked up by the resident hounds or falcons, it rotted. ""It was pretty gross,"" says Prof. Reilly. Medieval courts were constantly on the move, so rulers could keep a high profile with their subjects, and they carried their most precious furnishings with them, down to the gold plates and crystal goblets. Entertainments tended to be portable, too, and included hunting, jousting, falconry, cards, dice, chess, needlework and lawn bowling. For all their power, rulers rarely had any time to themselves. Hundreds lived in the castle, and even at bedtime, when the royals retired to their fur-covered featherbed, surrounded by a linen curtain, they weren't alone: Servants bedded down in the same room on trundle beds, alert to any royal whisperings. ""The idea of privacy had yet to evolve,"" Prof. Reilly says. China Imperial Palace The constant threat of barbarian invasion caused Chinese emperors to move their capital a number of times early in the millennium. And although Beijing was the site from the years 1260 to 1368, it wasn't until the capital returned there in the early 15th century that Yong Le, the third Ming emperor, created a permanent imperial residence. Built by some 200,000 laborers, this in time became an 8,886-room complex on a rectangle measuring 3,150 by 2,460 feet. Over the next five centuries, the 180-acre compound was home to 24 successive emperors. Although it was known as the Forbidden City, many servants and tradespeople came and went daily; only 9,000 people resided there full time. Architects used the ancient Chinese philosophy of feng shui -- literally ""wind-water,"" it's the art of arranging buildings and furnishings for good fortune and success -- to lay out the palace and grounds in harmony with nature. Most buildings face south to benefit from sunny yang and counteract harmful yin from the north, such as cold winds, bad spirits and barbarian invaders. Streets run either north-south or east-west. Moats, walls and four gates at the cardinal points -- north, south, east and west -- protected the city from the outside world. The buildings, made from timber, brick, stone and marble, were less than two stories tall, so as not to disturb the spirits of the air. In the inner reaches of the city, ceremonial pavilions and three palaces reserved for the emperor and his wives and concubines were decorated with gilt and carvings of dragons, cranes and other ""lucky"" beasts. In its early years, the palace probably had translucent paper windows, rather than glass -- and no screens to keep out insects, of course. ""They had servants to swat the flies,"" says Richard Stamps, a professor of Chinese studies at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich. The palaces were constantly warmed and perfumed by braziers in which incense was burned -- a reasonable measure, given that the outer courtyards held livestock, including pigs and sheep, and the emperor's 48 elephants. But conditions weren't as unhygienic as in some Western cities, thanks to a system of crude slot-in-the-ground toilets, septic tanks and waste drains, according to Prof. Stamps. ""Farmers would take away the waste and spread it on their fields for fertilizer,"" he says. Ritual ruled the emperor's day. Typically, he arose each day at 3 a.m. and received visitors or presided over parades and ceremonies nonstop until lunchtime. At noon he dined alone. Because the main kitchens were so far away from the emperor's quarters, his food often arrived cold, prompting one emperor to have a small warming kitchen built near his dining room. But imperial banquets were worse -- tedious affairs for both the emperor, on whom all eyes were riveted, and for the guests, who were expected to bang their heads on the floor whenever the host said anything amusing or even when he was served something to drink. According to ""The Forbidden City: Center of Imperial China"" by Gilles Beguin and Dominique Morel, an 18th-century priest once complained after attending an imperial banquet: ""There are those magnificent meals where a European dies of hunger. The way in which he is forced to sit on the ground on a mat with crossed legs is awkward; neither the wine nor the dishes that are offered are to his taste . . . . One would initially say that it was an idol to whom a sacrifice was going to be made rather than a prince to whom food was being served."" The emperor and his retinue enjoyed beautiful, albeit artificial, gardens (trees out of season were sometimes decorated with silk blossoms), numerous temples and shrines, a library and a dozen theaters. But because he spent his days in ceremonies, was often carried on a covered litter called a palanquin and was required to nibble on multicourse meals, the emperor had limited opportunities to exercise -- one reason that the various thrones dotting the complex, made of gold or jade and padded with yellow silk, were exceptionally capacious. Turkey Topkapi Palace The spectacular view continues to be of the confluence of the Golden Horn, the Bosporus Strait and the Sea of Marmara, but Topkapi Palace itself has been been through many transformations. It has been swept over the years by four major fires and endless renovations and expansions. Although Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror moved to Topkapi in 1465, much of the current compound, including the famous harem, was built by Sultan Murat III in the late 1500s. The 54-acre walled compound embodied a new idea for the Ottomans: that the sultan was sacred and should keep his distance from the masses. But though the sultans kept aloof, they hardly lived alone. For the 500 years the Ottoman sultans resided there, it was a swarming place, though exceptionally well-organized. ""Even the horses seem to know where they are,"" wrote a traveler named Tourenfort in 1700. Within the compound's walls, many stone kiosks recall nomadic tents. Most of the buildings are low, with overhanging eaves; they make the palace look as though it is clinging to the side of the cliff. The compound included 10 mosques, 14 baths, and two hospitals, plus an armory, a mint, a school, a circumcision room, a fountain to cleanse the blood from the executioner's ax, various dormitories for servants, and a zoo containing such exotic wild animals as lions and elephants. A series of kitchens served 5,000 full-time residents, who consumed more than 300 sheep or goats and 650 fowl daily, nibbled on a new cheese called feta, and sampled fruits and other delicacies brought in from all over the empire. More than 100 cartloads of wood had to be hauled in daily to feed the kitchen's roaring stoves. In an inner compound, away from the clatter of the kitchens and the bustle of tradesmen who served the palace, 300 warren-like rooms in the well-guarded harem held some 2,000 people -- the sultan's mother, wives, concubines and children. Since many of the occupants spent much of their lives sitting on silk rugs or pillows, windows were placed low, and the rooms were on raised bases to maximize views of the courtyard gardens. The sultan's mother and wives had several apartments, but most concubines slept three or four to a room. The harem surrounded the apartments of the sultan, richly decorated in brocades, murals, stained-glass windows and intricately carved furniture, with many fountains that made it difficult to eavesdrop on his conversations. (Some visitors complained that it was uncomfortable to walk on the Oriental carpets, which were sewn with jewels.) The sultan's domed bedroom was warmed by a bronze fireplace and window shutters inlaid with mother-of-pearl; in the basement was a pool fed by various fountains, which functioned as a cool summer retreat. Beautiful as it was, Topkapi was nevertheless a prison for all who lived there. Sultans did as they pleased, sending rival brothers and sons to the executioner, or banishing them to a life of forced ease in the harem. But even the sultan's life was circumscribed by constant calls to prayer and by idle pursuits such as archery or watching fireworks, according to a Venetian visitor to the court of Murat III in 1585 as described in ""Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: the Topkapi Palace in the 15th and 16th Centuries"" by Gulru Necipoglu. ""The sultan does not, in my opinion, live so desirable a life,"" wrote the visitor, ""for he stays almost constantly enclosed in his seraglio in the company of eunuchs, boys, dwarfs, mutes and slaves, which seems to me almost as bad as [the company of] women . . . ."" Russia Catherine Palace When Peter the Great established his capital in St. Petersburg in 1703, he attracted a number of Italian architects who unleashed a wave of baroque and neoclassical building unrivaled anywhere in Europe. Two of his imperial successors, Elizabeth and Catherine II (the Great), shared his passion for building, and between them erected a number of monumental palaces. One, known in different eras as the Great Palace, the Ekaterinsky Palace or the Catherine Palace, was at Tsarkoe Selo about 25 miles from the city. It was named for Peter the Great's second wife, and Elizabeth's mother, Catherine I. The palace was 978 feet long, with two small wings of about 50 feet each. Almost overpowering in scale, its three-story facade was broken up by a series of balustrades, columns and pediments. The stuccoed walls were turquoise, the columns white, and all the exterior ornamentation and statues were gilded. (European contemporaries scoffed at the glittering effect the original architects created -- an English traveler called it ""most tawdry"" -- and Catherine II had most of the gilding removed after Elizabeth died.) Meant to impress rather than to repel invaders, the palace had a purely decorative drawbridge and parklike grounds ringed only with iron fences and canals. The parks contained a number of art galleries and pavilions, as well as a theater, cold baths, a church and an orangery. Catherine II used the palace as her main summer residence, and despite her distaste for gilding, spared little expense ornamenting her interiors in the latest neoclassical style. In her private apartments, walls were covered with lapis lazuli and damask silk, and parquet floors were inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The walls of her own bedroom were made of milky-white glass, punctuated by lilac-colored glass columns, mirrors and Wedgwood medallions. The palace sported some state-of-the-art conveniences, such as ceramic-tile-covered wood-burning stoves that were both more efficient and less smoky than traditional open fireplaces, and private toilets. But there was still no running water -- for either the toilets or the rest of the palace -- and food was brought in from a separate building by serfs. Still, imperial life was more relaxed for Catherine II than it had been for earlier rulers, in Russia and elsewhere. Though an estimated 400 people lived in the palace when the court was in residence, many servants lived outside the palace grounds (which covered 1,483 acres and included 100 buildings), thus reducing the number of prying eyes. And livestock was banished from the parks, cutting down on noise and filth. Informal entertainments such as outdoor concerts and picnics were gaining in popularity. These were hardly rustic affairs, though: According to William Craft Brumfield, professor of Russian studies at Tulane University in New Orleans, servants set tables on the lower levels of the outdoor pavilions and then winched them up to the elite guests on the upper levels, so as not to disturb the guests' contemplation of nature. Catherine II considered herself an enlightened ruler and adopted many new ideas, such as the notion of privacy -- at least for herself. Indeed, she even placed her own apartments at the opposite end of the immense palace from those of her son, the Grand Duke Paul. ""Nothing was allowed to intrude on her, not even her children,"" says Prof. Brumfield. U.S. Biltmore Estate By the late 19th century, American tycoons were living as lavishly as monarchs. One who decided to build a country palace worthy of any prince was George Washington Vanderbilt, grandson of industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt. Though now open to the public, the estate is still in family hands. A linguist, musician and patron of the arts, George Vanderbilt built his 250-room mansion on 125,000 acres overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains. (The estate today is a mere 8,000 acres.) Richard Morris Hunt, a pre-eminent architect, designed the house to look like a castle from the Loire Valley, and Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape architect, created formal and informal gardens on 250 acres. Mr. Vanderbilt had a special railroad spur built to deliver the tons of Indiana limestone and other materials needed at the construction site, as well as the massive collection of antiques, artwork and Oriental carpets used to furnish the completed house. Begun in 1890 and finished five years later, the mansion was probably the most innovative residence of its day. It used some of Thomas Edison's first light bulbs, and had other new electrical wonders, such as two elevators, a fire-alarm system, a rotisserie, refrigeration systems, and call boxes for servants. It also sported such state-of-the-art features as 10 telephones and central heating powered by a huge steam furnace. Air conditioning hadn't yet been developed, but Biltmore had electric fans, a new invention. The 43 bathrooms provided hot water on demand, a remarkable innovation. Biltmore was also a prototype of what has now become a common sight in wealthy neighborhoods: the pleasure palace. For recreation, there was an indoor swimming pool, billiard room, bowling alley and gymnasium. For entertaining, there was a banquet hall that seated 64 guests, a conservatory filled with tropical flowers, a library of 23,000 books, and a number of sitting rooms filled with paintings by such artists as Albrecht Durer, John Singer Sargent and Pierre Auguste Renoir. As much as possible, the estate was set up to be self-sufficient, growing many of its own vegetables and raising cattle to provide beef and dairy products. And while visitors to palaces in previous centuries might have had to endure the sights and smells of various support systems, at Biltmore such things were kept hidden or at a distance. Even the three kitchens and the laundry were sequestered on a lower level, where guests were unlikely to stumble upon them. The protocol of the era precluded the sort of dress-down comfort modern moguls favor; everyone at Biltmore was expected to wear elegant gowns or black tie to dinner and to behave with decorum even when at play. But in every other way, Biltmore's owner achieved what royalty couldn't, even over the course of 1,000 years -- a paradise free of both the trappings of state and the unsettling view of the workers and machinery that made all the luxuries possible. Pauline Merrill, a guest at Biltmore in 1905, summed up her visit in terms that have, in effect, become today's standard for luxury living: ""Absolutely everything unpleasant has been eliminated."" The 20th-Century Ideal Since Biltmore's time, a new era has dawned: In the 20th century, most in-home luxuries quickly have become everyday conveniences for the masses. Not until 1913 was the first residential air-conditioning system installed: Industrialist Charles Gates (no relation to Bill) had it put in his Minneapolis mansion. Unfortunately, he died before he ever used it, and air conditioning in homes didn't really take off until the 1950s. Today, though, this once unheard-of luxury is an affordable amenity in much of the developed world. Ditto for a whole array of creature comforts. Electric vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines, clothes dryers, dishwashers, color television -- all dream products just a few generations ago -- have become inexpensive and democratized, thanks to improved technology and mass production. For the first decade or so after color television was introduced in the 1950s, only the well-to-do had the pocket money to splurge on such an extravagance. Nowadays, even many households of modest means own several. Much the same goes for personal computers -- except that the time from when they were introduced to when they became commonplace in homes narrowed to a mere decade. Whirlpool baths, invented by Roy Jacuzzi in 1968, were rarely found anywhere but millionaires' mansions as recently as the late 1980s; now they're upgrades in tract houses. Indeed, the proliferation of luxury products has blurred class barriers. ""Whatever other problems we now have, one of the saving graces has been the elimination of profound differences between the rich and the poor,"" writes Ruth Schwartz Cowan, author of ""More Work for Mother."" So, what does it take now to have a luxury home the rest of us can only dream about? Well, how about a 5,000-square-foot glass orchid conservatory, like the one former Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. Chairman Michael S. Egan installed off the master bedroom of his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., home? Or maybe a screening room, manmade lake and boathouse, as in the Miami mansion renovated by movie star Sylvester Stallone? And then there's the main pad of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, a palace with 1,788 rooms (including a banquet room that seats 500), a garage for 150 Rolls-Royces and air-conditioned stalls for 200 ponies. But for the very latest, 21st-century features, even these mansions pale in comparison with the $53.4 million underground home built by -- who else? -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates in Redmond, Wash. His estate has all the standard luxuries, as it were, including a theater, a big pool, a trampoline room, an arcade and a dock for water skiing. But thanks to dozens of powerful PCs, it's also programmed to please: Residents or guests can wear special lapel pins, encoded with their particular tastes, that change the electronic artwork ""hanging"" on walls, control the music and adjust the temperature and lighting to their tastes as they move from room to room.
