{"title": "Stocks, Dollar Nosedive As Trump Flogs Fed --- Dow index falls 972 as president's swipes at Powell exacerbate investors' tariff fears", "date": "22 April 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "The stock market plunged and the dollar hit fresh lows against major currencies on Monday, after President Trump renewed his attacks on the Federal Reserve and intensified the \"sell America\" trade. The president's renewed threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term doesn't expire for another year, exacerbated turmoil wrought by the administration's trade restrictions. Trump demanded on Monday lower interest rates in a post on social media, saying that the economy could slow \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\" Trump himself nominated Powell as Fed chair during his first term. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 972 points Monday and is on pace for its worst April since 1932. The dollar hit fresh multiyear lows against the euro and other major currencies. Yields on longer-term Treasurys, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed. Oil prices slid. Gold hit a record. After the markets closed in the U.S., stock futures rose, while Asian stocks were slightly lower. Threats to Powell's job marked a new source of uncertainty for investors, who said eroding confidence in the independence of the U.S. central bank could deal a significant blow to the value of stocks, bonds and the dollar. While Trump made similar threats against the Fed in his prior term, investors now worry that Trump's tariffs could rekindle pandemic-era inflation, requiring the central bank to keep rates higher, not lower. Some worry that recent declines in stocks, bonds and the dollar -- which has become known as the sell America trade -- point to a shift in capital flows that undermines the U.S.'s longstanding primacy in global markets. \"It is concerning,\" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, of the broad-based declines. \"The bigger issue people are trying to assess: Is the bloom truly off the U.S. exceptionalism trade just in the short run, or is it going to be an intermediate or longer-term factor?\" The Dow industrials fell by 2.5%, the S&P 500 lost 2.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed about 2.6%. Investors sold tech stocks and shares of companies that make goods like electronics or clothing that consumers tend to cut back on when times get tough. Particularly hard-hit were the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies that had helped power major indexes higher in recent years. Nvidia lost 4.5% and was among the biggest decliners in the blue-chip index. Amazon.com fell 3.1%. The past few months have been particularly punishing for Tesla, which fell around 5.8% Monday. Its shares have now erased all of their postelection gains and have plummeted 44% in 2025 so far. On Monday, Tesla dropped outside of the largest 10 U.S. companies by market value for the first time since June 2024. The electric-vehicle maker is grappling with slower sales and a damaged brand, with Chief Executive Elon Musk's prominent role in the Trump administration alienating some customers. The company is set to report earnings Tuesday. Analysts are expecting a year-over-year drop in profit, FactSet estimates show. Stocks and other riskier assets had shown some signs of stability last week after Trump announced a 90-day pause on many tariffs. Still, investors remain nervous about the lack of developments in trade negotiations, with some saying calming investors will require substantial progress in a short time. An early set of data from trade bellwether South Korea showed a big drop in exports to the U.S. this month."}

{"title": "Markets: Dow Nears the Worst April Since 1932", "date": "22 April 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "The Trump rout is taking on historic dimensions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed almost 1,000 points on Monday and is headed for its worst April performance since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 index's performance since Inauguration Day is now the worst for any presidential term on record in data going back to 1928, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Worries about trade restrictions and the prospect of President Trump firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have investors bracing for greater losses ahead. Corporate earnings reports are rolling in, along with executives' tariff-dented financial outlooks for the months ahead. Few executives think the administration's negotiations with trade partners will yield results soon enough to ease the strain. Meanwhile, counterweights that usually strengthen when stocks fall -- like government bonds and the U.S. dollar -- are also under pressure, leaving investors with few havens to wait out the storm. \"It's the hallmark of the 'no confidence' trade,\" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. The Charlotte-based firm trimmed its U.S. equity position several weeks ago to favor more international stocks. \"It's impossible to commit capital to an economy that is unstable and unknowable because of policy structure,\" Ladner said. Here is how markets have reacted as threats have multiplied: Stocks In the weeks after Donald Trump's presidential victory, major U.S. stock indexes soared, lifted by investors' hopes for tax cuts and a deregulatory push that could boost corporate earnings. But the administration instead pressed ahead with aggressive tariffs that threaten to raise prices and slow economic growth. Many investors still wrote off the president's threats as mere bluster, a negotiating tactic meant to spur concessions from other countries. That changed on April 2, the day Trump declared \"Liberation Day\" and when he revealed steep tariffs that sent financial markets into a tailspin. Treasurys Markets still haven't recovered -- even after the president rolled back and delayed many of his tariff plans. Typically, bond prices rise when stocks fall, offering a hedge for investors during stock market turmoil. But that hasn't been the case in recent weeks. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasurys, a key benchmark for borrowing costs, have increased 0.16 percentage point in April. Bond yields rise as prices fall, meaning investors are selling U.S. government bonds -- widely considered one of the safest and most dependable assets -- even when stocks are falling. The dollar "}
{"title": "", "date": "", "source": "", "content": "Concerns about the economy, along with fears about Trump's growing feud with the Fed, are weighing on the U.S. dollar. The ICE U.S. dollar index, a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, slipped more than 1% on Monday to its lowest level in three years. With other defensive plays falling short, investors have piled into one of oldest hedges there is: gold. Future prices for the precious metal reached another all-time high on Monday. Gold futures gained over 2% from Thursday's settling price to breach $3,400 for the first time. Gold futures have climbed almost 30% since the start of the year. The markets' \"fear gauge\" remains elevated, with worries about the trade war and the broader economy adding up to expectations for more volatility ahead. Sentiment The mood on Wall Street is darkening as a result. Bearishness levels -- or expectations that stock prices will fall -- among ordinary investors have hovered above 50% for eight consecutive weeks, according to a weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors. That is the longest-lasting bear majority on record, the investor group said, based on data going back to 1987."}

It is that it will fail, and this is where Woody Hayes's warning looms large. If enough of the president's Hail Mary passes yield touchdowns, he'll be cheered as a genius. If he throws mostly incompletes, he will be vociferously booed. And if he throws so many interceptions that his opponents run away with the game, he will be universally scorned. Despite all the talk about realism and restraint, Mr. Trump has adopted the most ambitious foreign-policy agenda of any American president since Harry S. Truman. Reshaping the global trading system, reasserting American supremacy in the Western Hemisphere, restoring America's hard power, and blunting China's drive for hegemony in the Indo-Pacific are big goals. Mr. Trump's confidence in his passing arm is enduring. The whole world is about to discover whether that faith is well-placed."}

Solid first-quarter earnings from some of the country's largest financial firms, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock offered a tailwind even as their executives warned that Trump's trade restrictions put the economy at risk. JPMorgan shares rose 4%. BlackRock and Morgan Stanley gained 2.3% and 1.4%, respectively. Rising bond yields left investors newly worried about the country's federal budget deficit, its dependence on foreign funding, and its growing reliance on hedge funds, who have bought U.S. Treasurys with large amounts of debt. All of these challenges contributed to a selloff in Treasurys that only modestly slowed after Trump's announcement. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, a key reference for borrowing costs throughout the economy, posted its biggest one-week surge since November 2001 -- climbing half a percentage point to just under 4.5%. The yield on the 30-year bond had its sharpest weekly climb since April 1987, ending Friday at 4.873%. The sight of stock and bond prices falling sharply in unison unnerved many investors, raising fears of a potential breakdown in the normal functioning of Treasurys which are typically a haven in turbulent markets. As prices of Treasurys plunged so too did the value of the dollar, with traders favoring other currencies such as the euro. Foreign central banks hold dollars in part because they like investing in Treasurys, which are typically easier to buy and sell than the bonds issued by other governments. Many investors sought refuge instead in gold. Futures rose 2.1% to settle at a new all-time high of $3,222.20 a troy ounce, lifting mining stocks. Freeport-McMoRan added 6.4%. Newmont climbed 7.9% on Friday for a weekly gain of 24%. Prices for oil, copper and other commodities also increased Friday, though they have been as volatile as stocks lately. Benchmark U.S. oil futures added $1.43 a barrel Friday to settle at $61.50. That is down 0.8% on the week but 14% lower this month."}

For a delicious, creamy, midprice French butter, a good choice we didn't have room to include below is Isigny Sainte Mere, available in good supermarkets in most states; on the list you'll find mass-produced imports from Denmark, Ireland and Finland. For a European-style, higher-butterfat option at a reasonable price, try Plugra and Vermont Creamery, both American made. For an American artisan butter that's widely available, there's Ploughgate Creamery, but it's also worth seeking out local artisan butters in your city's cheese stores, gourmet markets and farmers' markets. Butter freezes well, wrapped in parchment or plastic, then sealed in freezer bags, for at least three months. In the fridge, keep butter covered so it doesn't absorb odors. Cultured butters keep well at room temperature, too, if covered and kept away from the heat of the stove and direct sunlight. For serving, a cool room temperature is best."}

{"title": "Congo's Neighbors Smuggle Out Its Riches as War Rages", "date": "8 April 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "World News: Congo's Neighbors Smuggle Out Its Riches as War Rages --- Country struggles to prevent Rwanda and Uganda from seizing gold, diamonds, coltan. By Nicholas Bariyo 847 words A8 English Copyright 2025 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. KAMPALA, Uganda -- During the 19th century's Scramble for Africa, European countries raced to secure territory and wealth across the continent. Now, African powers are grabbing resources from a neighbor crippled by infighting and ill-equipped to defend itself. Caught in the middle is the Democratic Republic of Congo, a country the size of Western Europe whose forests conceal a wealth of gold, diamonds and coltan, a key component in smartphones and computers. These mineral riches are turning what was a region plagued by militia violence into a battleground, as Rwanda and its local allies seize coltan supplies while Uganda and its proxies move to take over gold mines to the northeast, say United Nations and Ugandan officials. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President Paul Kagame are pouring troops and weapons into Congo, while their Congolese allies, who control strategic border crossings, secure smuggling routes to move more minerals to the global markets, the officials say. The influx began three years ago, when Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi invited Ugandan troops into Congo to fight an Islamic State-aligned rebel group based in woodlands straddling the border between the two countries. Uganda's military is considered among the most competent in Africa and, at the time, Tshisekedi thought Museveni's forces would help him achieve the \"rapid and robust\" solution to the region's long-running insurgencies he promised when he assumed office in 2019. Instead, the deployment prompted Rwanda to launch its own 2022 incursion, using a once-sleepy Congolese rebel group known as M23 as deniable cover, and the situation quickly escalated. Uganda supplemented its 1,700-strong force in Congo with another 2,300 troops. Ugandan bulldozers constructed dirt roads to rebel hideouts, including mining areas. Ugandan instructors trained fighters loyal to a warlord controlling gold mines, where armed groups make as much as $140 million a year from illegal mining, U.N. investigators say. Last year, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized the coltan-mining town of Rubaya, where fighters bring in about $800,000 each month by taxing traders. Rebel fighters have doubled diggers' wages to encourage them to keep working, and they rely on forced labor to widen roads to accommodate trucks transporting coltan into Rwanda along with gold. According to the U.N., about 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are fighting inside Congo, a report Rwandan authorities have denied. A Rwandan government spokeswoman has denied accusations that Rwanda steals Congolese minerals. The spokeswoman didn't respond to messages seeking further comment. A spokeswoman for Uganda's energy and minerals ministry said it has established new measures to stem the export of smuggled minerals. She said that while the ministry believes that most of the gold exported from Uganda is produced domestically, a lack of tighter checks along its porous, 545-mile-long border with Congo makes smuggling hard to control. The race to control Congo's minerals and smuggling routes, some analysts say, is propelled in part by surging demand. Gold prices rose above $3,000 a troy ounce in March, leaving the vast country and its beleaguered president in a difficult position to resist neighboring countries' growing interest. \"Tshisekedi turned to desperate measures to solve a desperate situation,\" said Richard Moncrieff, regional analyst with Brussels-based International Crisis Group. \"He is now struggling to respond to the humiliating turn of events.\""}

A White House official said it doesn't comment on the president's private correspondence.\nRwanda doesn't have significant domestic production of coltan, but still earned $1.1 billion in 2023 from\nminerals commonly mined in eastern Congo, a 43% jump from the previous year, according to official data.\nLikewise, Uganda doesn't have a large domestic gold-mining industry, but its gold exports hit a record $3.4\nbillion last year, according to Ugandan central-bank data, and surpassed coffee as the country's top\nforeign-exchange earner.\nU.N. investigators and human-rights groups say minerals smuggled out of Congo account for the surge in\nboth Rwanda's and Uganda's overseas sales.\nIn January, M23 -- backed by 4,000 Rwandan troops, U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said --\nbatted aside Congolese and U.N. soldiers and swept into Goma, the largest city in eastern Congo.

{"title": "Ultra-Luxe Food Cravings Sustain Supplier", "date": "1 April 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "Consumers are nervous about the economy, cutting back on everything from necessities to luxury goods. But for one company selling the most premium ingredients -- Wagyu beef, edible gold-leaf garnishes and Italian white truffle oil, among other things -- to high-end restaurants, sales are moving along nicely. Chefs' Warehouse caters to more than 50,000 upscale restaurants, hotels and country clubs throughout the U.S., Canada and the Middle East, establishments that tend to feed the top 10% of the world's earners. The well-to-do clientele's spending power has so far insulated the specialty distributor from pressures hitting others in the food space. The company's revenue last year grew 7.5% when stripping out acquisitions, and volumes were up mid-single digits compared with a year earlier, while overall U.S. restaurant traffic was down in 2024, according to Chefs' Warehouse Finance Chief Jim Leddy. Chefs' Warehouse shares are up over 40% from a year ago, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite trailed, rising around 6%. \"We're in a good place,\" Leddy said. \"And we're going to continue to grow, and expect to grow faster really than the rest of the industry, given our niche.\" As more Americans pinch pennies -- worried about stubborn inflation, extensive new tariffs and renewed talk of recession -- the well-off continue to splurge on food. The top 10% of earners in the U.S., or households making roughly $250,000 a year or more, account for nearly half of all spending, and while the high-end consumer may complain about desserts costing more, for instance, with egg and chocolate prices soaring, they still want a quality meal and will pay for it, according to Leddy. Consumer anxiety stretches across income levels: Denny's and McDonald's diners are cutting back, as are shoppers in high-end department stores. Executives are working to keep prices down, and Chefs' Warehouse is no different. The company does what it can to limit price hikes, for one thing, by tapping into its more than 4,000 suppliers, said Leddy. \"We bring in 150 different types of olive oil from around the world,\" he said. \"So if there's a drought in Spain and prices double on olive oil from there, we source from Turkey or Italy.\" Higher price tags are sometimes inevitable, though. Egg prices have skyrocketed due to bird flu, for instance. That means Chefs' Warehouse has recently paid as much as roughly 20% more for a case of 20 dozen eggs than a year ago. Tariffs may lift overall prices further still, but because Chefs' Warehouse imports only around 15% of its goods, analysts don't expect a significant impact. The company passes any of its own higher costs on to its customers, which may then show up in food and drink prices. Higher-end chefs and their customers will pay the elevated cost, said Andrew Wolf, a senior consumer analyst at broker dealer C.L. King. \"If you use whole tomatoes from Italy, these chefs, once they get something in their recipe that works, they aren't likely to change,\" he said. \"You're not going to screw with your tomato sauce.\" Analysts are watching for indications that the wealthiest of eaters are cutting back on fine dining. So far, the signals aren't there. Top-tier consumers may dial back spending if the economy slips into a deep recession, but high-end dining isn't where they are likely to make initial cuts, analysts said. \"A high-end dinner is not cheap,\" said Wolf. \"But it's not like buying a Gucci bag.\" While working to keep its current roster of customers happy with high-end steaks, oils, cheese and seafood, Chefs' Warehouse also is expanding its reach.

All rights reserved.\n\nStreetwise: Prepare a Portfolio for the Next Market Mess\n\nBy James Mackintosh\n\n1,042 words\n\nWhat happens if it all goes wrong? Investments designed to preserve your wealth in a market downturn can\nhelp preserve your sanity, allowing you to avoid dumping favorite stocks as prices tumble.\n\nBut finding this market insurance has become harder, with Treasurys and perhaps even the dollar no longer\noffering the protection they used to. No wonder gold is up so much.\nThe basic problem: Much of the insurance provided by any investment depends on how other people react. A\nsecondary issue that's particularly important for Treasurys is the new era of inflation sensitivity.\nThe selloff since the S&P 500 peaked in mid-February is illustrative of what's meant to happen, and what's\nnot. Treasurys did what they are supposed to do, and profited as stocks fell. The dollar didn't, falling with\nstocks. Gold did both.\nOf course, a few weeks' returns are mostly meaningless. I'll look at how the protection offered by Treasurys\nshifted in recent years, before discussing the dollar and gold.\nTreasurys used to be the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too investment, providing what amounted to free\ninsurance against stock-price falls from the late 1990s onward. When times were good, bond yields declined,\nsome prices rose. When times were bad, the Federal Reserve cut rates, so bond prices rose even more. In\nmarket panics, traders piled into Treasurys, so bond prices rose. The icing on the cake was that over short\nperiods bond yields tended to rise and fall with stock prices, so Treasurys helped make a stock portfolio less\nvolatile without giving up much in the way of return.\nThe move from a time when investors could ignore inflation to one where inflation is a constant pressure\nhas changed how Treasurys and stocks behave. Bond yields no longer reliably rise and fall with stock prices,\nbecause inflation fears can push yields up and stocks down at the same time. As they learned in 2022,\ninvestors can lose on their Treasurys even when stocks are falling.\nTreasury yields don't reliably move in the opposite way to stocks, as they did from the 1970s to the late\n1990s. But they can no longer be relied on to provide a sweet treat when stocks drop.\nThis isn't to say Treasurys are useless. They once again offer a reasonable yield, 4.3% on the 10-year, and\nought to do well in a panic, at least short of a 2020-style liquidation.\nIt's just that they can no longer be expected to provide either the long-term returns or the free short-term\nportfolio protection that once made them so tasty.\nThe dollar has a different problem, but the root cause is the same: It's just too popular.\nAmericans don't tend to think of the dollar as an investment option, since it is just their currency. But it is\nmerely the default -- and may no longer be the right choice.\nFor a long time the greenback has provided a remarkable form of insurance dubbed the \"dollar smile\" by\nStephen Jen, now chief executive of Eurizon SLJ Capital. In good times for the U.S. economy, it strengthens\nas money flows in search of profits. In bad times for the U.S. economy it strengthens too, as money flows in\nsearch of America's safe assets.\nThe first part has worked very well recently, but perhaps too well. Money has flooded in to such an extent that\nthe dollar in January was the strongest against major trading partners, adjusted for inflation, since the 1985\nPlaza Accord to weaken the currency. Foreign investors chose the U.S. because its economy was red hot\nand its market the home of the exciting big tech companies and artificial-intelligence stocks."}

All rights reserved.\n\nWill still more money arrive if there's a downturn? The danger is that the \"American exceptionalism\" trade\became so widespread -- even before President Trump's November victory gave it a final boost -- that if the\nU.S. hits trouble money will leave, rather than seek safety.\n\nNormally when investors panic they repatriate much of the money they hold in stocks, offset by money going\ninto the safety of Treasurys.\n\nNow there's a lot more foreign money in U.S. stocks, and less U.S. money abroad to pull back.\n\nMatt Smith, a fund manager at Ruffer, says: \"Foreign money has poured in and allowed U.S. money to pour\nout into consumer spending and government borrowing.\"\nThe talk from some in Trump's team of using a putative \"Mar-a-Lago Accord\" to punish foreigners who hold\ndollars could deter some who would usually seek out dollars, too.\n\nGold has already been a big beneficiary. The price is up 50% in just over a year as investors bet on more\nbuying by foreign central banks concerned about parking their money in dollars.\n\nThis might be a problem. Unlike Treasurys and the dollar, gold ought to do well in a new era of inflationary\npressure. But like Treasurys and the dollar, a lot of money has already poured in. How will it fare in a panic?\n\nGold gained a similar amount in the 12 months to March 2008, as fears of financial troubles rose.\n\nBut when first Bear Stearns and then Lehman Brothers failed, gold prices crashed from above $1,000 an\nounce to just over $700, as investors sold to pay off debt.\n\nCash is the safest of safe assets in the short run, and at the moment has a decent yield -- but doesn't go up in\nvalue when times are bad, so is more about timing the market than long-run investing.\n\nWhen choosing a safe asset, it's just as important to know who else owns it as to think about its fundamental\nproperties.\n\nIf they all sell in a panic, you're stuck with something worth a lot less if you need to sell in a hurry.\n\nI still like Treasurys, and would have more cash than usual, but all the options are much less attractive than\nthey used to be."}

All Rights Reserved. Andrew Gerrior recently took his money out of crypto and bought 16.5 ounces worth of gold bars. The 38-year-old radio and television consultant was skeptical about whether crypto or the stock market would gain under President Trump. Plus, the thought of a physical investment comforted him. \"What I decide to do with that in the future, whether I sell it back into the market or keep it for children in the future, I don't know,\" said Gerrior, who lives in Ontario and keeps the bars in a safe at a bank. \"But I have something -- and I think that's kind of cool.\" The metal is attracting first-time buyers seeking a stable investment as Trump's policies rattle the stock market and escalate global political tensions. Other longtime devotees are increasing their holdings. Front-month gold futures settled at a record $3,086.50 a troy ounce on Friday after a key inflation gauge rose. They have climbed 17% this year, while the S&P 500 has lost 5.1%. Investors have poured a net $11.4 billion into physical gold ETFs since the start of February, according to Morningstar. The funds are on pace to net the most monthly inflows in March since July 2020, during the height of the pandemic. Gold enthusiasts have long been seen as skewing older and more politically conservative, with many owning the metal as a hedge against inflation, war or catastrophes. Some financial advisers discourage investing in it because it doesn't pay dividends or generate returns and it has gone long stretches without rising significantly in value. Now, gold sellers say they are seeing interest from a wider range of investors. When David Zanca started managing gold portfolios more than 30 years ago, his clients tended to be around 65 to 70. Today, he said he is seeing clients as young as 35. \"Owning physical gold is moving more toward the mainstream,\" said Zanca, senior portfolio manager at Blanchard & Co., a rare coin and precious metals firm in New Orleans. Other times when Zanca noticed gold gaining followers were during the dot-com bubble, when the 2008 financial crisis hit and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Costco started offering gold bars in 2023, and the retailer's website and stores sold out within hours. Other investors are flocking to gold after seeing its price climb, said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors. When gold prices hit a record on March 20, physical gold ETFs netted more than $2 billion, according to Morningstar. There are two main ways to invest in gold: People can buy physical gold bars or coins, or put money into gold-related investments such as funds, futures and stocks. A year ago, Shane Scott said he would have thrown his extra cash into the stock market. Now, he is considering investing in a gold fund. The 32-year-old legal assistant recently moved back in with his mother so he could rent out his house, and says he might use the extra cash to invest in the metal. The volatility of U.S. stocks has made Scott nervous, while he sees gold as a more stable hedge against inflation. \"I've always heard gold is good in times of dire need,\" Scott said. Mark Dunbar is among gold's longtime enthusiasts. The 62-year-old Vermont resident has had physical gold since 2015, and says his stockpile is now worth about $20,000."}

After the 2008 financial crisis, Dunbar said, he had to give up his dairy farm and pick up his job as a public-school facilities director. His gold ETF is doing better than his other investments. A rush into gold by investors is common during times of market turbulence, said Rebecca Palmer, head of financial guidance at Fruitful, a financial services company. She said many of her clients, who range in age from 25 to 45, are experiencing a market downturn for the first time and asking about it. \"Any time there is market uncertainty, there's suddenly a new product to sell to people,\" she said. \"Whether that's gold or it's crypto or a niche ETF.\" Palmer advises her clients not to add it into their portfolios, because it doesn't produce income and can be volatile. For short-term savings, she recommends high-yield savings accounts. For those with a long-term investment strategy, she said the best move can be to avoid looking at accounts daily during periods of market volatility. \"Gold, more than anything right now, is a distraction,\" she said. Some believe gold still has a way to go: Bank of America analysts this past week raised their price target to $3,500, assuming that Trump-driven anxieties continue to drive everyday investors to the precious metal."}

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 700 points, or 1.7%, its largest percentage drop since March 10. The worrisome signs included inflation picking up, as tracked by the Fed's preferred measure. That figure, excluding volatile food and energy prices, came in at 0.4% for February, or 2.8% compared with a year earlier. Both rates were slightly ahead of forecasts. Consumer sentiment also worsened, which investors fear could slow spending. The University of Michigan's survey showed a drop in the headline index to 57, the lowest level since 2022. The somber mood was reflected in the stock market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2.7%, with the Magnificent Seven group of stocks erasing about $505 billion in market value. The S&P 500 tumbled nearly 2%, with 10 out of the 11 sectors finishing in the red. Some investors view next week -- when the U.S. is expected to further detail major reciprocal tariffs and implement auto tariffs announced by Trump -- as a potential turning point for the direction of markets.

Some worry that keeping all of their eggs in an\nAmerican basket might no longer be the way to go.\n\nAnd investors are finding bargains nearly everywhere else.

But there are hefty tax implications for moving capital across the Atlantic, so he is\nholding on to his American stocks.\n\nThere might be smart bets to make overseas, but finding those stocks takes time and skill, said Thomas\nCooper, a 34-year-old Ohio-based entrepreneur who trades daily. While Cooper has bought more gold to\nprotect himself from the ups and downs of the Trump-era stock market, he has been intimidated by the\nprospect of looking abroad, because of the time constraints of his job.\n\n\"I don't have an edge in the Europe markets and the China market and all the emerging markets in the world\nto feel confident trading with the amount of money that I trade with,\" Cooper said.\n\nStill, the thought is enticing. \"I don't blame anybody,\" Cooper said. \"I see the all-time highs overseas.\"\n\nAnd for a swath of investors, American stocks are just too good to lose. Watching from Queensland,\nAustralia, Andrew Barnett has grown concerned with what the latest policies out of Washington will mean for\neconomic growth. He has moved over half of his portfolio into non-American stocks, such as LVMH and\nAlibaba.\n\nBut he also thinks the U.S. houses the world's top talent and its most-successful companies -- and he hasn't\ngiven up on American exceptionalism.\n\n\"You've got 27 countries in the EU,\" he said. \"You've got 27 different cultures and languages and retirement\nages.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.9%, or 383 points. Investors had been expecting the Fed to keep rates unchanged, and to pencil in one or two cuts for 2025.

They apply to all alternative assets held by the Treasury. Having a strategic reserve of gold and euros also invites presidents to bypass Congress on spending.\nThe crux of the argument against a crypto reserve is that \"gold has been used as a store of wealth for centuries,\" while \"bitcoin has been around for all of 16 years.\" For those who focus on the short-term movements of bitcoin, this argument is persuasive in a month when bitcoin is down more than 10% and crypto hucksters abound.\nThere will, however, inevitably be a digital version of gold for the simple reason that there has been a persistent demand throughout history for an asset that isn't subject to political monetary policy. Gold has served this function for millennia, but in our digital age the ability to hold and instantaneously transfer a fixed-supply, transnational asset can in some ways be better served by a digital asset. It's ironic that those who critique gold as a \"barbarous relic\" (John Maynard Keynes) are usually the first to critique bitcoin as newfangled \"rat poison\" (Warren Buffett).\nAny national asset reserve is susceptible to politicization, as President Biden powerfully demonstrated with his depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease gas prices in 2022. The architects of Mr. Trump's crypto reserve should design guardrails to prevent such politicization -- say, by establishing an objective standard for adding new assets to the reserve as well as a formula for buying and selling assets.\nIt's true we don't want presidents of both parties playing hedge-fund manager in chief. But selling bitcoin is as much an investment decision as buying them. Owning a small amount of bitcoin sends a message that the federal government is skeptical of a Federal Reserve that is all too willing to print and politicize the dollar.\nProf. Max Raskin\nNew York University"}

{"title": "Wary Investors Play Defense In Switch to Dividend Stocks", "date": "10 March 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "Rattled by the threat of trade restrictions and a slowing economy, some investors are turning to a classic defensive play: dividend stocks. Shares of companies that offer relatively hefty cash payouts are beating the broader market this year. Some of the market's largest dividend-focused funds, such as Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF and SPDR S&P Dividend ETF, have risen more than 4% in 2025, even as major indexes slipped into the red. Some of the largest dividend payers have posted significant gains. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats -- an index of companies that have raised dividends in each of the past 25 years -- has returned about 3.5% this year, counting price changes and dividend payments as of Thursday's market close. The index constituents Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson have both notched double-digit-percentage increases in 2025. Meanwhile, recent stock-market stars including Nvidia and Broadcom have sunk more than 15%. As President Trump's tariff threats helped drag the S&P 500 on Friday to its worst week since September, some money managers said such time-tested stocks, and their regular cash payments, could shine even brighter in the months ahead. \"There haven't been many risk-averse investors over the last couple of years,\" said Jared Hoff, a senior portfolio manager at Federated Hermes who manages several dividend-focused funds. \"There are a lot of different factors right now shifting attention back in our direction.\" Investors will get a look at the health of the economy this week, with fresh data on job openings and wholesale prices as well as a key inflation report on Wednesday. Dividend payers are just one of the safety plays gaining popularity. Investors have flocked to other havens such as gold and U.S. Treasurys, while fleeing stocks in smaller companies or the financial sector that could be sensitive to an economic slowdown. But many prefer dividend stocks to such alternatives, because holding stocks allows investors to capture the gains if share prices rise, while the regular dividend payments help cushion declines. Brian Bollinger is president and founder of Simply Safe Dividends, which sells an online tool to help customers track and manage their dividend-focused portfolios. The company -- which calls itself \"boring and conservative\" on its website -- hasn't seen sales grow this quickly at the start of the year since 2022, Bollinger said. \"More people are starting to think about safety,\" he said. \"Safety hasn't been sexy since 2022.\" The upswing contrasts with a couple of tough years for dividend payers. As interest rates rose, income-focused investors could get more-attractive yields from bonds. Market standouts such as the Magnificent Seven tech stocks soared, powered by optimism about the transformative nature of artificial intelligence. That left many mature, dividend-paying companies in the dust. But the tech-heavy bets that delivered blockbuster returns in last year's market have faltered so far in 2025. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has dropped 10% this year. John Bevis, a full-time trader based in Clemson, S.C., predicted this year that policy uncertainty might lead to market turmoil. He scaled back his position in big tech companies like Tesla and Nvidia in January and February, he said, and picked up shares of Coca-Cola and the household-products provider Procter & Gamble. \"With higher inflation, people aren't going to buy more Teslas,\" Bevis, 32 years old, said. \"With this uncertainty, you've got to stick to the solid companies that have been around for 100 years.\""}

Share prices can still post big swings when markets slide or a given company runs into problems.\nIn addition, the broader equity markets' rise to record territory before the recent downturn has made high dividend yields from major U.S. companies harder to find.\nThe S&P 500's dividend yield sat around 1.3% as of Thursday's market close, among the lowest levels in more than 20 years. Some of the largest companies in the market have lately become increasingly focused on using cash to spur growth, instead of distributing it to shareholders.\nBut many of the most well-known dividend stocks -- such as Walmart or the healthcare company Abbott Laboratories -- are mature, well-established companies in industries that money managers say are less susceptible to market swings.\nQuarterly dividends can offer a secure return in a market that is looking increasingly uncertain, said Jacob Kuehl, a supply-chain planning manager based in the Portland, Ore., area who thinks it is a good time to be an income-focused investor.\nThough dividend stocks already make up about half of his portfolio, Kuehl said he plans to keep buying up shares of Nike and Exxon Mobil, he said, as well as smaller stocks like Papa John's International and Blue Owl Capital.\n\"It seems to be a really frothy market -- really jittery,\" he said. \"What I'm banking on is that people are going to move to security.\""}

The consumer-staples sector has generally outperformed others, with Procter & Gamble -- the maker of essentials such as Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste -- rising 0.4% this week. Anxieties have extended well beyond Wall Street. Thomas Cooper, a 34-year-old in Wooster, Ohio, who runs service and advertising businesses and trades daily, said he has bought more gold since Trump's election to protect himself from volatility. \"The market is just turning against you very quickly, out of nowhere,\" he said. One bright spot for investors has been the rally in bonds, which had been battered in recent years by sticky inflation. As of Tuesday, the widely-tracked Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index had returned 2.7% this year, including price gains and interest payments. Some analysts, though, caution that further gains could be more challenging. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, making the central bank reluctant to cut rates much more than it already has. Expectations for lower rates tend to boost demand for existing bonds, as investors try to lock in higher yields while they still can. Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, is among those skeptical that bonds can keep rallying. Jacobsen said that he still believes that Trump will use tariffs mostly as a negotiating tool, but that the president clearly intends to drive a harder bargain than he had previously anticipated. \"I thought the negotiation would have taken place before the implementation,\" Jacobsen said. \"Apparently, he would rather do: implement first, negotiate later.\""}
{"title": "", "date": "", "source": "", "content": "Page 84 of 220 , Tether has repeatedly denied aiding criminal actors and has said it cooperates with law-enforcement agencies. Devasini, an Italian, charted a peripatetic career, first as a plastic surgeon in Milan, then as an electronics importer in Hong Kong. He later discovered the nascent crypto industry, and spotted an opportunity. Crypto companies couldn't connect their digital currencies with the real-world banking system. Launched in 2014 and registered in the British Virgin Islands, Tether aimed to fix this problem. Traders could exchange their real-world currencies for tether at a value pegged to the dollar, and exchange the stablecoin for other tokens near instantaneously via digital blockchains. In Devasini's eyes, tether was meant to subvert traditional finance. His wife, an artist, exhibited paintings of dollar bills with the image of George Washington screaming because, she said, they had \"no more value.\" Allaire's mission was different. The American, now 53, was an established Silicon Valley entrepreneur who had served as chief technology officer at software firm Macromedia, which pioneered Flash animation. With Circle, which he set up in Boston the year before Tether's debut, Allaire wanted to create a new financial system that would update an inefficient patchwork of banking networks that often snarled international payments. While most of the crypto community relished the unregulated marketplace, Allaire's strategy to grow Circle by working with regulators was ironically \"the contrarian bet,\" said Hemant Taneja, CEO of venture-capital firm General Catalyst, where Allaire had also worked. Taneja and other big-name U.S. investors, including fellow venture capitalist Jim Breyer, known for his early stake in Facebook, lined up to fund Allaire's vision. Goldman Sachs, asset-managers BlackRock and Fidelity, as well as crypto exchange Coinbase, all later invested, too. Allaire remains Circle's largest individual shareholder. Allaire first testified before Congress in late 2013 and called for the U.S. to take the lead in putting guardrails on crypto to avoid allowing criminals to seize the advantage. \"He is as good as anyone I know at sitting down with very senior Washington politicians,\" Breyer said. The mudslinging between Circle and Tether started when crypto trading hit the mainstream in 2020. Tether's \"greatest feature is its non-compliance and opacity,\" Allaire tweeted in January that year, noting it had become a solution for those wanting to bypass the financial system. In letters to authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere, Circle raised the alarm about how unregulated stablecoins could harm consumers. Circle that July flagged to the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors global finance, an incident that happened two years earlier in which tether temporarily lost its dollar peg because authorities seized a chunk of its reserves as part of a money-laundering investigation. Circle promoted its transparency and released audited financials in 2021. It later hired accounting firm Deloitte to sign off on comprehensive monthly statements covering USDC's reserves, which consist mostly of Treasurys, plus some short-term Treasury loans and cash. Tether, in contrast, releases financial statements that are far lighter in detail, and only after being forced by New York state regulators. Tether also supplements its Treasurys with bitcoin, commercial loans, gold and unspecified other investments. Devasini griped to associates in messages reviewed by the Journal about unfair comparisons with Circle. He branded USDC a \"shitcoin\" and said auditors wouldn't work with Tether due to its reputation, claiming others were spreading lies about his company online. After years of mediocre returns, Tether and Circle stumbled into a gusher of money in 2022. When the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, Tether's Treasury holdings went from earning tens of millions of dollars a year to hundreds of millions a quarter. At a meeting in the Bahamas that December, Devasini told a business partner he believed Tether posed such a threat to the U.S.-dominated international banking order that the White House could seek to shut it down at any moment. Allaire, meanwhile, was deepening his ties to the traditional financial world. By the end of 2022, Circle kept most of its reserves at Bank of New York Mellon, the world's largest custody bank, as well as some cash at other regulated financial institutions. BlackRock managed its Treasury portfolio. Allaire tweeted \"Flight to quality\" about traders ditching tether for USDC as his stablecoin gained ground on its rival."}

Her family had wolfed down 16 sides of Loaded Garlic Mashed Potatoes, five cheeseburgers and five orders of Brew Pub Pretzels & Beer Cheese Dip during their visits to Applebee's restaurants in December and January. And it wasn't enough. Nearly a year ago, the Fargo, N.D., family snagged one of the chain's Date Night Pass subscriptions, offering 52 discounted meals at the casual dining chain for a total savings of more than $1,500. Applebee's pitched the gold-colored passes as tickets to regular romance at a reasonable price -- and consumers snapped up the entire supply of the original run in less than a minute. For the Brookses, the pass became a ticket to a marathon that has taken them to Applebee's locations in three states. They learned how to hack the menu to keep things interesting. The family treated visiting relatives to Applebee's entrees. And when Emily's husband Bill went on a diet, they found ways to eat healthy as servers toted plates of nachos and Whole Lotta Bacon Burgers past their table week after week. Despite their fervor, the Brookses fell way behind. In December, they started mapping out meals on the calendar to wring every last boneless wing and Fiesta Lime Chicken from the pass before it expired on Jan. 31. They averaged two to three trips to Applebee's a week for much of December and January. With about a week left before the pass expired, they had five meals to go. \"We really want to use them all,\" said Brooks, 44, an artist who helps run the family's pinball machine business. Applebee's unveiled the Date Night Passes in January last year, among a wave of deals and promotions launched by restaurants to keep customers coming in after inflation-driven menu price increases. Brooks set an alarm to enter the online lottery that Applebee's conducted to award the passes, and was pumped to be one of the lucky winners. The depth of the challenge soon set in. The Brookses initially headed to their local Applebee's in Fargo, placing their typical comfort-food orders: Bourbon Street Mushroom Swiss Burgers, Pub Pretzels, the Riblets Plate. They went for an early Valentine's Day dinner and occasionally brought along their daughter and son. After munching through all three Fargo area locations, they branched out. While on vacation in New York, they hit the Applebee's in Times Square. They treated their son to Applebee's in Grand Forks, N.D., when visiting him at college. And when their daughter had a school government meeting at the state capitol in Bismarck, they checked out the Applebee's there. Seeking more Applebee's-ready occasions, Brooks took her 14-year-old daughter after school to make homework go down easier over appetizers, Bill joining them after work. Brooks's daughter, a picky eater, started adding in chicken pasta dishes and broccoli with her usual orders of brew pub pretzels. The Brookses also looked for opportunities to foist Applebee's on friends and family. When friends visited from Winnipeg, Canada, Applebee's it was: A takeout smorgasbord of wings and pasta. Brooks brought Applebee's fare to her new book group and treated extended family to boneless wings during a belated holiday visit in the Minneapolis area."}

{"title": "Demand for Safe Assets Drives Gold to High", "date": "31 January 2025", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "Gold futures set a fresh record on safe-haven demand, a weaker U.S. dollar and lower Treasury yields. The April gold contract, the most-active futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settled up 2.7% at $2,845.20 a troy ounce, after hitting a record intraday high of $2,853.20 earlier in the day. The prior record of $2,800.80 was set in late October. Gold prices have been volatile in recent days, with a sharp selloff on Monday seeing them shed 1.4%, as traders covered margins in a global rout of technology stocks. Prices gradually regained ground in the following days, before a similarly sharp jump on Thursday. The latest rally in gold prices likely reflects a combination of rising uncertainty about U.S. policies and a weaker dollar following the disappointing fourth quarter GDP report, Sprott Managing Partner Ryan McIntyre said in emailed commentary. Recent U.S. economic indicators along with the latest data showed softer-than-expected growth in the final quarter of 2024. This economic deceleration has contributed to a weakening of the dollar, which is providing support for gold, Sonora Wealth Group investment adviser Miro Svoboda wrote. Weakening in the greenback makes it cheaper for international purchasers to buy dollar-denominated assets like gold and improves the appeal of its safe-haven aspects. The slide in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields followed Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, which saw the central bank hold interest rates steady. Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed caution in Wednesday's meeting over further interest rate cuts, but noted that 'interest rates are meaningfully above neutral,' SP Angel analysts said in a note. The Fed's communication emphasized inflation concerns and acknowledged robust economic growth as well as strong labor market conditions, raising hopes for easing monetary policy, Svoboda said. Markets are now pricing in around two U.S. interest-rate cuts this year, a boon for non-interest bearing bullion. The Bank of Canada cut rates on Wednesday and as did the European Central Bank on Thursday, further supporting the metal's appeal. Gold has recorded a strong start to the year climbing 7.8% this month, and is set to rise much further in the short term now that President Donald Trump has taken office, MUFG analysts write. Trump's administration will drive safe-haven demand and play into the fear-related dimension of MUFG's bullish expectations for gold in 2025, the analysts said in a note. Commodities act as a critical inflation hedge, and MUFG expects a number of Trump-policy-induced inflation shocks. Among the policies mentioned by analysts as a risk to markets and global economic stability are Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that are set to take effect on Saturday, the analysts said. Threatened tariffs on China, Europe and commodities like copper, aluminum, iron and steel are a risk as well. 'We anticipate that gold will continue to perform well in 2025 due to the many uncertainties in the world and the ongoing desire for a store of value independent of other assets and institutions,' Sprott's McIntyre said. Market participants have also moved to borrow gold from central banks with London-based storage facilities. This demand surge was triggered by increased gold deliveries to the U.S., prompted by the potential import tariff speculation, resulting in significant London market bullion shortages, Sonora's Svoboda said."}

Worried about a potential surge in inflation, as the government spent money to\nkeep the economy afloat, Saylor studied bitcoin anew. He became a believer. Soon, Saylor was pitching his\nboard on the idea of using the cash to buy bitcoin. They agreed, mostly because there didn't seem to be any\nbetter alternatives for the company. At the least, the bet would draw some useful attention, they figured.\nThe year, Saylor spent half the company's money, about $250 million, to buy bitcoin at a price of around\n$11,000. Saylor put over $100 million of his own money in it, too. Right away, bitcoin's price tumbled to\n$9,000, costing MicroStrategy about $40 million.\n'Most of us on the board said \"Oh my gosh, what have we done, we're all gonna be sued\",\nRickertsen says.\n\"Mike was worried too.\" \nThe panic didn't last long. Bitcoin began climbing, finishing 2020 above $26,000. MicroStrategy borrowed a\nfew billion dollars to purchase even more bitcoin.\nThen came the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in late 2022. Bitcoin tumbled below $17,000 and\nMicroStrategy shares fell to about $17. Saylor and the company doubled down. They took advantage of\ndifficulties at its lender, Silvergate Bank, which was also hurting due to crypto, to pay $161 million to buy back\ntheir $205 million loan.\nThe stock began to soar as Saylor ramped up his strategy of selling shares and debt to buy bitcoin -- and as\nbitcoin climbed. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy raised $23.2 billion from stock and bond sales, one of the\nlargest hauls by a company in a single year, according to Mark Palmer, an analyst at the Benchmark\nCompany, an investment bank.\nSaylor's pitch can be repetitive and simplistic, and he sometimes speaks in a halting manner. But he's always\nevangelical in his belief in bitcoin. He stresses that it has limited supply, unlike the dollar or even gold. That\nhelps bitcoin do a better job protecting against inflation, Saylor argues.\nSome mutual funds and others have internal guidelines for how much of their money to invest in cryptocurrency,\nand many have been skeptical about investing in bitcoin at its current price. \nSaylor has proved adept at creating different kinds of equity and debt investments -- rolling out bank loans,\nconvertible bonds, common shares and more -- to keep the cash faucet flowing.\n\"His genius is he's creating different products for different audiences,\" says Brett Messing, an executive of\nSkyBridge Capital, which manages funds with substantial exposure to bitcoin and advises a fund that holds\nMicroStrategy shares.\nOver the past month or so, Saylor has promoted MicroStrategy and bitcoin on television shows and\nhigh-profile podcasts, at industry conferences and elsewhere. \"If you are not buying bitcoin at the top, you are\nleaving money on the table,\" he recently tweeted."}

All rights reserved.\nwe faced a unique challenge in Soviet communism, which he characterized as \"global in scope, atheistic in\ncharacter, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method.\" He implied we'd face that problem a long time.\nNow he gave the first of three warnings.\nTo meet the pressures of the moment, we need \"not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis\"\nbut the ability to move forward \"steadily, surely, and without complaint.\" For Americans, \"there is a recurring\ntemptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current\n_difficulties.\" But no, what we have to do is \"maintain balance\" between conflicting needs and power centers.\nNo matter the pressure, don't go off half-cocked.\nHe was warning against a kind of emotionalism in setting public policy. And it was a right warning: in the\nyears since we have become more emotional in our politics, and not necessarily more effective or\nconstructive.\nHis second warning had to do with the military. It is crucial to keeping peace. \"Our arms must be mighty\" lest\naggressors be tempted. But something important in the military sphere has changed. Before World War II,\n\"the United States had no armaments industry.\" When war came, the producers of plowshares learned to\nmake swords. But in the nuclear age, we can no longer risk \"emergency improvisation\": \"We have been\ncompelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.\" It worried him. \"This conjunction of\nan immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience,\" and we\nhave to keep our eye on the implications. \"We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,\nwhether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\" Only an alert citizenry \"can compel the\nproper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and\ngoals.\" We need security, but we can't sacrifice liberty to get it.\nEisenhower's third warning had to do with what he recognized as America's technological advance. It was\ngoing forward every day, and with it came the rise of scientific research. The federal government was\nincreasing its role in that area, directing and funding research. He was gravely concerned that with \"task\nforces of scientists in laboratories\" and universities receiving government contracts, there would be a\n\"domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money.\" \n\"Public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.\" \nHe shared that still-pertinent caution 64 years ago.\nThen the 70-year-old man who'd won the war and built the highways on which America sailed thanked the\npublic for the opportunities they had given him \"for public service.\" \nWhat a speech.\nMr. Biden, be useful. You've been observing America up close, as a political figure, for more than half a\ncentury. Any wisdom you can give, any unknown problem you can highlight? What trouble is coming that we\naren't seeing?\nDon't brag and insist on your place. Say something deep and true that we need to hear. It will be good for the\ncountry."}

Once again, MicroStrategy pops up: The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF and the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF aim to amplify the returns of the stock but have barely done so, often missing even their daily targets.\nThe next frontier is building ETFs that replicate other assets without some of their undesirable characteristics. The Alpha Architect 1-3 Month Box ETF, or BOXX, for example, tries to match or surpass T-bill returns with options so as not to trigger taxable distributions. Still, it was forced to do one last year under counsel from its legal advisers.\r\nThere also is demand to access so-called alternative assets in a cheaper, easier way. The University of Connecticut's endowment recently replaced most of its hedge-fund holdings with \"buffered ETFs,\" which also offer some protection in down markets. Products such as the IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Tracker ETF explicitly try to copy the performance of hedge funds without owning any.\r\nIn December, both BondBloxx and Virtus Investment Partners launched the first ETFs providing exposure to private debt, although in the form of relatively mainstream collateralized loan obligations. State Street Global Advisors has filed an application with U.S. regulators to launch an ETF that would invest a portion of its money in this illiquid form of credit directly. Its approval is uncertain because putting a liquid wrapper around less-liquid assets comes with obvious dangers.\r\nOf course, past innovation in ETFs has led to predictions of trouble that have time and again proved unfounded. In 2020, when corporate-debt markets froze, ETFs became a way to keep markets liquid during trying times.\r\nYet by their very nature, financial markets will eventually push one too many complex features into ETFs. Perhaps it will happen to this recent crop of products, leaving holders with a mix of losses in cash-like funds, stranded private assets and ill-conceived tax strategies that prompt angry calls from the Internal Revenue Service. The tipping point could still be years away.\r\nRegardless, investors need to be increasingly cautious about what they buy and who they buy it from. These are the times that will test ETF builders."}

Wall Street's gold bugs think prices will climb even higher in 2025.\n\nPrices for the precious metal rose more than 27%, or $566.80, to end 2024 at $2,629.20 a troy ounce. That is\nbetter than the S&P 500's 23% climb and not far behind the 29% increase of the technology-stock-laden\nNasdaq Composite Index.\n\nGold futures hit a record ahead of the U.S. presidential election but have declined since then. That was\nexpected, though, as investors who had been nervous about the election's outcome moved money from the\nhaven and back into riskier assets.\n\nAnalysts at JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup share a price target of $3,000. Here are some of their\nreasons:\n\nLower interest rates\n\nThe extent to which the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates remains to be determined, but investors expect\nfurther reductions in 2025. The lower rates get, the lower the opportunity cost of owning gold, which pays no\ninterest or dividends.\n\nAnalysts expect some portion of the $6.7 trillion held in money-market funds to find its way into\nexchange-traded funds that hold gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares, as investors become disenchanted with\ndecreasing yields. \"This is the most bullish part of the cycle for gold,\" said Greg Shearer, head of base- and\nprecious-metals strategy at JPMorgan.\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty\n\nInvestors large and small tend to flock to gold in times of heightened conflict. And there is plenty of that\nheaded into 2025, from wars in the Middle East and Ukraine to President-elect Donald Trump's vows to\nescalate trade disputes with China and other countries. The prospect that inflation will flare up again also\nhas investors on edge.\n\nInvestors in China have been especially enthusiastic about buying gold lately, given the country's slumping\neconomy and stocks, as well as Trump's threats to levy tariffs on its exports to the U.S.\n\nCentral-bank buying\n\nCentral banks around the world, especially in countries that have strained relationships with the West, have\nbeen gobbling up gold. China, in particular, is a powerful source of demand, with official gold reserves more\nthan tripling since 2008, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nWestern sanctions on Russia after it started its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 prompted some central\nbanks to move away from dollar-based assets. Instead, they are keeping more of their reserves at hand and\nin an asset, gold, that is beyond the reach of foreigners.\nThe Russia sanctions, Goldman analysts said, \"marked a clear turning point, leading many emerging-market\ncentral banks to rethink what is risk-free.\"In a 2024 poll of central bankers, 29% said they intended to increase their gold reserves in the subsequent\n12 months, according to the World Gold Council, the most since it started the survey in 2018.\nLittle industrial demand"}

In five of the past six years that gold futures have risen by at least 20%, prices rose again the following year. And in those five years, the average increase was more than 15%, according to Citi analysts.\n\nThe only year in which gold followed a 20% or better gain with a down year was in 2021, when prices fell 3.6% after gaining about 25% in 2020."}

All Rights Reserved. It's been some 40 years since Southern Methodist University was in the national title hunt at the business end of the college football season. From 1980 to 1984, the Mustangs posted a 49-9-1 record that ranked as the best in Division I. Boasting a bunch of blue-chip recruits headlined by Eric Dickerson, SMU earned three Southwest Conference titles and claimed a share of two national championships. You probably know what happened next. The program was busted for illegally paying its players. And in 1987, the NCAA made SMU into the pariah of college football, handing out the harshest punishment in the book -- the death penalty. Just like that, SMU football went from nearly winning national championships to not existing overnight. Yet this weekend, 37 years after being left for dead, 11-seeded SMU is back in the spotlight with a first-round date against No. 6 Penn State in the College Football Playoff. \"Holy crap, it took us 40 years,\" said Bill Armstrong, a major athletics donor and SMU trustee. \"It's been absolutely a long tortuous journey through the fricking desert.\" Oddly enough, the story of how SMU got here isn't all that different from how they landed in hot water in the first place. Boosters fed up with losing opened their checkbooks and shelled out tens of millions of dollars to upgrade the football team and secure a spot in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The primary difference, of course, is that in 2024 paying players is completely legal, thanks to rules that allow athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness. \"Our running joke was we were the first NIL,\" said Dickerson, who famously had a gold Trans Am \\\"appear\\\" in his driveway -- courtesy of a Texas A&M booster -- while getting recruited. Nevermind that most teams in the Southwest Conference back then were breaking the rules, it was SMU that had its football team placed on a one-year hiatus, among other punishments, when the NCAA determined the Mustangs had broken the rules. \"It was devastating,\" said David Miller, chairman of the SMU Board of Trustees. \"It not only crushed the athletic program, it frankly brought the university to its knees.\" It took a long while for the football team to get back to its feet. From the reinstatement of the program in 1989 until 2005, SMU enjoyed just one winning season. It wasn't until 2019 that the Mustangs achieved a 10-win season. Making matters worse, this demise came at the same time that financial disparities between the premier conferences and everyone else grew wider than ever before. If SMU was ever going to recapture the glory of the early \\'80s, boosters felt they needed to abandon the American Athletic Conference for one of the sport's powerhouse leagues. \\\"It felt like we needed to pony up now,\" Armstrong said, \"or we might forever be relegated to obscurity.\" The year everything changed was 2021. First, the NCAA made it legal for college athletes to make money -- exactly what the Pony Express had gotten in trouble for. Then Texas and Oklahoma touched off a years-long scramble of conference realignment by ditching the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference."}
{"title": "The Great Unblonding Is Here", "date": "21 December 2024", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "Mousy brown and dishwater blond have never been particularly trendy hair colors. But as bright-blond hair associated with screen sirens and news anchors has fallen out of fashion, those darker shades are rising in popularity. Referred to by fans as \"recession blond\" or \"old-money blond,\" the light-brownish hue is taking off. At a time when salon treatments regularly cost $400 and inflation is top of mind for Americans, hairstylists say more women are asking for hair color that is low-maintenance and natural-looking. Celebrities have helped popularize the shift. Taylor Swift, who has previously had gold waves and a platinum bob, has embraced a natural darker shade in her most recent era, as has musician Maggie Rogers. Paige Sander, a 29-year-old marketing manager in Utah, said her full head of cool-toned blond highlights required five-plus hours in a salon chair every four months and over $400 per visit. \"As I got older it became less of a decision and more of a routine,\" she said. Last year, she decided to grow it out. \"I am not a blonde anymore. I'm somewhere in the middle and I feel more confident than ever,\" she said. She posted about her experience on TikTok and got over 44,000 likes. \"This noncolor is subtle and ambiguous, sitting in a neutral space between colors,\" said Julie Dickson, master stylist and founder of Joon Drop Salon, adding that tones can vary from light, beige-y blond and pale, sunlit sand to deeper taupe and cool, gray-tinged hues. Emaly Baum, owner and colorist at Beauty Supply in New York, likens it to a child's hair color: \"Like when you were a kid and didn't have anything but soft highlights from the sun.\" Baum recently toned down the once-brighter shades of Rogers and actress Dianna Agron. Salon and spa-software company GlossGenius's annual report, which culls statistics from more than 80,000 beauty and wellness professionals and experts, found that \"lived-in color\" (which refers to partial, versus full, highlights or balayage, which is strategically freehand painted color) was the number one favorite hair color among stylists this year. Stylists said more clients are requesting a return to their natural color or something akin to it, which can be achieved using dye or gloss, which tones and adds shine to hair. Keeping bright, faux-blond fresh often requires significant time and money. \"Lighter blonds require tons of maintenance, and it's also intricate work with very little room for error, which requires a higher level of expertise,\" said Dickson. \"Not only does a slightly darker blond require less frequent salon visits, but it causes less damage, so it's shinier.\" It's quiet luxury as hair color, said Natalie Rotger, a colorist at Jenna Perry Hair Studio, and it's enough to sway people who have been blond for years. One of Rotger's recent clients, Holly Siegel, 42, a Long Island, N.Y.-based creative director, got a partial highlight to return to a more natural color. \"I'd been doing different levels of blond highlights for 10 years, but it was starting to feel too stripy or too brassy,\" Siegel said. \"Bright blond didn't feel very chic anymore to me.\" Andrea Brodfuehrer, a 43-year-old interior designer in Manhattan, found that blond hair no longer suited her as she entered middle age. \"The carefree blond of perceived effortlessness and vitality I was going for started to feel more like I was clutching at youth,\" Brodfuehrer said. Just don't call it dishwater."}

Bitcoin, bond prices, gold and oil futures fell, too. November's producer-price index rose 0.4% from October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. That was a little above analysts' expectations but not enough to shake investors' confidence that Federal Reserve officials will trim borrowing costs when they meet next week. It became a near certainty among traders that the Fed will follow central banks in Europe and Canada in another round of rate cuts after the consumer-price index was as expected Wednesday. Interest-rate futures data from CME Group show that traders think it is nearly a lock that the Fed will cut rates by 0.25 percentage point. Bond prices declined Thursday.

Part of the problem, said Ames, is that Chicago has never attracted the international buyers that have propped up condo markets in cities like New York and Miami. Moreover, she said, \"our market is not flashy. It's not like Beverly Hills.\" Agents and developers say condo sales have picked up in the last few months. Letchinger said he has sold 18 units at One Chicago in the last four months, for instance. \\\"I think we're starting to find the bottom,\" said Lowe. Just over a decade ago, Richard and Michaela Parrillo reportedly spent roughly $65 million building a lavish, European-inspired house in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. In August, the house sold for just $15.25 million. The Parrillo home wasn't for everyone. It had an entryway inlaid with marble from the French Pyrenees and a bronze and 22-karat-gold staircase. \\\"Somebody could gold plate their whole place, and it doesn't mean that someone's gonna pay for it,\" said Ames. The Parrillos couldn't be reached for comment. While the sale of the Parrillo residence was a unique situation, the sellers' woes weren't. There are fewer single-family homes than condos for sale on the Gold Coast, which has helped prop up their values. Still, houses that need work or have quirky features are languishing on the market, agents said. Real-estate agent Suzanne Gignilliat of @properties recently dropped the price on two of her Gold Coast listings. An 1800s townhouse is now asking $4.395 million, well below the $5.78 million the seller paid in 2011, and a row house from the same period is asking $3.995 million. The seller paid $3.95 million in 2005, records show. Bill Rudnick and Lisa Walker lost money recently when they sold their 19th-century row house on the Gold Coast after deciding to relocate to Florida, according to Rudnick, 60, an executive at a wealth- and asset-management firm. The couple listed the house for $2.19 million in 2021 and sold in August for just $1.65 million, the same amount they paid about 15 years prior, despite having poured six figures into renovating the property, Rudnick said. He attributed the loss to there being a \\\"taint\\\" to the area that was hard to overcome. Ultimately, however, he was sanguine about the loss. \\\"We loved the house and we enjoyed the money we put into it.\\\" There are bright spots in the market, particularly when it comes to move-in ready, new-construction houses, local agents said. A circa-2008 townhouse in Lincoln Park sold in October for $6.25 million, slightly under its original $6.9 million asking price, according to Zillow."}

All Rights Reserved. [Financial Analysis and Commentary] To go forward, Robinhood Markets says it must go backward. In its early days, a decade ago at this point, the online brokerage began making headway into the crowded business of stock and options trading partly by making it easy to do so via mobile devices. That helped it become a pathway into investing for many younger people. But at Robinhood's first-ever investor day on Wednesday, speaking now as a $35 billion market-cap company, the onetime upstart said it believes it must go back to the desktop computer as a pillar of its growth over the next few years. That is because the company is aiming to become the No. 1 platform for serious retail traders. About 50% of overall retail trading takes place away from mobile devices, the company said in its materials. But what is termed \"web\" trading has been less than 10% of Robinhood's volumes historically, the company said. Robinhood's recently launched Legend is \"what we believe to be the most state-of-the-art desktop platform for trading,\" Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said. It might be surprising to some that Robinhood is moving in this direction. After all, part of the allure of being a trading platform drawing many newbies is that you can evolve with those customers, as they move into needing retirement and other financial services. And Robinhood is certainly doing a lot of that wallet-share broadening, such as launching into individual retirement accounts and credit cards. But consider some of the larger tectonic shifts in the brokerage and wealth business. Major revenue sources are under big pressure. Higher interest rates are squeezing income from \"sweeping\" cash into low-cost deposit accounts, and there is also investor and regulatory scrutiny of this practice. Thanks largely to Robinhood, commissions on trading stocks are now typically zero. And getting big into consumer lending requires capital, taking on credit and interest-rate risk and competing with banks whose funding costs are superlow. So going deeper with serious traders makes sense. They are likely to pay to subscribe to Robinhood's Gold service, which offers many of its best products or features. They might borrow money to trade on margin. They can also trade at a frequency that still generates substantial revenue from payment for order flow. Robinhood says success with active traders can help fund and develop products that can later be introduced to a mass audience. It recently agreed to acquire TradePMR, a platform for advisers that can help it connect customers to a human. But Robinhood also believes many future investors might behave more like do-it-yourself day traders. \"Institutional distrust is at an all-time high,\" Tenev told investors. He argued that wealth is transferring \"from people who grew up needing stockbrokers and visits to bank branches to the type of people . . . who are growing up with the tools to independently manage their finances from home.\" Already, Robinhood has significant inroads with people who have more-sophisticated financial needs. According to investor day figures, 45% of recent users earn six figures or more. In addition to its Legend platform, Robinhood recently added futures trading and index options trading, as well as event contracts, on top of its prior move into 24-hour trading, all of which should appeal to the active-trader segment. Whether they are making moves on desktop or mobile, Robinhood is still betting that highly active traders are a core part of its business."}

Those days are over, at least for now.\nThe kingdom is struggling to execute its plan to keep prices elevated. Higher prices would help pay for Saudi's infrastructure-spending spree, including $1 trillion of projects designed to rapidly pivot the economy away from oil. It would also pinch drivers at the pump and contribute to risks that inflation could stage a global comeback.\nBut the cartel's increasingly fractious members are pushing to pump more and maximize short-term profits, in part due to the expectation of growing competition from U.S. shale drillers emboldened by former President Donald Trump's re-election.\n\"We have more liquid gold than any country in the world,\" Trump said in his victory speech on Nov. 6. \"More than Saudi Arabia. We have more than Russia.\"\nAhead of Thursday's scheduled meeting of OPEC+, that creates a dilemma for its de facto leadership in Riyadh: continue defending the price of oil, or fight to take back market share.\nIt appears the Saudis aren't inclined to start another price war.\nSaudi officials say the kingdom is likely to keep the spigots tight on its own production, further pushing back plans to loosen them that were already delayed twice.\n\"They won't be able to bring oil back online next year,\" said a Saudi official.\nYet another major producer, the United Arab Emirates, has been allowed to add more barrels into the market from January. And Iraq and Kazakhstan are also lobbying the cartel to bring more production of their own, which would boost supplies further and likely depress prices.\nOPEC+ is composed of the core Saudi-led cartel as well as a group of other major oil-producing allies, including Russia.\nThe Saudis tried to fight U.S. shale by waging a price war in 2014 and 2020 but ultimately failed to rein in mounting American production.\nThis time around, the kingdom's officials are wary of making a bold move before Trump signals where he would like prices to be, they said. While the president-elect has previously said he wanted to ease pain at the pump for consumers, his campaign was funded by oilmen who also benefit from higher prices.\nCrude output in the Americas has already helped slash the OPEC+ slice of global supplies to some of its lowest levels since the broader group's 2016 founding.\nOPEC+ production cuts, pushed by Saudi Arabia, have made that even more uncomfortable for other members.\n\"It's really easy to be part of a cartel when a market is growing,\" said Jorge Leon, a Rystad Energy analyst who formerly worked for OPEC. \"Nobody wants to be in a cartel where they are cutting production.\"\nThe upshot is that OPEC+ has lost some of its geopolitical heft in Washington. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Geoffrey Pyatt said the cartel's market power these days is \"less than you would imagine\" as oil producers elsewhere -- Brazil, Canada and Guyana -- pump gushers of crude."}

All rights reserved.\n\nTrump Should Challenge the Fed's Policies\n\nBy Judy Shelton\n724 words\n\n29 November 2024\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nJ\n\nA15\n\nEnglish\n\nCopyright 2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nNow that Donald Trump is the president-elect, expect warnings about the dangers of compromising the\nindependence of the Federal Reserve. Monetary officials will solemnly explain that politics should play no part\nin decisions about long-term financial stability. We should be more concerned about the concentrated power\nheld by the 12 voting members of the Fed's Open Market Committee. Their decisions can decrease or\nincrease unemployment, lower or raise inflation, and repress or stimulate economic growth.\nThe Fed's decisions reward some people and hurt others, with obvious political implications. Almost 62% of\nthe gain in U.S. household wealth over the past four years went to those in the top 10% wealth percentile\ngroup. These outsize gains for the wealthiest Americans are a result of monetary policy that sent stock\nprices soaring, which primarily benefited people already flush with assets.\nThis kind of wealth inequality prompts voters to demand change. Mr. Trump built his economic agenda\naround addressing these grievances, promising lower inflation, lower interest rates, higher wages and\nhigher growth. But unless these goals align with the Fed's model for achieving its dual mandate -- maximum\nemployment and stable prices -- the central bank could undercut Mr. Trump's agenda.\nThe Fed chairman can strongly influence public opinion about the economy. Two days after the election,\nChairman Jerome Powell announced a 25 basis-point cut in the Fed's target interest rate. This followed the\njumbo 50 basis-point cut announced in September, a decision that Mr. Powell said would advance the Fed's\ngoals of labor-market strength with \"moderate growth and inflation moving sustainably down to 2%\".\nThis \"recalibration\" of the Fed's policy, as Mr. Powell called it, may indicate that the central bank is switching\nto a supply-side model for deciding the amount of money and credit available to the economy. The theory is\nthat low unemployment and private-sector growth are the solutions to -- not the causes of -- inflation, which\nactually results from demand pressures.\nIf the Fed has embraced this theory, it will be welcome news to Mr. Trump. Along with tax and regulation\ncuts, a reduction in borrowing costs would dovetail with his goals by providing more affordable access to\ncapital, leading to increased output.\nThe problem is that some Fed officials seem all too ready to revert to their former framework. Under this\nmodel, the Fed uses its tools to decrease demand, not increase supply. It may opt once again for restrictive\ninterest rates and diminished growth, even pre-emptively, to reduce inflationary pressures.\nIf Mr. Trump and the Fed do go to battle, then Mr. Trump would be facing a stubborn opponent. Just ask\nformer British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who waged a similar supply-side campaign against her central bank.\nHer plan to spur investment and growth through lower taxes was undermined by the Bank of England, which\nsaid the effects of her changes threatened its idea of \"financial stability.\" This crippled her agenda and got her\nbooted from 10 Downing Street.\nInstead of raising the specter of a tyrannical president seizing control from the Fed, we should be questioning\nwhy an independent agency has such enormous power to skew financial outcomes. Why are there no limits\non how much U.S. Treasury debt the Fed can purchase? No limits on how much money it can print? No limits\non the interest it can pay at taxpayer expense to commercial banks on their accounts held at the Fed? And\nwhy are there no rules safeguarding the long-term integrity of the dollar while the Fed pursues its target of 2%\ninflation? Does Congress support the Fed's devaluation policy?\nMany of those who warn against \"politicizing\" the Fed are resistant to introducing any rules-based approach\nto interest-rate setting. Testifying before Congress as Fed chairman in 2015, Janet Yellen tersely informed\nthe House Financial Services Committee, \"I don't believe that the Fed should chain itself to any mechanical\nrule.\" Unchained from rules -- now that's tyranny."}

{"title": "Crypto Firm Has Friend in Commerce Pick", "date": "25 November 2024", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "Crypto Firm Has Friend in Commerce Pick\n\nBy Angus Berwick, Ben Foldy, Jenny Strasburg and Eliot Brown\n1,684 words\n\nThe presidential transition adviser Howard Lutnick's most important client is Donald Trump. But as chairman of the Wall Street trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick counts as one of his other most important clients an ex-plastic surgeon named Giancarlo Devasini, the owner of the cryptocurrency firm Tether.\n\nLutnick and Devasini each have a big interest in future administration policy. Devasini said privately this year that Lutnick will use his political clout to try to defuse threats facing Tether, according to business associates of the two men.\n\nTrump this past week selected Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, which would place him in a crucial position overseeing the administration's economic agenda. In his current role as co-chair of the transition team, Lutnick is vetting candidates for other top government jobs that could involve supervising Tether.\n\nTrump's election heralds a new era for the cryptocurrency industry, which has faced a series of legal crackdowns in the Biden era. The incoming administration has promised to embrace crypto and create industry-friendly regulations. Few institutions stand to benefit more from a change in crypto policy than Tether -- and by extension, Cantor.\n\nTether, whose unregulated cryptocurrency of the same name has spawned a hard-to-police shadow financial system, is under investigation by the Treasury and Justice departments for possible violations of anti-money-laundering and sanctions laws, The Wall Street Journal reported in October, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nA Tether spokesperson pointed to comments made in response to the previous Journal article, which said that to suggest the company was \"involved in aiding criminal actors or sidestepping sanctions is outrageous.\" Cantor, which is majority-owned by Lutnick, holds most of Tether's $134 billion in assets, largely U.S. Treasury bills, in exchange for tens of millions of dollars of fees each year, according to people familiar with Cantor's business.\n\nCantor's relationship with Tether deepened when the trading firm struck a deal to invest in the crypto giant, Lutnick and Devasini have each told business associates. Under the agreement, which was made in the past year, Cantor stood to receive about a 5% ownership interest in Tether. The interest, which hasn't been previously reported, was valued by Cantor at as much as $600 million, according to some of the business associates.\n\nLutnick, in a statement Thursday, said he would step down from Cantor once the Senate confirms him as commerce secretary. He said he intended to divest himself of interests in his companies to comply with government ethics rules. The Commerce Department hasn't historically played a major role in overseeing the crypto industry.\n\nIn a statement sent before Lutnick's selection as commerce secretary, the Tether spokesperson said that \"Tether's relationship with Cantor is entirely professional, based on managing reserves. The claim that Lutnick's involvement in a transition team somehow translates to influence over regulatory actions is laughable.\" A Cantor spokeswoman declined to comment on the firm's relationship with Tether, including on the ownership interest.\n\nTether operates the world's most transacted cryptocurrency. Known as a stablecoin for its 1:1 backing with the U.S. dollar, tether gained a foothold among crypto speculators as a safe way to cash out trading profits. It has also caught the attention of government officials who say tether is a preferred medium for Russian arms dealers, international fraud rings and terrorist organizations to move money."}

All rights reserved.\nThe company said earlier this year that it cooperates with law enforcement and freezes digital wallets\nconnected to sanctioned entities.\nLutnick and Devasini are both outsiders. Lutnick's firm is a storied, scrappy Wall Street player. Devasini's\ncompany is a crypto operation that by its nature disrupts the government-backed currency system.\nDevasini, an Italian who has refused to travel to the U.S. for fear of arrest, according to some business\nassociates, sees Lutnick as a shield against the efforts of U.S. authorities and rivals to disrupt his lucrative\nbusiness. He considers Lutnick a highly effective communicator with U.S. politicians given the Cantor boss's\nreputation for rebuilding the firm after two-thirds of its New York employees died in the Sept. 11, 2001,\nattacks on the World Trade Center.\nThis article is based on interviews with people familiar with both of their businesses. The Journal reviewed\nmeeting notes, emails and flight records that supported interviewees' accounts.\nLutnick and Devasini's relationship started in earnest during Tether's time of need.\nIn 2021, Tether and a related crypto exchange agreed to pay $61 million to settle civil charges by the New\nYork attorney general and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly misrepresenting the\nassets supporting the stablecoin. Tether, whose holding company is registered in the British Virgin Islands,\nhad never released fully audited financials. Tether didn't admit wrongdoing in the settlements.\nAfter the settlements, Tether's primary asset manager, a private Bahamian bank called Deltec, lost several of\nits relationships with foreign banks that it used to clear payments. This threatened to choke off the channels\nthrough which Tether could receive customers' real-world dollars in exchange for issuances of its token.\nSpokespeople for Deltec didn't respond to requests for comment.\nTether initially moved most of its assets, which totaled about $40 billion at the time, to another Bahamian\nbank. Richard Heathcote, an investment adviser who had headed Deltec's trading desk, then connected\nDevasini to Cantor, some of the business associates said. Devasini later hired Heathcote, once a broker in\nLondon at Cantor's brokerage affiliate BGC Group, as Tether's chief investment officer to manage the\ncompany's portfolio.\nHeathcote didn't respond to requests for comment.\nLutnick, who has a knack for taking on edgier corners of finance such as sports betting and special-purpose\nacquisition companies, met Devasini in the Bahamas around late 2021 to find out whether Tether had the\nassets it claimed it did. The 60-year-old Italian, who has never spoken publicly about Tether, splits his time\nbetween his Bahamian beachside mansion and homes on the French Riviera and in the Swiss Alps. He has\nrun Tether almost since its founding in 2014, following careers as a plastic surgeon and an electronics\nimporter, according to people familiar with the company.\n\"I said, 'Show me the money,'\" Lutnick told a crypto conference in July. \"And we found every penny, and they\nhad every penny, but they had it in what I would call pretty godforsaken places,\" he said, noting Tether's\nholdings of short-term loans to Chinese companies, known as commercial paper.\nAs the commercial-paper loans matured, Tether sent money to Cantor to buy supersafe Treasurys. Cantor's\nlong-established position in the Treasury market, where it is a so-called primary dealer that trades directly\nwith the Federal Reserve, would ensure that Tether could easily sell assets to meet any client requests for\ndollars.\nSome of Tether's closest customers -- mostly crypto-trading firms that sell the token into a vast secondary\nmarket -- have used Cantor to facilitate trades worth billions of dollars, according to business associates.\nThe arrangement has allowed Lutnick and his team to profit from a lucrative trade in cryptocurrencies,\nwhich they don't hold themselves. It has also put them at the center of an extraordinary financial relationship\ninvolving Tether, the largest stablecoin in circulation, and Cantor Fitzgerald, one of the most respected firms\non Wall Street.\nLutnick, a registered Republican, was juggling his job as Cantor's chairman and chief executive, and his roles\nheading Cantor's related Wall Street arms, when Trump turned to him about a year ago to help his\npresidential bid.\nat Cantor, Lutnick restricted the number of employees who had contact with Tether to a handful of top\nexecutives, according to some of the business associates. He often handled the relationship himself, flying by\nprivate jet to meet Devasini in various crypto-friendly places around the world, including El Salvador, which\ncounts bitcoin as a legal tender."}

All rights reserved.\n\nStreetwise: Inflation Protection Won't Be Simple\n\nBy James Mackintosh\n\n864 words\n\n25 November 2024\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\n\nJ\n\nB1\n\nEnglish\n\nCopyright 2024 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nWith a strong economy and an incoming president promising tax cuts and tariffs, investors and economists\nare rightly worrying that inflation might make a comeback. Unfortunately, one of the standard ways to guard\nagainst it -- buying commodities, especially oil -- offers less protection than usual.\nThe twin inflation risks are well understood: supply shocks and demand surges. War in the Middle East has\nthe potential to threaten energy supplies, while tax cuts into an economy with near-full employment ought to\nlift prices.\nThe extra threats to inflation don't fit either model, though. Tariffs and deportations would both be likely to\npush up inflation, but would also hit the economy. \u201cCommodities won't protect you from that,\u201d says Christian\nMueller-Glissmann, head of asset allocation research at Goldman Sachs.\nThe problem has shown up in price moves since the election. The market measure of expected inflation over\nthe next five years, known as the break-even, had its biggest jump in more than a year after the result, having\nrisen as traders bet on Donald Trump winning.\nYet, gold, oil and copper are all down. Have they lost their ability to protect against inflation? To answer this,\nthink about three different causes of inflation.\nFirst, oil. Clearly, oil will still protect against one of the most common causes of runaway inflation: a soaring\noil price resulting from strikes on oil facilities in the Middle East. Yet, that has become much less likely.\nShocks to world oil supply are being damped by large stocks and excess production capacity, as well as by\nthe U.S.'s status as a net exporter, a sharp change compared with the inflationary era of the 1970s. Far from\nsoaring as Israel stepped up its fight with Iran's proxies and Iran itself, crude is stuck around $70 a barrel.\nPresident-elect Trump's pledge to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d and his selection of a fracking executive as nominee for\nenergy secretary and oil prices suggest downward pressure on prices in the U.S., too.\nSecond, stronger growth. It should also raise inflation. Usually oil and copper are good ways to protect\nagainst growth-driven inflation as demand for both rises. But the decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese\neconomies by tariffs might stymie this effect. China is the biggest source of demand for raw materials, but\nmight not be helped much or at all by stronger U.S. growth.\nThird, Trump's tariff and migrant-deportation plans. Both could increase inflation.\nTariffs have nuanced effects on inflation. The immediate impact is to raise prices, much like a sales tax, as\nwell as pushing up the dollar. In the long run, they should slow the economy -- again, like a tax rise -- which\nshould reduce inflationary pressure. The mixed effects show up in higher expectations for inflation in the\nnear term, but little change in inflation expectations beyond the next five years.\nThis sort of action is hard to protect against. Tariffs shouldn't help oil and industrial metals, and might hurt\nthem as trade wars threaten a weaker world economy and so less demand. Gold could struggle as tariffs will\npush up the dollar, tending to weaken the gold price and make interest-rate cuts less likely.\nIf the new administration manages to remove many millions of migrants who entered the country illegally, it\nwould surely push up wages for the worst-paid as companies compete to replace low-cost workers. Since the\npoor tend to spend all their income, that ought to boost spending and feed through to prices both as\ncompanies try to make up for their higher costs and from the extra demand the higher spending creates.\nAgain, this is the wrong sort of inflation for oil or copper.\nThe industry with the highest exposure to illegal migrant labor is farming, so this should have the biggest\neffect on food prices -- potentially making agricultural futures a way to protect against this. But agriculture isn't\na market for the fainthearted, with lots of volatility and a need to understand the details of each crop."}

All rights reserved.\n\nGlencore acquired the Horne Smelter in Quebec in its 2013 merger with Xstrata. Copper was first recycled there when shell casings were melted down after World War II. Electronics recycling was pioneered there in the 1980s after the local mine ran out.\n\nPrevious owners established a San Jose, Calif., collection facility for old computers and another in Rhode Island to receive, sample for copper and precious-metal content, and price materials such as circuit boards, factory-floor choppings and even old silverware. Glencore recently bought a failed electronics recycling facility in Arkansas and will use it, too, to gather scrap, Sinha said.\n\nGlencore traders in Toronto, Switzerland and New York are assigned to find scrap. Material from about 40 countries winds up in Rouyn-Noranda, having come to Glencore in quantities ranging from small packages to full shipping containers. There is even a bin at the smelter's gate, where the remote town's 42,000 residents dump old wires and broken toasters.\n\nGlencore is also working with manufacturers of electronics and solar panels to design products so that they are easier to break down and recycle, Sinha said. \"Most people don't produce things with their end of life in mind,\" he said.\n\nIt is also looking in landfills where automobiles have been dumped. When cars are junked, useful parts and much of the metal is stripped away before the rest is reduced to a material called auto shredded residue, or auto fluff.\n\nGlencore already buys copper stripped from cars before they are shredded. Its suppliers are starting to excavate landfills packed with fluff to get the copper that wasn't worth the trouble for earlier scrappers. In trials, Glencore found that the concentration of copper in landfilled auto fluff can be more than twice that found in geologic mines.\n\nThe scrap piled up in Quebec is shredded further and fed into the smelter, where temperatures reach 1,200 degrees Celsius. Scrap usually makes up about 15% of the input, Sinha said. The smelter's chief metallurgist blends it with concentrate from mines, accounting for plastic and other materials that affect the process's heat and chemistry.\n\n\"We can change this recipe as long as we can still chemically balance it,\" Sinha said. \"We can feed more recycling and we can feed more of one type of recyclable material if that's better for us to buy.\"\n\nEventually, 750-pound anodes are formed by pouring molten metal into a revolving casting wheel. The red-hot slabs are hung to cool, then hauled 400 miles to Glencore's Montreal refinery. There, they are melted anew to remove and collect the remaining traces of other metals: platinum, palladium, silver and gold."}

Investors have piled into stocks after the U.S. election, relieved that the contentious presidential contest is over and confident that Trump's victory will lead to easier regulation and a flurry of dealmaking that will give markets a boost. The optimism sent U.S. stocks to their best week of the year, and the gains continued Monday. The U.S. dollar strengthened, and major indexes continued their record run. The Dow industrials rose 304.14 points, or 0.7%, and closed at a record 44293.13. The S&P 500, up 5.81 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq, up 11.99 points, or 0.1%, also closed at records. Shares of Tesla and Trump Media kept soaring, along with banks. The U.S. bond market was closed for Veterans Day. Up ahead this week are October inflation data and earnings from companies including Home Depot and Walt Disney. Traders also are on the alert for any hint of appointments or policy moves by the president-elect. Elsewhere: -- In corporate news, Cigna stock rallied after the health insurer said it wasn't seeking to buy Humana. Meanwhile, AbbVie shares slid after the company's experimental schizophrenia drug failed in trials, while shares of rival Bristol-Myers Squibb surged. -- Oil prices extended recent declines, with Brent crude slipping 2.8% to $71.83 a barrel.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nHere are some things that have been touted as a \"Trump trade,\" a bet on Donald Trump winning the election:\n\n-- Buy Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), which runs his favored social media.\n\n-- Buy bitcoin, gold and the dollar.\n\n-- Sell Treasurys and the Mexican peso.\n\n-- Buy healthcare and prison stocks; sell clean-energy stocks.\n\n-- Buy European defense stocks.\n\n-- Buy banks, especially regional banks.\n\n-- Buy U.S. stocks while selling the rest of the world.\n\nThere are plenty more, but the record of just this handful ought to give investors pause before they place their\n\nbets.\n\nSome of these strategies have clearly worked, but with questionable logic.\n\nOthers worked but at least in part for the wrong reasons. Some failed miserably.\n\nThe past month has offered a perfect test. In the now-legal political betting markets Trump and Democrat\n\nnominee Kamala Harris were neck-and-neck in early October, when he began to pull decisively ahead.\n\nTrump trades should have done well.\n\nThe most obvious trade is DJT, and it worked perfectly. The stock rose and occasionally fell almost exactly in\n\nline with the betting odds, more than tripling in price by last Tuesday, before tumbling as his odds worsened a\n\nlittle in the past few days.\nThe problem with DJT is that it isn't clear what happens if Trump wins.\n\nThe company is sitting on a lot of cash, but the actual business, branded as the Truth Social network, barely\n\nexists. Sales of $836,900 (yes, less than $1 million) in the second quarter were down almost one-third\n\ncompared with a year earlier, and operating losses rose fivefold to $18.7 million.\n\nThe story has to be that Trump wins, favors Truth Social and users and money pour in. But quite how it could\n\njustify its market value of $6.1 billion, more than 3,000 times annual sales, is pure speculation.\nThe other successful Trump trade has been private prisons. Geo Group and CoreCivic have risen and, since\n\nlast Tuesday, fallen, with Trump's betting odds. Unlike DJT, there is good logic for how to make money from a\n\nTrump administration that enforces mass deportations.\nNone of the other Trump trades has moved as perfectly with the betting odds as DJT, and all are\n\nquestionable. Start with what worked since Oct. 4.\nThe dollar is up. Bond yields are up. And gold is up. But were they really up because of bets on a Trump\n\nWhite House? Bond yields and the dollar are easily explained without considering the election, as both\n\nusually rise with a stronger economy -- and the U.S. economy was surprisingly strong.\nGold has been on a tear for a while, amid concerns about global tensions and moves away from the dollar as\n\na reserve currency. Trump might be better or worse for gold than Harris, but either way the price actually\n\nrose more when his odds were falling during September than it has since Trump was at 50-50."}
{"title": "Investors Find It Hard to Bet on Politics", "date": "", "source": "", "content": "Mexico's peso has moved more closely with Trump's odds, and given his threats to trade, this makes sense.\n\nBut its weakening also began with the exiting president's remaking of the judiciary, which has worried\ninvestors. My guess is some of the peso weakening is the Trump trade, but quite how much is hard to split\nout from dollar strength and the justice system concerns.\n\nBitcoin is up, which fits with Trump's promise to create a bitcoin \"strategic reserve\" and make the U.S. the\ncrypto capital of the planet.\" Bitcoin is sure to get an easier ride from regulators if he wins.\n\nYet, like gold, bitcoin rose more as Harris's odds improved in September than it has since Oct. 4. Day-to-day\nmoves in bitcoin haven't been particularly closely tied to how Trump's betting odds shifted, either, or to the\nDJT stock price, moving in the same direction a little over half the days since Oct. 4. The broad direction is\nright for a Trump trade, but bitcoin's daily moves are driven by vibes, not economics or politics.\n\nDrill down into the stock market and plenty of putative Trump trades haven't really worked even as his odds\nimproved from 50-50.\n\nHealthcare stocks have fallen about 3%, the opposite of what was claimed for them based on his dislike of\nObamacare. Solar stocks are actually down less than the oil-dominated energy sector, but with both down\nclose to 6% the gap is too small to matter.\n\nEuropean defense was meant to be a Trump trade because concern about his isolationism would force\ncountries both to spend more protecting themselves and to reduce their reliance on U.S.-made weapons\nsystems. Yet European defense stocks are down on average, while when Harris's odds were improving in\nSeptember they were up.\n\nTrump's threats of tariffs are the biggest policy economists worry about, with forecasters mostly agreeing that\nthey would slow the economy and increase inflation. But in the stock market, the tariff threat is hard to see in\nprices. Stocks of some retailers that import a lot and would suffer from tariffs, such as RH and Target, have\nfallen, but so have those of companies with significant U.S. production, such as Arhaus, which ought to be\nrelative winners.\n\nBanks seem to offer more clarity. Big banks beat the S&P, and regional banks did better still, with the Trump\ntrade theory of lower regulation offering support. But the most obvious Trump bank trade is Flagstar Financial,\nThe New York bank bailed out by Steven Mnuchin, Trump's former Treasury secretary.\n\nIts shares have fallen sharply, even as the rest of the sector has rallied. Perhaps the bank rally is more about\nthe fast-growing economy than the Trump trade.\n\nFinally, there is the America First story: Buy America, sell everything else.\n\nThis one has worked, but not as Trump traders might hope. The S&P 500 is down since Oct. 4, but the trade\nworked because stocks in the rest of the world fell far more, in dollar terms. Yet, the trade also worked when\nHarris's odds were improving in September, when the rest of the world rose, but the S&P rose far more.\n\nIt is hard for investors to bet on politics. If you must, the cleanest way to do it is in the betting markets, not the\nstock market."}

All rights reserved.\nTrying to buy a specific commodity before the rally occurs is hard, even for professional managers, says\nRobert Minter, director of investment strategy at asset-management company Abrdn. Commodity markets are\ndynamic and changes in supply will move them, including weather, politics and other factors that are difficult\nto forecast.\nMarket pros recommend dollar-cost averaging, which is buying a set amount at specific intervals until the\ninvestor reaches his or her target allocation, or watching for price dips.\nMinter says investors researching broad commodity-index-based ETFs should study the underlying index's\nconstruction so they get the exposure they want. Comparing two popular indexes as an example, he notes\nthat nearly 60% of the S&P GSCI Commodity Index is composed of energy markets, while energy only makes\nup about 29% of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. The big difference in weighting will affect the return of\nthose indexes.\nHe suggests investors dig into the index's sector holdings as well. Some commodity indexes may exclude\nmarkets that often have heightened volatility, such as natural gas. Not having exposure to natural gas means\ninvestors are missing out on changes in electricity-markets pricing during the summer or home-heating\ndemand in the winter, Minter adds.\nHaving a commodities allocation isn't a set-it-and-forget it investment. The asset's volatility means allocations\ncan easily grow or shrink beyond the 5% benchmark. Unlike stocks where some investors let their winners\nride to compound gains, market pros say rebalancing is necessary.\n\"If you had a 5% allocation, and it's grown to 7%, then you want to trim the trees a little bit.

First of all, Biden, who doesn't know he is alive -- Biden said that he expects there to be a lot of trouble if I win the election. That's a very bad statement for him to make. He said that. That's where this came from.\" Mr. Trump digresses into his poll numbers and has to be brought back on topic.\nMs. Noonan: \u00abBut you would never do that?\"\nMr. Trump: \u00abOf course I wouldn't. But now, if you're talking about you're going to have riots on the street, you would certainly bring the National Guard in. As an example, in Minneapolis while I was there\u2026 meaning while he was in office -- they had riots, literal riots. That whole city was burning down. And Minnesota, the governor was supposed to -- our favorite governor -- the governor was supposed to do it. He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. And I said, 'You got to get the National Guard.\u2026 \nAnd when you looked over the shoulder of that poor guy from CNN, that poor, stupid reporter who was standing there saying, 'This seems to be a peaceful demonstration,' then he gets hit on the leg with a rock, and behind him the whole city was burning. It looked like World War II in Berlin, and he's trying to say that it's peaceful. So I insisted that the National Guard -- if I didn't do that, I don't think you would've had a city left. So I'm only talking about in cases like that where you need help. You can't say, 'I'll never bring in everything,' as the entire country is disappearing in bedlam. But certainly not against my opponents -- it's against civil unrest.\nOne item that wasn't on Mr. Trump's list of things we got wrong is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, most provisions of which expire at the end of 2025. \u00abYou were very supportive,\" he acknowledges. But how supportive is he? Recently he has proposed exempting all manner of income from taxes -- tips, overtime, Social Security benefits.\n\"You probably recall the famous phrase from the '70s, 'Gucci Gulch,'\" columnist Daniel Henninger says in framing the question.

Then he says, \"I would like to have not the cap. I would like to have it the way it was.\" That draws some assent among the overtaxed New Yorkers on the editorial board -- even here, some politics is local -- but Mr. Gigot speaks for the institution when he says, \"We believe in the policy that's best for the country.\"\nA subject Mr. Trump doesn't discuss is Kamala Harris.

American factory jobs used to promise a middle-class life for blue-collar workers like Merwin and his sons, now in their 30s. But that is no longer true for many manufacturing workers -- even as presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have campaigned on reviving such jobs.\n\nThat tension is behind the strike at Boeing, where the average machinist makes around $75,000 and wages haven't kept up with the cost of living. \"I've watched my kids struggle to have what they have,\" said Merwin, 58 years old, a parts inspector who works at Boeing's Auburn, Wash., plant. He will receive a pension when he retires; his youngest son won't.\n\n\"The opportunity for people coming into this company is not the same as what it used to be.\" Some 33,000 members of Boeing's largest union have been on strike since Sept. 13. Members overwhelmingly rejected a contract that would have raised pay by 25% over four years. Boeing sweetened its offer to a 30%, which the union said still falls short.\n\nThe union says Boeing, in the past decade, has raised wages by 8% -- when inflation has measured more than 46% nationally. The Merwin family's connection to Boeing started with Tony's father, Ray Merwin, who in the 1960s was living in South Dakota and working at a gold mine.\n\nWithin the decade, Boeing would construct its sprawling Everett factory, where the company has built planes -- from the 747 to the 787 Dreamliner -- before it moved all production of the 787 to South Carolina. When Tony was an infant, a relative called his father to join him at the factory. That move, in 1966, started nearly six decades of Merwins at Boeing.\n\nTony's mother, Maria Merwin, took a job as a clerk at the jet maker. For the young family, Boeing was a way out of low-income, dangerous mining work. Tony recalls growing up in a newly constructed three-bedroom rambler. As Boeing churned out jetliners in the suburbs of Seattle, subdivisions cropped up, populated by ranch and split-level homes.\n\nMicrosoft moved there in 1979 and went public seven years later, birthing a wave of young tech millionaires. Jeff Bezos founded Amazon.com the following decade.\n\nMultimillion-dollar homes filled once-open land and glittering condo towers cropped up along the lake shore. By 2020, Seattle and the surrounding area had among the nation's priciest homes and least-affordable communities.\n\nThe median worker at Microsoft in 2023 made nearly $200,000. The average wage at an Amazon warehouse is $22 an hour -- no college degree required -- compared with about $21 on average to start on the line at Boeing.\n\nAt 23, Tony was hired as a wing line mechanic on a military plane. He jumped between jobs at Boeing. The work provided a middle-class life, where bonuses and overtime paychecks went toward vacations, band trips and college tuition for his daughter."}

{"title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Silver Is Having A Golden Moment", "date": "28 September 2024", "source": "The Wall Street Journal", "content": "All that glitters isn't just gold -- it's also silver. The commodity's price is up about 34% so far this year, outpacing gold, which keeps hitting record highs. Year to date, about $856 million has flowed into the iShares Silver Trust, an exchange-traded fund that owns physical silver bullion, according to FactSet. Wheaton Precious Metals, a company that owns the rights to precious metals from mines, including gold and silver, is up about 30%. Demand for silver has been strong, both as a store of value and as an industrial commodity. The Silver Institute, an industry association, estimates that demand for silver has been outrunning supply for the past three years. It projects another deficit this year. One reason is that mine production has been weak. More than 70% of mined silver is a byproduct of other metals, such as lead, zinc, copper and gold. Prices for zinc have been weak, prompting mine closures. Last year, a major mine in Mexico -- the world's top supplier -- didn't operate for four months because of a strike. At the same time, demand from industrial uses has been growing, in large part thanks to solar-panel manufacturing, where silver is integral. Solar-sector demand for silver jumped 158% from 2019 to 2023, according to the Silver Institute. The group expects that demand to grow an additional 20% this year. The market would be roughly in balance if not for investors' taste for silver coins and bars. This year's silver rally has been driven in part by investors looking to precious metals as a store of value on signs of weakening in the U.S. economy, according to Max Layton, global head of commodities research at Citi Research. Expectations of lower rates are another reason why: Demand for noninterest-bearing assets tends to rise when rates decline. Gold prices have appreciated precisely for those reasons, and silver prices are historically linked to gold. For now, there is still plenty of silver stacked away in vaults to cushion deficits. There was about 15 months of annual mined silver supply stored in London and exchange-registered vaults at the end of 2023, according to a report from the Silver Institute. But those inventories have dwindled by about 26% over the past two years. The Silver Institute and Citi Research each expect another market deficit in 2024, which implies that aboveground silver stocks could fall further. What else might drive silver prices even higher? Worth watching is China, where Layton says weakness in the property and consumer sectors is driving up appetite for silver as a store of value at the same time that the country's aggressive build-out of solar energy and electric vehicles is stoking demand for it as an industrial commodity. This differs from commodities such as oil, which are negatively affected by China's so-called bifurcated economy, and other metals such as gold, which enjoy retail demand from weakened property prices but not so much from the clean-energy transition. Notably, China in August issued quotas on gold imports for several Chinese banks, according to a report from Reuters. This might be diverting retail investment toward silver, according to a report from Citi, which notes that the country's silver-bullion imports -- a proxy for retail demand -- went from almost nothing to more than $100 million earlier this year. If China shifts to buying silver at just 10% of the pace it has been buying gold, that could lead to demand that equates to about 20% of mined silver supply, according to Citi. Another catalyst worth watching is the Fed's trajectory. If the central bank keeps cutting interest rates, that could stimulate more demand for gold and silver. Secondarily, if lower interest rates encourage more industrial activity in the U.S., especially debt-reliant solar projects, that could further drive up silver demand. Silver seems poised to sparkle a while longer."}

Weighing on the Dow, Amgen shares fell 5.5% after analysts were underwhelmed by the results of a late-stage study of a drug that would treat a type of eczema. Visa dropped 1.2% after sliding 5.5% on Tuesday, when the Justice Department said it was suing the company for antitrust violations. Economic data could play a bigger role in driving markets the rest of the week. Data on weekly unemployment claims and durable goods orders will be released on Thursday. On Friday, the Commerce Department will release data on personal income and spending trends, as well as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge."}

With additional cuts expected in the months ahead, investors are looking to history to gauge what's next.

The dollar moved higher in 2001 because of a variety of factors, including investors seeking safety in the dollar after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Gold Gold, often perceived as a haven and a hedge against inflation, tends to benefit from rate reductions. That is because it pays no income, which investors usually mind less when rates are lower."}

The rally was a delayed yet emphatic response to the central bank's decision Wednesday to cut interest rates by a half percentage point that pushed the S&P 500 to its first record high since mid July and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close above 42000 points for the first time."}
